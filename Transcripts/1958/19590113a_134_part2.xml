          <heading>Argument of James H. Heller</heading>
          <turn speaker="james_h_heller" startTime="0.000" stopTime="496.717">
            <label>Mr. James H. Heller</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">-- giving the example of a supposed instance where Congress had got -- gone at bank robbery, robbery of national banks as indirectly as it went at narcotics in this case and I think I have previously said that it went at narcotics indirectly because of -- perhaps to a degree, an attempt to make it easy to indentify the narcotics, but most particularly because it had some doubts, doubts which the Government in its own brief in the Blockburger case which was quite late in this part of the history of the narcotics laws conceded were substantial, some doubts whether it could simply say narcotics sales within this country are illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.283" offset="292551">I don't know whether those doubts are still valid or not, I think there are later cases which indicate that they would not be any obstacle right now to a direct passage of a law saying you can't sell the following narcotics, unless you were a doctor or one of an accepted group.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.560" offset="373635">The bank robbery case, I -- I suppose was one in which they carefully left out however the offence of robbing the bank just as Congress carefully avoided saying anything about simply selling narcotic A, B and C.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.330" offset="432671">The closest it came to that it was in the Import Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.400" offset="448972">I think there is a case that something like this, it's a case which I didn't cite in this brief, but it was cited in the Gore briefs and I relied on them heavily because of the massive legislative history that's contained in both briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.925" offset="499022">Ex Parte Neilsen at 131 United Sates reports, was not two different statutes but it was two different sections of a law which Congress had passed for the territory of Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.072" offset="543640">And one of them was a law involving bigamy, and one of them was a law involving adultery, and it's very, very significant or at least it's a good coincidence in a sense that this is very close to the case of Morey versus Commonwealth in 108 Massachusetts reports from which Blockburger draws its quoted strength at least.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.337" offset="632769">That is -- that's the original statement of the different evidence rule, the Blockburger rule in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.419" offset="665057">But in Ex Parte Neilsen, this Court declined to allow double punishment under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.518" offset="705494">So I don't think, I am not arguing about whether the theories of these cases proceed directly in the manner that we suggested in Gore and that we suggest here, but I don't think that there is any obstacle to this Court simply because Congress without an intent or concern to correlate laws as the Gore opinion suggested they might be in a single provision of law with provisos, I don't think the fact that Congress neglected to do that, having -- being concerned with the narcotics matter in this country for something now 50 years, is conclusive upon this Court's power or its -- its right in its own discretion to say that as a rule of prosecution leading to punishment, you may not treble these counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.552" offset="897546">If they are closely related as these are, if the statutes aim at the same offense, but simply impose different requirements as the history indicates to ensure detection and to ensure that there is no kind of person engaging in this activity who can go scot free because of the loophole in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.393" offset="972988">And that I think is the substance of the narcotics laws history.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.014" offset="987408">I -- I intend not to -- to stay on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.194" offset="1004126">There are other -- other reasons and they were largely summarized I think in the Chief Justice's dissent in the Gore case.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.417" offset="1037040">There is the later history of the law, the severity of the punishment, the attempt to achieve uniform punishment, the fact that under this pattern of prosecution, the first offender can get much more than the second or third offender was intended to get under any of those laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.859" offset="1094823">And second and third offenders are to a degree treated as -- as people who are consolidated offenders under these laws it seems.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.226" offset="1132231">I don't mean to say that their punishment is consolidated but the laws then refer to each other as -- as -- regards previous offences.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.368" offset="1164831">Those points have all been made before and -- and surely this is in a way a debate and surely as we argue, I think it is a matter of choices for the Court, choices in -- in what I think is a decent criminal jurisprudence and a choice which is open to it in its supervision of the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.334" offset="1248737">But the second question is the question of, if Blockburger applies or the different evidence rule as it's being called, how does it work and was it violated in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="298.066" offset="1295653">Now, this -- this branch of the case was -- was pretty clearly indicated in Justice Brennan's dissent in the Gore case and it also is to be argued I think almost exclusively in the Harris case that follows and I won't dwell on it very long.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.050" offset="1363571">But to go back to the evidence in this case, the evidence against the petitioner was in two basic parts, I won't say it's merely two facts but it's two factual aggregates.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.257" offset="1408397">First, the narcotics agents never saw him with the narcotics on him, nor did they see him with the marked money which they used to purchase it.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.480" offset="1445282">They did see Barbara Floyd with both of these on her.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.522" offset="1457507">They arrested him rather shortly after the last sale, it was about ten days, but they've searched his house and him and they found none of the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.396" offset="1484988">The indication seems to be that he was simply taking the money from Barbara Floyd and going out to somebody else and getting the narcotics and passing them back to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.158" offset="1519992">But of course that activity, Barbara Floyd testified to directly and it was corroborated heavily by the federal agents and there can't be any doubt that he was aiding and abetting her, and that is the first basic fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.130" offset="1571924">Secondly, Barbara Floyd herself testified that of course, he had the narcotics in his possession when he either got the money from her after he had gotten the money he'd gone out and come back and gave her the narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.548" offset="1621556">And possession is a rather important element in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.059" offset="1639633">I have assumed that the Court knew the laws that were involved in this case because they were all there in Gore, but I think it's important now to read them in connection with the way the -- this question of how Blockburger is applied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.637" offset="1701909">In the Narcotics Drug Import and Export Act, the statutes are printed at pages 2 to 4 of my brief, reads in pertinent part, "Whoever fraudulently or knowingly imports or brings any narcotic drug into the United States or any territory under its control or jurisdiction contrary to law, or receives, conceals, sells, or any in manner facilitates the transportation, concealment or sale of any such narcotic commits -- is -- is subject to punishment and imprisonment -- fine and imprisonment."</text>
            <text syncTime="436.318" offset="1848613">Now, the keywords in this indictment are concealment and sell under -- and sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.935" offset="1871078">Under count 6 and 12, petitioner was accused of facilitating the concealment and sale of unlawfully imported narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.666" offset="1914023">The second statute is the Stamp Tax Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.884" offset="1934921">"It shall be unlawful for any person to purchase, sell, dispense or distribute narcotic drugs except in the original stamped package or from the original stamped package."</text>
            <text syncTime="467.899" offset="1974941">And that was the statute which formed the basis of counts 5 and 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.087" offset="1999705">And finally the last one, the so-called written order statute dating from the 1914 Harrison Act, says, "It shall be unlawful for any person to sell, barter, exchange or give away narcotics drugs except in pursuance of a written order of the person to whom such article is sold, bartered, exchange or given on a prescribed form.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.591" offset="2081729">Two other features of these statutes --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="496.717" stopTime="499.082">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="496.717" offset="2090193">The written was the basis for which counts?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_h_heller" startTime="499.082" stopTime="1213.247">
            <label>Mr. James H. Heller</label>
            <text syncTime="499.082" offset="2099702">Oh, I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.751" offset="2102418">That was the basis for counts 4 and 10.It's hardly -- the statutes numerically are inverse to the order in which they appear in these companion counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.643" offset="2137945">That is, the last statute was the first count in each of these transactions 4 and 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.357" offset="2164799">The second one is the second count 5 and 11 and the first one is the third count, 6 and 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.765" offset="2186428">Now, two of these statutes have presumptions and of course Justice Brennan set them forth in his dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.240" offset="2212342">They are not quite the same presumptions, the import export law says, "Whenever on trial for a violation of this subdivision, the defendant is shown to have or to have had possession of the narcotic drug, such possession shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction unless the defendant explains the possession to the satisfaction of the jury."</text>
            <text syncTime="548.386" offset="2296874">That's mere possession of a narcotic drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.769" offset="2310457">The Stamp Tax section says, "However, the absence of appropriate tax paid stamps from narcotic drug shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of this section by a person in whose possession the same maybe found."</text>
            <text syncTime="565.567" offset="2365628">Now, that makes it a possession of unstamped narcotic, but as Justice Brennan pointed out, and this seemed perfectly clear, a possession of an unstamped narcotic drug will prove both of these instances, just as I suppose a murder would also prove manslaughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.394" offset="2432920">It's not that these are includable offences necessarily, but that the same evidence which will convict under the Stamp Tax Act at least will convict under the Import Export Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.415" offset="2485060">Now, of course these presumptions have been passed upon by this Court in certain context and I don't intend to go into their intrinsic reasonableness, although I think that might be the subject matter of another appeal in certain cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.288" offset="2532498">But the truth of the matter is that the same fact was shown, Barbara Floyd testified that he had these in his possession and there is the second factual aggregate or the second fact from which his guilt could be shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.081" offset="2599685">Now, recurring to the Blockburger test, the crucial portion of it is whether each statute requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.325" offset="2644720">And we think it's very clear that they don't require different proof here.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.138" offset="2659976">Whether one combines these statutes with the aiding and abetting act which is 18 U.S.C Section 2, and is printed in our brief, or whether one relies on the presumption arising from possession in the case of the two statutes which, which bear those presumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.317" offset="2728626">The same evidence was used here and the statutes required nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.207" offset="2748165">The Government counters that argument by saying that the statutes require what they say they require.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.703" offset="2774183">That is the full statutory offense as it is spelled out.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.805" offset="2790588">They require that you show that a man has -- has facilitated the concealment of sale of narcotics which he knew to be unlawfully imported and which were in fact unlawfully imported.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.811" offset="2838653">Well, they don't require that proof, that proof is almost never been given in any case, I think it's -- it's pretty clear that that would impose an insuperable burden on the Government in most cases to prove that a man knew that the narcotics were unlawfully imported.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.898" offset="2894973">Courts have speculated, this Court did in -- in the Yee Ham case that because the narcotics are unlawful, you might say that they were absolutely prima facie or at least they could presume that they were unlawfully imported.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.637" offset="2949935">But then in Jin Fuey Moy, they said the (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="716.256" offset="2968430">So, however the thing is read and I think Blockburger requires careful reading because it's a rule of evidence, it requires proof of an additional fact under one provision which the other does not and that wasn't met here.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.590" offset="3025690">Now, the Government's version of the statute, it seems to me comes down to saying whether east -- each statute does not require proof of the same fact as the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.454" offset="3061217">That is they would put the burden on the petitioner and you show that in every instance you have to prove the same facts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.538" offset="3089533">We don't think that is the burden, we think the burden of Blockburger is that it's a rule of evidence which the Government must satisfy before the case is submitted to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.071" offset="3127672">And I might point out that the way the case was submitted to the jury here, the jury was invited to rely on these presumptions, the charge is quoted at pages 12 and 15 of our brief and the Court emphasized them in these two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.272" offset="3184410">So as to aiding and abetting, the same evidence was shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.877" offset="3210846">It might be inferred that because he aided and abetted Barbara Floyd, he -- and he knew that she was dealing with a third person, he knew that she would sell the narcotics absents tax stamps, absence the receipt of a written order, absent lawfully importation of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.198" offset="3272182">But if that inference is to be used, well, it's not a statutory inference, it seems to me it's a unitary inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.873" offset="3298826">And while it may be a valid theory of criminal responsibility, and certainty is under the Aider and Abettor Act, it doesn't provide different evidence for each crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.551" offset="3337592">There isn't any evidence that petitioner actually knew because he was there that Barbara Floyd was doing these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.944" offset="3367163">And I think what Justice -- what Judge Learned Hand said in the Peoni case, the basic case before this court decided Nye &amp; Nissen about aiding and abetting is very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.127" offset="3419930">It -- it does seem to be supposed in many cases particularly by the Government that once you show that a man has aided and abetted some part of a criminal transaction, he is held accountable for everything that follows after that.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.372" offset="3468831">But if he maybe held accountable for probable things which he could have reasonably foreseen, contemplated, shared and -- and wanting to happen, it doesn't follow that he was responsible for three different specific things so that they have been separately proven on the basis of the fact that he merely aided and abetted.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.940" offset="3547094">Now, that substance is the first part of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.601" offset="3561827">And the second part of this case is the part of the case which was injected by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.845" offset="3590771">In the Court of Appeals, petitioner argued to the Court a number of points which aren't before this Court now.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.926" offset="3623058">He attacked virtually every count in this indictment, he attacked the charge, he attacked the evidence, he attached the indictment and he attacked the judgment as summing up these other areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.415" offset="3673004">But he didn't contend himself with that, recognizing what the class and rule was, as it's been called in our brief and in the Government's brief, recognizing that the class and rule might intervene in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.067" offset="3723682">He also asked the Court specifically, "If you are going to find less than enough error here to warrant a new trial or an outright reversal, please rule on these counts so I can go back and secure resentencing, if only I can do it a discretionarily under rule 35 if you don't choose to remand it for resentencing."</text>
            <text syncTime="924.794" offset="3802572">But the Court of Appeals did precisely the thing he asked it not to.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.393" offset="3820962">The Court of Appeals said, "The records support some five concurrent sentence counts, we needn't decide whether it supports the consecutive sentences themselves and it cited the Hirabayashi case which stems from the case of United States versus -- Clawson versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.309" offset="3900583">The rule in Clawson versus United States, it's a rule which is set forth on a -- in our brief on page -- pages 37 and 38.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.009" offset="3971427">It's a rule which evidently stems as far as I can gather from some dicta of Lord Mansfield in three cases in the King's Bench Court in the late 18th Century.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.449" offset="4025135">It may also stem from certain other criminal cases in that court, but if so, the House of Lords when it first came to consider the rule didn't believe that they were binding precedents in the respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.676" offset="4050108">The Clawson rule sets that if any one of the counts is good in a multiple count judgment and once the judgment, the presumption of law is that the court awarded sentence on the good count only and it may need not consider the other counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.564" offset="4173615">Now, the Court of Appeals did that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.019" offset="4187408">They said some five concurrent sentence counts are good.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.977" offset="4203290">In other words, they were willing to indulge the assumption that the three counts which Judge Holtzoff had selected for consecutive sentences were no good at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.777" offset="4242474">And then they said, we are firm on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.531" offset="4253445">Now, previously I said we have tentatively agreed that perhaps the majority, not by any stipulation but simply by -- by common reasoning, that the majority, and the Court of Appeals very likely was willing to concede at least for the purposes of decision hypothetically, Judge Bazelon's dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.707" offset="4330245">The respects in which he showed nine counts to be bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.328" offset="4348635">But I don't think it can be assumed at this point that those are the specific counts which the Court of -- Court of Appeals majority found good, the remaining six.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.816" offset="4386670">There isn't anyway as a matter of fact in which petitioner can know really what did happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.973" offset="4407254">But the presumption of the Clawson case is that the trial court awarded sentence on the good count only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.702" offset="4430137">And if the trial court did anything here, it avoided that, it awarded sentence on counts 2, 4 and 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.534" offset="4461484">And counts 4 and 7 are particularly glaring case because they were two deliveries indicted under the same statute arising out of the same sale and the Blockburger single impulse test pretty clearly did say that they were to be treated as one crime only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.796" offset="4526582">So counts 2, 4 and 7 being the specific ones on which the judge awarded the effective sentence, the consecutive sentence are the ones which the Clawson rule would have this Court and the Court of Appeals presume he did not do because some of them are invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.802" offset="4606621">I (Inaudible) was exactly to know how to attack this -- this rule in Clawson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.439" offset="4629086">The Government says that its persistence in the federal courts can't be attributed merely to sheer accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.944" offset="4655104">I think probably some pragmatic explanations of its persistence could be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.361" offset="4676838">One of them might be that normally, people don't plead as petitioner did in the court below for a partial reversal and a remand for resentencing because I suppose most lawyers with a criminal appeal have a certain go-for-broke mentality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.930" offset="4735143">They -- they don't like to demean or seem to detract from their arguments that the case should be reversed outright and a new trial granted or the indictment quashed or somehow mitigated or shared, it was cast on them at least by saying in the next breath but anyway at least send it back for resentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.771" offset="4810480">So I suppose that to some extent that minimizes the number of times in which this rule has ever come up in a square presentation to Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.550" offset="4845589">It recently did come up in the Second Circuit in the case of Haynes versus United States which is cited in our brief, that's at 250 F.2d.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.053" offset="4887594">But by and large, it has been a remarkably persistent rule but by no means a consistent rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.730" offset="4910268">The Court has -- has applied it somewhat discretionarily.</text>

            <text syncTime="1824.052" offset="7399528">The Government will start out this argument today by addressing itself to the question raised by Mr. Justice Whittaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.485" offset="7449266">Needless to say, we have had some difficulty with clarifying the sentence imposed upon the petitioner in this case ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.065" offset="7487613">As this has been indicated, the sentence was imposed upon three counts to run consecutively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.813" offset="7530663">And upon the 12 remaining counts, the sentence was imposed to run concurrently and concurrently with the sentences imposed upon -- the sentence under counts 2, 4 and 7, the consecutive counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.869" offset="7614882">Now, the difficulty I think arises because there is a conflict between what the judge said at the time that he imposed sentence orally and with what is contained in the formal judgment and commitment that he signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.691" offset="7698160">We set -- the formal judgment and commitment is set forth at page 124 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.566" offset="7745599">And it indicates that the judge imposed consecutive times of five years insofar as we are concerned with them, the maximum on counts 2, 4 and 7 and upon counts -- well, the remaining counts five year terms to run concurrently and he said by the counts, top of page 125, and to run concurrently with the sentences imposed on counts 2, 4 and 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.621" offset="7877883">Now, coming down to the bottom of page 125, we have the judge's oral sentence and he says, “William Greene, it is the judgment of this court that on counts 2, 4, 7, you'd be imprisoned in an institution to be designated by the Attorney General for a term of not less than 20 months and not more than five years, and that you'd be fined $500, the sentences to run consecutively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.671" offset="7998046">That on each of the other counts in the indictment, you'd be imprisoned for a term of 20 months to five years and to be fined $500, the sentences on the other counts to run concurrently with the sentences on counts 2, 4 and 7.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.068" offset="8051649">But he didn't stop there, he went on and he said, “In other words, the aggregate sentence is not less than five years and not more than 15 years.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.231" offset="8100342">We believe that that evinces a clear intent of the sentencingjudge to impose an aggregate, a gross or general sentence of 15 years upon the concurrent counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.341" offset="8160737">And if there is a discrepancy between what he said at the time he actually imposed sentence and what was said in the judgment and commitment that was signed, we think it must be resolved in favor of what he said orally because that would seem to express his true intention.</text>

            <text syncTime="3497.554" offset="14093563">And of course, this raises then the question of whether the defendant was properly sentenced to consecutive terms -- I'm sorry, to multiple punishment on several counts involving violations of several different statutes penalizing and prohibiting traffic in narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.630" offset="14205889">Now, the -- to get back to the facts, the -- there was a sale of narcotics made by the petitioner's accomplice on January 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.160" offset="14251969">Counts 4, 5 and 6 were charged for that violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.404" offset="14281017">They involved violations of Section 174, of Title 21, the Export Import Drug Act, Section 4704, of Title 26, the Internal Revenue Code which is the stamp provision, person cannot deal in narcotic drugs expect in or from the stamped package.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.738" offset="14366281">And the count -- the third count of that group charge the violation of the order from the provision of Section 4705.</text>

            <text syncTime="3590.067" offset="14463666">And as I understand the basis for his contention, it is that multiple punishment, cannot be imposed upon violations of three different statutes where the violation arose out of a single transaction, or stated another way that the rule upon which we distinguish between different crimes is one which has to do with whether the evidence is the same to support each of the charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.713" offset="14634193">We contend that the rule is not as petitioner would have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.877" offset="14662928">In fact, if it were, it would seem to lead to rather incongruous results.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.440" offset="14693125">The rule as I think it is -- as it exists and as it should be correctly stated is that two offenses are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.458" offset="14745161">If the statutes against which they offend contain different elements, one statute defines a crime different from another if it has within its definition a legal element different from the elements contained in the other statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="4021.499" offset="16189419">And Blockburger has decided that these offenses were distinct even though the transaction which was involved in the offense consisted of a single one, and we see no occasion for this Court to reconsider the merits of the question involved in the Gore decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="4134.903" offset="16643009">That is the statutory rule, Government does not disagree with it, we say however that it cannot be applied in this case in view of the clear indication on the part of Congress down through the years to impose more and more severe sentences upon narcotics violators.</text>

            <text syncTime="5310.107" offset="21343796">Now, I take it this Court has moved to a more specific question that there may, as a matter of fact, be an actually illegal sentence if we can find out what part of this is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="5320.843" offset="21386742">I think this -- I think that the construction that Justice Whittaker is inclined to and the construction which footnote 8 suggest is the proper construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5330.534" offset="21425507">I don't see how this can be considered a gross sentence, and I don't see how the Court of Appeals can be said to have considered a gross sentence when they use the word aggregate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5338.476" offset="21457272">Now, words may maybe fuzzy in points but aggregate seems to me to mean the sum of things, whereas gross sentences traditionally, a term implied -- used when you impose a single sentence for all of the counts put together.</text>
            <text syncTime="5353.807" offset="21518608">This was the Clawson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5355.631" offset="21525922">There was one sentence implied on -- imposed on five counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5361.735" offset="21550268">Now, I don't think that's -- it's a permissible construction of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5365.006" offset="21563434">Now, if that's not true, then of course this must go back and I think the Court of Appeals must pass -- unless this Court can't and I don't think the case is in their posture either, must pass upon the validity of these consecutive sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="5378.462" offset="21617246">Now, I'm at sea, I'm not as familiar as Justice Whittaker and as other people in the (Inaudible) field with what these concurrent sentences do.</text>
            <text syncTime="5385.549" offset="21645563">I think the Court of Appeals felt that they were free to plug one in at count 2 and one in at count 4 and one in at count 7, but evidently I think grammatically, Justice Whittaker is right, that they are not free to do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="5417.166" offset="21771995">I -- I don't see how the Government can come to this Court and say there is this possibility or this is a criminal case, it's a very distinct possibility, the Court of Appeals doesn't really settle it for us, but we'll simply argue to you that the possibility, if it does exist should be ignored or disfavored.</text>
            <text syncTime="5435.694" offset="21846183">But if the possibility does exist, the Government says, then of course, the case has got to go back.But it seems to me that's the function of appellate review and that's what I have to bicker with the Clawson case even if it doesn't rule it -- even if it doesn't govern this case.</text>
