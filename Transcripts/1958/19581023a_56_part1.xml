            <label>Mr. Lawrence J. Mahoney</label>
            <text syncTime="45.039" offset="283564">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.531" offset="293491">We have four separate grounds of appeal here and so I will give you the facts as briefly as possible in order to have enough time to touch on each.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.600" offset="325778">Now, this action was started by the administratrix of the decedent Walter Halecki in the Southern District of New York alleging diversity of citizenship and was based entirely upon the wrongful death statute of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.899" offset="387009">The complaint alleged in substance negligence on the part of the defendant which was the pilot association that owned a boat called the pilot boat New Jersey and also alleged unseaworthiness of that pilot boat.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.557" offset="441553">Now, the facts briefly were these.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.506" offset="449390">In September of 1951, this pilot boat was turned over to a repair yard in New Jersey called Rodermond Repair Yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.209" offset="484185">The boat was there for a period of several weeks undergoing annual overhauling and repairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.471" offset="513233">The nature of the repairs was varied.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.515" offset="521383">As a matter of fact, some of the crews stayed on the boat, some of them took part in some of the less substantial repairs such as painting and shipping.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.533" offset="561507">The boat was tied up with a pier.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.359" offset="568822">There's no question it was in navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.762" offset="578435">However, the boat was, during its period in the repair yard, a dead ship, that is, there was no power aboard.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.942" offset="603094">Any power that was used or equipment and repair came from Rodermond Repair Yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.149" offset="627963">Now, some of the work could be done included electrical repairs and Rodermond wasn't equipped to perform those repairs so they subcontracted the electrical work to a company called K. &amp; S. Electrical Company, also a Jersey corporation and the employer of the decedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.382" offset="700897">Neither Rodermond nor K. &amp; S. were parties to this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.959" offset="719182">The decedent was a shore-side electrician.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.196" offset="728168">Most of his work was done at shore and pursuant to orders received from his employer K. &amp; S., he and a fellow worker by the name of Doidge, also an electrician, came aboard the pilot boat on the day before they were to do the work in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.455" offset="797236">The particular item of work that we are interested in today was cleaning the generators on the pilot boat.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.418" offset="825031">Necessarily the power had to be ought to do that work because the generators supply the power of the boat.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.079" offset="851675">The way the work was to be done was to spray these generators with a solvent called carbon tetrachloride to dissolve the grease on the generator.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.343" offset="892740">The record discloses that this was the customary method when the -- the decedent and its co-worker Doidge had customarily used and had done many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.062" offset="935581">Now, carbon tetrachloride was admittedly a dangerous substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.932" offset="951150">It was known to be such by the decedent and its co-worker, dangerous that is if inhaled to a substantial amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.869" offset="982810">Therefore, the ventilation system of the boat itself which consisted in the usual vents and blowers which were designed to take the fumes out of the engine room were supplemented or automated by various pieces of portable equipment, none of which belonged to the boat.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.337" offset="1052714">They all either were property of the repair yard or a property of K. &amp; S. Electrical Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.249" offset="1076328">Very briefly, the day before the decedent Halecki and Doidge came in and assemble this equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.612" offset="1101824">They put blowers and air hoses and portable fans, various devices to supplement the ship's equipment which was manifestly not designed to take out carbon tetrachloride which was heavier than air substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.889" offset="1162951">Briefly stated on, Saturday it was, they came aboard expressly then because no crewmen were around, no repair yard workers were present.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.037" offset="1195551">It was admittedly dangerous work.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.980" offset="1207254">The only person present in addition to the two electricians Halecki and Doidge was a watchman employed by the defendant and he admittedly had nothing to do with the work, he didn't take part in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.433" offset="1253125">As a matter of fact, they told him to leave because it was dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.856" offset="1270784">One of the pieces of equipment which they used were gas masks which belonged to K. &amp; S. Electrical Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.700" offset="1298160">I wish to emphasize that this work was entirely done in the discretion of the two electricians, the manner in which they did it was up to themselves, the time of which was up to themselves, there was no supervision, no orders from anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.438" offset="1357093">The work proceeded for several hours without a vent, a boatman took part in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.437" offset="1377155">However, Doidge, because he had a sore arm, didn't do very much with the spraying, Halecki himself did most of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.948" offset="1403173">Very briefly, it consisted of spraying this carbon tetrachloride, a liquid, out-of-tank by means of an air hose and it will blows around to blow the fumes away.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.042" offset="1447581">At the completion of the work Mr. Doidge said that -- Mr. Halecki said that he didn't feel very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.210" offset="1468165">A few days later he took sick, he was hospitalized, two weeks later he died.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.439" offset="1489168">The hospital record which was put into evidence by the plaintiff disclosed that the cause of his death was carbon tetrachloride poisoning and that fact is not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.223" offset="1532217">However, the record also disclosed that the decedent had consumed for a period of five months prior to his death a half a pint of whiskey a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.074" offset="1567640">The significance of that fact I will mention in a few moments.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.443" offset="1581119">The main factual issue with the trial was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.265" offset="1592404">The plaintiff contended that the cause of the death was inadequate ventilation system on the pilot boat New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.673" offset="1622079">They said there was a dangerous condition there, that the decedent was exposed to an improper or dangerous concentration of carbon tetrachloride.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.085" offset="1663666">The defendant, on the other hand, introduced the testimony of Dr. Milton Helpern, a New York State medical examiner and a leading toxicologist, who testified that a person who consumed a large amount of alcohol was susceptible to a very small exposure, an exposure far less than the usual permissive percentage.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.206" offset="1748198">So small perhaps he cited an incident where a person using carbon at a household preparation could be severely injured if he had alcohol in his system.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.776" offset="1786441">At any rate, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff in the sum of $65,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.912" offset="1810996">The verdict was upheld by the Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.933" offset="1823117">Now, there are four grounds for this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.922" offset="1839104">First that the decedent's -- that the plaintiff's action pursuant to the Wrongful Death Act of New Jersey, the sought of her right, should be determined by the state rule contributory negligence and not by the maritime rule of comparative negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.309" offset="1908590">The second ground, it was contended by the defendant that in any event, the Wrongful Death Act of New Jersey applied only to negligence and was not broad enough to encompass unseaworthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.446" offset="1957177">Thirdly, the defendant contended quite apart from the previous ground that the decedent, by the nature of his employment, was not entitled to an unseaworthy vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.249" offset="2000332">He wasn't one of the persons to whom the warranty extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.736" offset="2014333">And finally, the defendant contended that there was insufficiency that it had never been proved that a dangerous condition existed aboard the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.641" offset="2077968">Now, addressing myself first to the question of contributory negligence.</text>

            <text syncTime="569.991" offset="2383287">Now the first point is that there's no question I think, it's not disputed that the general maritime law had no remedy for wrongful death.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.333" offset="2420694">And therefore, claimants in a situation like Halecki found himself are required to look to the state statute and the honorary courts had approved such a procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="973.271" offset="3996505">Well, my very next point deals exactly with that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.539" offset="4009566">The reason it comes up is this, that in the Circuit Court, the majority of opinion in Halecki agreed that before the Pope &amp; Talbot against Hawn case that contributory negligence would have been the rule but Mr., rather Judge Learned Hand read the Pope &amp; Talbot v. Hawn case to change the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.865" offset="4094830">And here, we -- I think we -- it comes to the issue which Your Honor has raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.564" offset="4117608">Hawn was an injured but living plaintiff and his right without question originated in the maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.561" offset="4153657">However, he didn't have to rely on the state law as Halecki did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.449" offset="4173197">He had his own rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.308" offset="4180616">His rights were correctly measured by the maritime rule of comparative negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.096" offset="4199737">However, the rights are completely different not only in origin but in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.315" offset="4232652">A -- a living plaintiff has a right to recover for his own damages most primarily that of pain and suffering, medical expenses, and his lost income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.474" offset="4277269">His dependents however on his death have an entirely different item of damage, an entirely different right which didn't exist either in maritime law or the common law and that is to recover for their lost not the decedent's lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.809" offset="4338604">Their own lost that is anticipated due to income occasioned by the death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.049" offset="4359607">Now, the fact that -- that there is such an extreme difference is demonstrated by the existence in New Jersey as in other places of two separate statutes, the Wrongful Death Act which we have here and the survival statute which doesn't create a new right in the defendant but preserves the right that this decedent had prior to his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.393" offset="4448946">In other words, under survival statute an state can recover for the pain and suffering he -- he suffered before he died.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.937" offset="4479143">They can recover for his medical expenses, but that's not the statute we have before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.013" offset="4499414">Now, the respondent has raised exactly Your Honor's argument in what they have termed the such as wood argument, the language of the statute says in effect that an act such as wood have given rights to an action if the man had lived, she will give his defendants a cause of action and the wrongful death statute and the defendant has argued also that it's incongruous to say if the man had lived that he would have had a right to -- would narrow it to say comparative negligence but then if he died his family should be circumscribed by a liable contributory negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.927" offset="4647058">However, bearing in mind that these rights are completely distinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.265" offset="4668479">It -- it is not only incongruous but it's -- it's inescapable.</text>
