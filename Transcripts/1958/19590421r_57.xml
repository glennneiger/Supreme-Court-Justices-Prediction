            <text syncTime="110.690" offset="546147">The point that I want to bring out today, in addition to the argument I made before this Court in December, is the fact that while there may be exceptions of that, while any public official in making a report to his superior may have a certain amount of privileges.</text>

            <text syncTime="324.108" offset="1399829">Now, Judge Coleman wrote his opinion in that case in which he report -- he held that the report of the superior in -- which included certain information, which ordinarily would be libelous was pertinent to the issue involved and pertinent to the proper report issues that's been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.458" offset="1505155">However, they didn't quote this from his opinion, in which he said that -- in which he determined the immunity of the officer laid down the following rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="381.659" offset="1630020">Judge Coleman said, “This inquiry is very essential and absolute privilege should not be allowed to extend to any irrelevant statement performed under the guise of official duty.”</text>

            <text syncTime="433.953" offset="1839208">Now, I -- I say this that as -- as Coleman said -- and that Judge Coleman said there is a very definite distinction between granting an absolute privilege to all government officials of whatever kind and granting on those -- only to those in the major executive branches of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.422" offset="1921024">Just as I have indicated that they might be the head of the -- or in the department.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.222" offset="1944221">Now, we go to a second case that they cite in support of their -- of their there.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.700" offset="1978180">It's the case of Harwood v. McMurtry, which is cited also on page 20 of their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.154" offset="2007960">In that case, the District Court said that when an officer departs from official duty and indulges in defamatory statements wholly irrelevant and foreign to his scope is not entitled to protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.456" offset="2085177">The Court went on to say that the seriousness of affording such protection under the cover of which the officers of the Government under guise of official duty may make a false and a malicious statement something and now -- subjecting another to scorn and ridicule with the ensuing damages without the injured party being able to secure a legal address cannot be doubted.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.583" offset="2201684">Now, also, there are a number of decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.611" offset="2221850">This point was raised in our brief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.913" offset="2266990">On page 10 of the brief, a captain -- the report of the petitioner was neither fair nor reasonable and was fairly malicious being liable as perceived.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.902" offset="2342954">Now, what I want to get at in this case, that regardless of whether or not the Government says that this was all his privilege that the petitioner in this case lost his privilege by putting extraneous remarks in the communication which he released to the public press and which he released to the members of Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="602.236" offset="2512332">Now, are you making that argument on the assumption that there were some things given in the press release in the other statement that it was his duty to give out?</text>

            <text syncTime="1591.555" offset="6469569">The appellant was attorney at law and sued for damages allegedly he was liable for reasons that the allegation contained in the complaint filed or set aside an order of settlement and discontinuous of an action wherein he was named as a defendant -- was discontinuous was entered December 24, 1924 in a cause -- involving the appellee (Inaudible).</text>

            <text syncTime="1628.182" offset="6616064">The basis of the suit was to set aside the discontinuous as it was it -- issued duress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.837" offset="6646680">The suit was compromised and discontinued or the litigation or the disposition of one's estate of a William E. Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.926" offset="6687117">It was claimed that Smith was induced for fraud and forced to marry one, Clare Smith that he was in impaired mental condition that he executed the last will and testament which was obtained by fraud and undue influence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.698" offset="6750124">And these conveyances and assignments were made which were also fraudulent and the suit sought to enjoin them, defendants think therein named from transferring, conveying, or otherwise disposing other property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.961" offset="6807176">The 20th paragraph of the complaint read, that the said settlement, the plaintiff has obtained evidence of the said settlement which leads them to believe, and she has an information belief that the death of the said William E. Smith was brought about by the defendants pursuant to their fraudulent plan and -- and conspiracy here and about set forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="1710.326" offset="6944684">First, testing the sufficiency of the complaint the appellees are deemed to have conceded the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.460" offset="6977181">The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit stated that the allegations are libelous and (Inaudible) and unless they are privileged, they in effect charge the plaintiff with crimes that cancel our privilege in respect to such statements, were all written and made in judicial proceedings and pertinent thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.449" offset="7073207">In England, they hold that the immunity is much broader than it is in the American Courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1808.594" offset="7337775">There are a number of other cases in which the privilege of a -- an attorney has been lost by irrelevant matters stated in pleadings or in motions there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.836" offset="7394722">And I am contending in this case by including in this release with the fact that he's charge these men with overt subversiveness on which it was held according to the Court of Appeals of the -- of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.478" offset="7541321">It was held -- shows that that it was -- overthrow the United States Government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.776" offset="7582490">That case came up in a question of the Communist Party of New York brought an action to set aside a statute in that State on the grounds that it was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.387" offset="7648946">The statute provided among other things that if that no one is a member of an organization which was subversive could -- could have any right to have a teacher's position in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.446" offset="7733164">The Court of Appeals held in that case that the organization who brought the action was not subversive, because they did not advocate the overthrow of the Government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.184" offset="7804113">Now, in this case, I don't know how much time I have left, but I would just want to say this, that I'm a little bit amazed that a Department of Justice dedicated to liberty, injustice, and the right for all that would come before this Court and ask this Court to make a decision or make a decision to the effect that hundreds and even thousands that we take -- there'd be hundreds of captains, but there'd be others in the Army and the air forces could have the same rank as the petitioner in this case, that if you would have absolute authority to say anything that you wanted to about anyone else so long as you made it in official report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.064" offset="8099610">Your Honors, that is not the law as I find it that they all -- that it has to be pertinent to the issues involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.562" offset="8141615">If Your Honors adopt such a rule as that, what happens?</text>

            <text syncTime="2029.854" offset="8222804">Now, the -- in this case, the petitioner, by including in there this libelous charge which is libelous per se in charging these men with overt subversiveness certainly lost any privilege he had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.558" offset="8313605">And I also have the other authorities, which is contained in my brief to -- to that effect and I'm not going to repeat them here because they are in the brief.</text>
