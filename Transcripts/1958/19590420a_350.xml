            <text syncTime="8.546" offset="137592">Mr. Friedman, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="10.538" offset="145533">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.810" offset="158595">The basic issue presented by this case and by the case which immediately follows it is whether government executive officials below the rank of cabinet officer have an absolute immunity for alleged defamatory statements made in the course of their official duties relating to matters over which they have supervision and control.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.231" offset="248247">In this case, the alleged libel consisted of a press release issued by the head of an independent agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.599" offset="277817">In the case which follows it, it involved the transmission by a high naval official, two members of Congress, of copies of a report which he had made to his superiors in the course of his official duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.954" offset="331212">In each case, the Court of Appeals by a divided court, held that the defamatory statement was not absolutely privileged but only subjected to a qualified privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.791" offset="374575">That is a privilege, which could be -- could be lost by showing that the statement was malicious or that it went beyond what was necessary under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.106" offset="411773">Now, prior to discussing the facts in this case, I'd like to indicate briefly to the Court the policy considerations which underlie the rule of absolute immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.101" offset="459734">I believe that is important because when you deal with a case of this type, one might tend to instinctively react and say, “Well, if a government official maliciously defamed someone, why shouldn't he be held responsible in damages?”</text>
            <text syncTime="104.019" offset="519398">And I think the answer to that was put most eloquently by Judge Learned Hand in the celebrated case of Gregoire against Biddle in which he held there was an absolute privilege governing the performance of official duties by the judicial officers of the Government in a proceeding involving an alleged improper retention in custody of an enemy alien.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="126.514" stopTime="127.981">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="126.514" offset="609468">That is not a libel case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="127.981" stopTime="401.956">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="127.981" offset="615320">No, Mr. Justice, but we believe that the principles that are involved are equally applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.246" offset="636322">Now, I'd like us to read briefly two or three sentences to the court in Judge Hand's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.316" offset="656593">He starts by saying, “It does indeed go without saying that an official, who is in fact guilty of using his powers to vent his spleen upon others, or for any other personal motive not connected with the public good, should not escape liability for the injuries he may so cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.480" offset="733288">And, if it were possible in practice to confine such complaints to the guilty, it would be monstrous to deny recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.884" offset="766934">The justification for doing so is that it is impossible to know whether the claim is well founded until the case has been tried, and that to submit all officials, the innocent as well as the guilty, to the burden of a trial and to the inevitable danger of its outcome, would dampen the ardor of all but the most resolute, or the most irresponsible, in the unflinching discharge of their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.984" offset="859303">Again and again the public interest calls for action which may turn out to be founded on a mistake, in the face of which an official may later find himself hard put to it to satisfy a jury of his good faith.”</text>
            <text syncTime="201.049" offset="907577">And then Judge Hand concludes this, says, “As is so often the case, the answer must be found in a balance between the evils inevitable in either alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.489" offset="941328">In this instance it has been thought in the end better to leave unredressed the wrongs done by dishonest officers than to subject those who try to do their duty to the constant dread of retaliation."</text>
            <text syncTime="223.234" offset="996289">In other words, this policy that is sort to be protected by the doctrine of absolute privilege is a recognition that public officials may be hesitant to do their duty freely and resolutely if they know that at some future date, they may be required to come before a jury and satisfy the jury of their good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.049" offset="1095555">That they acted properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.808" offset="1102555">That they did not exceed what was necessary under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.382" offset="1116871">It's very easy in one of these cases and it's true in most of these defamation cases for the plaintiff to allege that the defendant did this maliciously.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.825" offset="1150621">That he did it with the intention to injure the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.041" offset="1163577">This puts the government official in the position of having to be certain that at some future date, he will be able to satisfy the jury of his good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.015" offset="1203388">Now, if that is the rule and that is the rule in effect of qualified privilege, what this means as Judge Hand pointed out is that if you've got a case where even though the public interest would call for government action, an official will be reluctant to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.765" offset="1266395">He will be reluctant to act because at some future date, he may find it necessary to litigate, two years hence, one year hence, the bona fides of which he acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.312" offset="1316655">Now, we think this consideration is particularly important in the area involved in these cases which is the furnishing of information to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.576" offset="1357720">Today, the issuance of press releases is a vital and necessary part of the language our Government operates.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.999" offset="1383320">That's frequently the only way in which adequate information may be given to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.074" offset="1407666">We've heard recently a great deal of concern with the fact that government officials have been withholding information which the public is entitled to, the emphasis on the public right to know.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.524" offset="1453432">Well, from the point of view of the public's right to know, we think that damage could equally be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.694" offset="1474121">If government officials hesitate to make information public, which they think the performance of their duties requires them to make public because of the threat of this possible litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.760" offset="1522395">And the doctrine of absolute privilege is designed to protect this interest by blocking off at the inception these litigation suits to make it clear that if he doesn't -- the official does not have to go in and litigate these particular issues at great time, at great expense and the fear that he may ultimately be held liable for something which is within, he believed, necessary in the case to protect the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.936" offset="1627094">Now, I want to emphasize that this is one of those situations where the particular act involved, the particular statement issued must be weighed on the other hand against the broader, public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.606" offset="1681847">Now, with this, by way of background, I'd like to come to the particular defamation involved in this litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="408.016" offset="1735450">Is it necessary to restrain the officer from saying the things in his official conduct and doing the things that he is required to do on the one hand and on the other hand calling the press in and -- and giving a press release that might be defamatory on the -- and be actuated by malice?</text>
            <text syncTime="436.916" offset="1851016">Could he not give the information through his official acts and -- and leave the press conferences to -- to other considerations that were in no sense defamatory?</text>

            <text syncTime="449.526" offset="1901484">I think, Mr. Chief Justice, the answer to that question is that in this area, the giving out press releases and the making of this information available to the public is an essential part of a government official's duty that one of the important things and such a program is Rent Stabilization is getting before the public.</text>

            <text syncTime="786.082" offset="3247731">That had happened in 1950, a terminal-leave plan for using up certain terminal-leave had taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.347" offset="3276779">At the time, this terminal-leave took place, the petitioner was the deputy director of that agency and he opposed the plans strongly and it was recognized by the respondents in this case that he had opposed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.995" offset="3335398">But this opposition did not prevail and the plan was effectuated for 49 of the employees of that agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.878" offset="3366849">Almost three years later, the Office of Rent Stabilization received a request from Senator Williams for some information with respect to this terminal-leave plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.178" offset="3416064">And the respondent, Mr. Madigan, who is the Director of Administration of the agency prepared a letter for petitioner's signature setting forth the facts with respect to this plan and in petitioner's view, this letter supported the plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="856.451" offset="3529226">The following day, Senator Williams made a speech on the floor of the Senate in which he bitterly attacked this terminal-leave plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.863" offset="3570813">Three other senators joined with him in this attack and it was suggested that the matter which should be investigated by the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.558" offset="3597563">These payments were described as a conspiracy to defraud the Government and as a raid on the treasury.</text>

            <text syncTime="885.156" offset="3643956">That speech took place on Wednesday.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.931" offset="3659107">The press release was issued the next day on Thursday and at that time, petitioner called in these two people involved and tells them that as a result of the adverse criticism of the agency, he was going to suspend them as a disciplinary measure and at the same time he issued a press release.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.779" offset="3738520">That the issuance of the press release is as I've stated was a normal practice in the agency at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1008.533" offset="4137462">And in considering the press release, I think it's very important to remember that this followed by one day these speeches on the floor of the Senate which had gotten wide publicity and which necessarily would hold the agency up to public criticism and scorn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.332" offset="4212694">People would think that this is one of those government agencies where people were engaging in a regular practice as an -- we believe that he was fully justified in issuing this press release in the circumstances in order to regain public confidence in the agency and for him to make it clear that he did not condone this plan which had been criticized and that he was taking disciplinary action against the persons responsible for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.123" offset="4307884">The libel action was filed shortly after the issuance of the press release.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.928" offset="4327111">The District Court rejected the contention of Mr. Barr that it was absolutely privileged, held that it was not even covered by a qualified privilege and sent the case to the jury solely on the question of whether one, the publication was defamatory and two, if it was, whether the -- plaintiffs were entitled to punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.750" offset="4410389">The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $6500 and $2000 respectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.958" offset="4443199">The Government appealed to the Court of Appeals rather Mr. Barr appealed, the Government was representing him as counsel in the case and raised at -- in that stage of the case only the question of absolute privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.821" offset="4502653">The District Court by a divided court sustained the ruling of the District Court that there was no -- there was no absolute privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.637" offset="4541942">The court reasoned as follows - it said that the defendant's decision to suspend the plaintiffs and his execution of any documents appropriate to that end were probably within his general line of duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.244" offset="4592306">And if so, if he had written a letter to his superior explaining what he was doing, that would have been within his line of duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.874" offset="4622817">However, the court went on, in explaining his decision to the general public, the defendant went entirely outside his line of duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.584" offset="4661687">And then the court suggested that if in this case, the defendant had been a cabinet officer, the public explanation might have been absolutely privileged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.762" offset="4694392">However, it went on and said they didn't have to reach the question whether the public explanation of the head of an independent agency such as the Atomic Energy Commission or the director of the parent agency, the Economic Stabilization Agency would be entitled to a qualified privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.009" offset="4763460">They said they didn't have to reach that situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1466.240" offset="5968332">But that principle, the principle of Spalding against Vilas has been extended by the Court of Appeals in two cases to cover press releases by cabinet officers in both Glass against Ickes and Mellon against Brewer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.942" offset="6027160">And those cases recognized that the cabinet officer, at least, was absolutely privileged in issuing a press release relating to matters generally committed to his supervision and control even though he was not specifically authorized or requested to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.227" offset="6092257">In other words, it doesn't make any difference in the basic theory whether the government official is specifically directed to do something or whether he does it within the broad framework of his power as long as he remains within that broad framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.344" offset="6152756">Now, we think the Court of Appeals, in this case, when it said that the petitioner went outside his line of duty in issuing the press release has drawn an unduly narrow standard because what constitutes the line of duty necessarily has to vary with the particular individual involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.815" offset="6238647">In the case of a man of this position, who was the head of an agency, we think that his line of duty, as that phrase is used by the Court, necessarily includes the taking of whatever steps are necessary to obtain adequate publicity for the work of his agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.617" offset="6305834">And here, this agency had been subjected to very serious criticism and we think he was fully warranted in the circumstances in issuing a press release explaining that he did not condone this plan and that he was taking disciplinary proceedings against the author of that plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.866" offset="6390888">And I don't put it a little differently that when you redeal with an official of this rank but just as in the case of the cabinet officer, his line of duty is not limited to things which he is specifically charged with doing in the sense that there's a regulation directing him to do it but broadly covers all acts having more of a less connection with the general matters committed by law to his supervision of -- and control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.248" offset="6496319">And I want to again emphasize that a rule which would require a high government official to litigate his good faith in the issuance of a press release would inevitably result and that people of this level would hesitate if they had any doubt as to whether this might subsequently be misconstrued as to whether it could be argued if they were malicious, they'd be conservative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.999" offset="6595375">They would hesitate to put out information to the public even though they believe that the public should have this information and even though, equally important from the other side of the fence, the public should have the right to this information.</text>

            <text syncTime="4965.765" offset="19966412">Mr. Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4969.280" offset="19980518">In considering the policy issue here, my opponent has suggested that no public official has any need maliciously to defame citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="4981.381" offset="20028897">Well, of course, nobody is suggesting that it's necessary to give the public official the right to defame citizens in order that he may do his duties fearlessly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4992.540" offset="20073514">But we are contending if that in order to his duty fearlessly, it is necessary that he have the right to take such steps as he deems proper without fear that in some particular case he may be challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="5007.066" offset="20131610">I think the policy -- the basic theory of the policy is that you don't look to the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5013.210" offset="20156165">It's a broad policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5014.919" offset="20163062">You try to protect the interest of the people as a whole and having their government officials carry on their functions as they deem necessary for their important offices to make the fullest amount of information available to the people and because in a particular case, it is alleged that a particular official in carrying out his acts, acted maliciously, acted out of base motives.</text>
            <text syncTime="5039.857" offset="20262849">That is no reason to destroy the privilege and to say that the Court in this particular case, the action is improper, therefore, we're going to say that all government officials in this situation must stand up at some future date before a jury and attempt to prove their good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="5059.805" offset="20342575">Now, three things that I'd like to answer, specifically, that Mr. Scott suggested with respect to the power of Mr. Barr as the head of this agency, the fact he conceded that Mr. Barr had the power to suspend and fire his employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="5076.922" offset="20411016">In fact, that the employees had the right of appeal to a higher agency, it seems to me, does not mean that he cannot be deemed to have the control over these agencies which establishes him as the head of an important agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="5092.280" offset="20472456">We also like to answer the question which Mr. Justice Whittaker asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="5097.042" offset="20491577">We disagree, most emphatically, with Mr. Scott that the test is rank.</text>
            <text syncTime="5101.958" offset="20511222">We think that's an artificial test.</text>
            <text syncTime="5103.715" offset="20518222">We think it has to be the function which the official performs because depending on a particular area of Government involved, in one case, a cabinet officer maybe performing certain functions, in another situation, a man of a lower rank may be performing just as important functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5121.993" offset="20591365">And the way the executive departments of the Government are operating today, it's pretty clear that the cabinet officer himself cannot hope to perform all of the important policy functions in Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5135.117" offset="20643819">We think it would be unrealistic to draw the line of the level of the cabinet officer and say, “That's as far as it goes, that in effect we'll be saying that only cabinet officers are performing so important functions as to require that they be given this immunity.”</text>
