          <heading>Argument of Edward S. Greenbaum</heading>
          <turn speaker="edward_s_greenbaum" startTime="0.000" stopTime="293.420">
            <label>Mr. Edward S. Greenbaum</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">-- this was required to run in North Dakota, I understood your question was how many votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.417" offset="153057">There is no primary at this filing of a petition there.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.606" offset="169775">And I could say I haven't done well and I have a little trouble hearing so I apologize for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.563" offset="193599">As we were indicating a moment ago the situation in this case is that in 1927, this statute was passed and this is the first time nearly a third of a century that this case has come before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.068" offset="267682">The act at that time when the statute was passed had no such thing as television, radio we might say just been born, television had been conceived but wasn't born and then the intervening period of time we've had various cases that have come up.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.617" offset="337795">And just very briefly to give the Court a picture of what's happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.428" offset="353050">The statutes that are quoted in our brief on pages 2 and 3 and pages 2, it's the statute 315 which is presently before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.593" offset="397772">The big purpose of this statute was of course to give equal time to the opposing candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.466" offset="425253">A new concept had entered into the American field and as Mr. Justice Frankfurter said for this Court in the case of NBC against FCC, we had a unique situation where the time was limited, and therefore for the first time and as far as I can see in our history we did have a need and rightly so for control.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.194" offset="532146">So 315 sir in the early days there that if any licensee shall permit a political opponent to have the right to use of the station, the other time, the other candidate must be granted equal time and that is the question before us now, that -- into that statute has been read the provision that the equal time allows immunity to the station.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.532" offset="669550">It is our contention that what Congress was saying was, you do not have to give equal time to anybody but if you do then you must let the opponent or in this case the opponents have equal opportunities to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.082" offset="751679">At the same time the statute contained two other provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.149" offset="764008">You will notice on page 2 of our brief that proviso provided that such licensee shall have no power censorship over the material broadcast.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.030" offset="811447">And on the following page, page 3, it is stated in the Section 326 at the top of the page that nothing in the act shall interfere with -- I am sorry, 414 that nothing in the act shall in anyway abridge or alter the remedies now existing either at common law or by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.346" offset="904756">The fact is, if the Court please, that in spite of these provisions, the court in South Dakota has granted immunity to the television station and has said that there is no responsibility on its part.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.639" offset="965883">It is our contention going back to the question that Mr. Justice Black indicated before lunch that whether or not Congress could have done this, whether it had the statutory power and as our opponents say it could have done it by the stroke of the pen, the fact is that it never took that stroke of that pen.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.623" offset="1041847">Indeed when the first section was passed by the United States Senate, I am talking now of 315, it did include an immunity provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.284" offset="1092524">There was considerable debate about that in the Senate and then in conference it was stricken out.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.791" offset="1118542">And since that time 16 different times, Congress has been asked to and 16 different times Congress has refused to grant this immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.006" offset="1167444">Very briefly the history of the section and what's happened on it since then is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.246" offset="1196387">In 1932, that's the period of five years the first case arose, this in Nebraska, the case was Sorenson against Wood and that court held that there is no immunity there and therefore it held in favor of the plaintiff and held the television station libel.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="293.420" stopTime="296.983">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="293.420" offset="1277053">Immunity under the Federal statute or immunity under the state law?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edward_s_greenbaum" startTime="296.983" stopTime="589.514">
            <label>Mr. Edward S. Greenbaum</label>
            <text syncTime="296.983" offset="1291264">It would always be under the state law Your Honor but as far as we can see the argument presently made, one of the arguments is that the federal statute gives what is called, if I may use the language there, a federal immunity which means the federal -- and as the field of libel which of course is definitely a state function and by entering that field, immunity is granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.148" offset="1391992">So I am unable to answer your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.109" offset="1399829">I leave better than by saying immunity is granted under the federal statute of 315.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.119" offset="1431803">In other words, the state law has been infringed upon by the Congress on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.550" offset="1457612">Things went along, what I would call, rather quietly on this particular front to 1932 till, when the Sorenson case was decided, till 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.193" offset="1504110">In fact we could add the prior five years to that and say from '37 to '48 a period of 21 years when this question was more or less quiet.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.477" offset="1561266">Then in 1948 after the commission, Federal Communications Commission held that case to two-and-a-half years, it decided that the statute of 315 granted not only immunity, but deferred and prevented the stations from deleting or excluding exercising libelous matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.316" offset="1656665">That case arose in connection with a station that was up, for its three year renewal license.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.043" offset="1683519">As we indicated before every three years a station has to ask for permission to go on.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.418" offset="1713089">The station was rather forcibly we might say slapped on the wrist due to the fact that the station in a campaign before had refused to give political campaign time to any candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.111" offset="1771813">So we might say and completely over to dicta if you can use that expression for the commission, it granted a renewal even though it scolded the station and said two important things, the station is not permitted to delete a libel, and two it said the station is granted immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.004" offset="1863346">I don't think it would take the commission two-and-a-half years to decide that case, but it was a very split decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.969" offset="1895215">The dissenting commissioner Jones called the decision unnecessary and he also said the language about immunity was extremely dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.695" offset="1942131">He said and predicted that unscrupulous candidates could use this statute as thus construed as a weapon to bait labor and capital and dispense subversive division in the southern states, he didn't say the southern states, and elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.111" offset="2019767">A few decades later after this case came up, there was an action brought by another station in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.713" offset="2054248">The question there was as to whether or not the FCC could be restrained from enforcing this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.902" offset="2086954">The FCC, if I may use the expression, turned turtle and ran away from its own decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.327" offset="2112658">It said that it wasn't any official ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.221" offset="2128227">This was an interpretation in an opinion that was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.248" offset="2144319">And the Supreme Court in Houston, Texas said that it had no jurisdiction in the case, no power in the case because the ruling of the FCC was as the commission itself said not a binding ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.227" offset="2200325">Very shortly after I believe, a few days after, the Houston Post case the question came before Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.984" offset="2231359">There was appointed a special committee to investigate the Federal Communications Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.156" offset="2256018">At that time the chairman of FCC was Mr. Wayne Coy who also ran away from this decision on the Port Huron case before the Congressional Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.779" offset="2306487">He said that no one will have any trouble who denies a candidate the right to what anyone would hold debate a defamatory statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.264" offset="2356433">Congress then reported or this committee of congress reported to the Congress that FCC is not planning to enforce this and the whole matter should be looked into further, 1948 that was.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.119" offset="2419858">Things went along, I can't say this time rather quietly a little bit hectically, until 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.217" offset="2448280">Then in the case of WDSU --</text>

            <text syncTime="647.997" offset="2695398">I might say deeply concerned in the light of this Port Huron case that some broadcasters may fear the loss of their licenses if they deny a candidate the right to make what anyone would construe is a libelous statement and he asks for assurance that, that would be done and as you will see on the top of 17 the assurance came from the Chairman Mr. Coy and the report to Congress indicated Mr. Justice Frankfurter that they did have a feeling, not only a feeling, the assurance that no immediate action would be taken.</text>

            <text syncTime="1134.023" offset="4639431">Well I may put it this way, that the very attitude of this station indicates what will be the future of this whole tremendously broad program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.528" offset="4685511">Here you have a medium, first radio and now television which means it can reach as you all know many millions, in the last year speech of President Roosevelt was said to have reached a limit of over 60 million people at one time, this vast powerful huge medium is now placed from the position whereby the irresponsible person, the speaker was worthless, who has no interest in any financial responsibility is given the absolute right to get on this radio, get on this television, as this defendant did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.079" offset="4855724">Now the defendant I mean the individual defendant Townley who was sued, as well as the radio station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.040" offset="4883519">What he does in this case, he virtually walks into the station and he says I want to be -- the speech televised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.832" offset="4914657">The station says this is libel and we can't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.361" offset="4932838">He says, “I am candidate for others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.855" offset="4942764">I have my 300 signatures and I am entitled to have my rights protected under 315.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.463" offset="4969200">So he said that all he can do is – he sits there, gets himself photographed, has himself put on television and just leaves, he wasn't even there when the broadcast was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.157" offset="5028028">And this speech of his, this commercial of his is played in the morning, in the afternoon and the evening of October 29th and he says you can't do anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.516" offset="5085393">It is our contention that any such interpretation of 315 is extreme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.775" offset="5118516">It attacks the rights of the individual who is not a candidate as far as the individual who has, including in our case the Farmers Educational who is the petitioner in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1339.920" offset="5463019">Would the newspaper be exempt from libel?</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.683" offset="5474095">The question here would be, we submit, a pertinent illustration of the inequity of a provision if it wouldn't print.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.576" offset="5509726">But if it could be held that section 315 is a very unusual and a very unique concept, it makes, it compels a station to give equal time to the other side, equal opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.705" offset="5586213">Now that concept sounds now after a third of a century, it's only the way we are used to, we have nothing like that, Your Honor, in the newspaper world, we have nothing like that in any field of written communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.338" offset="5632711">And we say that such a statute couldn't conceivably have given the right to a newspaper or as in this case we have here a television station to be exempt from liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.069" offset="5687672">Why not, why should it be because this new man, the third person, the candidate, he might be the second candidate comes in and he says we want the right to speak.</text>

            <text syncTime="1417.899" offset="5774921">It is our contention that any such interpretation of the statute is a misinterpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.250" offset="5804387">The defendant in this case or the respondent in this case has associated with it several amici curiae.</text>

            <text syncTime="1462.970" offset="5955271">They contended in the case of Port Huron and later on before the Federal Communications Commission, and later on before the Congress that the statute said just what we say it said.</text>

            <text syncTime="1888.815" offset="7658663">As the Court is aware half of our time will be shared by the National Association of Broadcasters, as amicus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.176" offset="7696071">The respondent is a member of the National Association of Broadcasters and as such shares views largely that will express -- be expressed amicus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.274" offset="7736508">We, however, must limit our arguments essentially to the narrow framework of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.855" offset="7762840">And it leads us directly to Sorensen against Wood which we feel is the foundation of the confusion that has brought on this litigation today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.050" offset="7827623">In 1932, the Nebraska Court, in a dicta, the defendant in the action was not a candidate, in a pure dicta, had this to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.298" offset="7888541">The defendant company like most radio broadcasters is to a large extent engaged in the business of commercial advertising for pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.866" offset="7918843">It maybe assumed that this is sufficient not only to carry, it's necessary large overhead, but to make at least a fair return on its investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.898" offset="7946951">Or it appears that the opportunities are so attractive to investors and the available airwave would be greatly overcrowded by broadcasting stations, were it not for restrictions of a number of licensees under the Federal Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.999" offset="7995329">Such commercial advertising is strongly competitive with newspaper advertising, because it performs a similar office between those having wares to advertise and those who are potential users of those wares.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.606" offset="8041827">Radio advertising is one of the most powerful agencies to promote the principles of religion and politics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.912" offset="8063039">It competes with newspapers, magazines and publications of every nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.260" offset="8080384">The fundamental principles of law involved in publication by a newspaper and by a radio station seem to be alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.019" offset="8115493">There is no legal reason why one should be favored over another, nor why a broadcasting station should be granted special favors as against one who maybe a victim of a libelous publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.487" offset="8177351">It must be remembered that in the 1927 the broadcasting industry as we know it today was about four years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.625" offset="8213922">The respondent went into business in 1923 and is one of the oldest stations in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.528" offset="8245478">It must be remembered too, that in writing in the provisions of the Radio Act, which became Section 315, the writers of the provisions, that is to say the members of Congress were particularly experts in the matter about which they legislate, the matter of that broadcast of non-censored material by political candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.456" offset="8345161">Therefore in one section of the Communications Act, the Congress said there shall be no censorship by government, Section 315, 316, and in another section, Section 315, it said that there shall be no interposition of a screen of public opinion by a licensee, a broadcaster in what field only where there was a candidate for office, and no other field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.775" offset="8482461">This is the limitations imposed in 1927.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.153" offset="8500015">And this matter was considered in Nebraska, in case of Sorensen against Wood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.914" offset="8527078">In most distinguished amicus Lawrence Gold did a great deal of work and I am conceived, we argue upon the basis of this factual situation, that there is an equity, an equitable matter to be adjusted between broadcasters and the newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.423" offset="8613073">That it would be inequitable and unfair to have a different rule of law for the two at the two advertising mediums, that were then in Professor Wowl's concepts vying with each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.553" offset="8693635">Consequently Sorensen against Wood simply destroys the usual concept of the word sensor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.401" offset="8744939">Sorensen against Wood says that the words and there shall be no power of censorship means that the broadcaster is obligated to sensor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.116" offset="8803871">And this must of necessity be the petitioner's position here, that the broadcaster is obligated to sensor in all matters except in Sorensen against Wood, matters having political -- matters of political influence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.949" offset="8863117">Now this certainly does violence to the concept of censorship and the word censorship, and it precipitated 16 as General Greenbaum has said said, 16 different attempts by the same Congress, the continuing body, 16 different attempts to solve the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.195" offset="8968129">I would be less than candid if I did not say that I think that all Congress has done in these 16 times, is to fail to face the problem and arrive at a thought out conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.982" offset="9027271">Because my preparation of this case must of necessity be away from the congressional record of the debates, I am not as familiar with that as I should like to be, but it does seem to me that it maybe said fairly in the brevity of moral argument, that Congress has arrived at nothing, there has been an argument here and an argument there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.023" offset="9135417">Now I understand that amicus, Mr. Anello will argue with you that there is something to be spelled out in Congress, and from the lack of congressional action, as the respondent has argued and the petitioner has argued, that there is something to be spelled out, but we most be respectfully assert that the Congress has failed to face up to the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.148" offset="9219950">Now where is television today, and this I think is the gravamen of our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.716" offset="9254222">Television, radio, electronic communication, was said by this Court to be a dynamic industry in the Pottsville case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.773" offset="9314513">The fact of it's dynamism is evidenced by the fact of our being here and by the truth of General Greenbaum's arguments, that it is a deplorable situation so far as this petitioner is concerned, that we a respectable licensed broadcaster attempting to discharge our obligations as a licensee, of the government licensing, are faced with the problem of presenting a deliberate libel under circumstances such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.971" offset="9463306">I should amplify the statement of fact made by General Greenbaum just to this extent and this is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.098" offset="9491728">When Mr. Townley presented his case, his proposed writ to the broadcaster, the broadcaster examined it, advised him that it was in its opinion libelous and untrue and advised him to believe it to be untrue, refused to broadcast it unless a written demand was made, which was made under the provisions of Section 315, a demand under the mandate, as broadcaster understood it, and then instead of putting Townley on the air live, as could have been done, required Mr. Townley to film his telecast, so there could be no question of an ad lib remark, the (Inaudible), required him to film his telecast and then film, and then published it once, and I most respectfully correct to, published it once in accordance with its contract with Mr. Tommy and under the mandate of 315.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.997" offset="9727352">This was the action that the broadcaster was forced to take under the provisions of the court here on decision and under the provisions of the WDSU warning, which came after, the only two things in my view, the only two concrete definite things that the commission has done, regardless of the arguments pro and con in the debates and before the committees, the only two things that the broadcaster is entitled and may look to for guidance.</text>

            <text syncTime="4750.809" offset="19106565">But I would like to analogize this newspaper, radio station position a little more closely.</text>
            <text syncTime="4760.608" offset="19145853">Let us examine the situation in 1927, when the Radio Act was first promulgated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4767.672" offset="19174066">At that time as you all know there was chaos because stations encroaching upon each other, and so the Congress established a Federal Radio Commission, at that time there were some 600 stations on the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="4784.100" offset="19239790">The Congress enacted comprehensive legislation, because it felt that is -- that the radio spectrum was limited, so the number of stations would never be too many, but what do we have?</text>
            <text syncTime="4796.682" offset="19290049">We have today over 4,800 radio and television stations in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4802.854" offset="19314813">Now what's happened to newspapers in the same time?</text>
            <text syncTime="4805.614" offset="19325785">In 1930 there were roughly 1,900 daily newspapers, today there are 1,800 daily newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4814.141" offset="19359953">Now the argument has been made that it is competition that causes a newspaper to either prosper or wither.</text>
            <text syncTime="4822.209" offset="19392240">It serves its readers and that is why apart from any First Amendment you need no regulation, assumedly you might because it's interstate commerce if a newspaper sends editions in the various states, you might concededly issue a regulation there, but no, the First Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4843.441" offset="19477086">Well, the same thing might be said of radio stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4847.023" offset="19491506">With 4,800 stations on the air, I believe that competition will determine which survives, which will program in the public interest and which don't, I am confident that the American people may make the judgment, that those that do not serve the public interest by their programming, without regard to the FCC or any other legislative or regulatory body will fall by the wayside.</text>

            <text syncTime="4883.292" offset="19636537">I am saying that I believe that one of the reasons for not regulating newspapers apart from traditional freedom of the First Amendment is that the ordinary competitive forces will force the newspaper to cater to the public taste, because it is said anybody can start a newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="4904.176" offset="19720025">That means anybody who can buy a printing press, ergo if you build a better newspaper, you will get readers, and if you don't you will lose readers and your circulation and your advertising revenue, but both of us, both newspapers and radio stations live by their advertisers, which in turn means that we must have readers in order to secure revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="4929.391" offset="19820962">In summation, I would like to say that our position is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4934.267" offset="19840397">Section 315 as we view it, both in the light of congressional intent, historic decisional law and that law is applied by the Federal Communications Commission, prohibits censorship by broadcast licensees of political candidates for the same office, and this means no prior restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="4958.162" offset="19936005">By the same token at the very least, the principles of fairness and justice, administrative interpretation, congressional acquiescence and congressional failure to amend the law in view of their knowledge of the administrative interpretations indicate that automatic immunity must flow and if such is not the case, we believe the section is unconstitutional as being violative of the First Amendment and that it would take the broadcaster's property without due process, the property which he would be powerless to protect.</text>

            <text syncTime="5144.248" offset="20680391">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5148.406" offset="20697004">I think that some of the sessions have gotten away from the central issue in this case, which is whether under Section 315, Station WDAY, the respondent in this case is immune from damages for broadcasting material which was admittedly libelous about our client, the Farmers Educational and Cooperative Union of North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="5176.681" offset="20810062">As Mr. Bangert said in his argument, Congress has not conferred any immunity from such a suit as this, and as Mr. Justice Harlan indicated in his question, over and over again Congress has been asked to legislate this immunity and over and over again Congress has refused so to legislate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5201.266" offset="20908387">Mr. Anello who immediately preceded me, gave reasons why he did not think the Congress could be said to have acted against immunity in this situation, but in a brief filed by his own association, a little over ten years ago, which I have in my hands and which was submitted to the Congress in connection with the hearings on the Port Huron case, he said it seems equally certain that they did not -- that Congress determined to say out of the field of defamation and to leave the state laws on libel and slander untouched.</text>
            <text syncTime="5240.383" offset="21064913">There is no provision in Section 315, which confers any immunity on a radio or television station for broadcasting libelous remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="5253.188" offset="21116113">There is another provision in the Federal Communication Act, namely Section 414 which states specifically that the Act shall not be construed in such a way as to abridge or alter the remedies now existing at common law or by statute, but the provisions of this chapter shall be in addition to such remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5280.021" offset="21223424">By arguing as we found that Mr. Anello does, it seems to us that they totally over list the existence of Section 414 and read into Section 315, words which are obviously not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5296.508" offset="21289357">I say obviously not there because as has been apparent in the course of this argument, there have been repeated efforts to put them there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5305.671" offset="21326033">This is not a case of Congress having not acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5308.795" offset="21338572">It's a case in which Congress acted by refusing to legislate immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5315.590" offset="21365739">No one had even made any contention that broadcasters were immune from liability, until 1948 in the famous Port Huron case which we've already discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5329.103" offset="21419760">As a matter of fact, some three years before that, the commission itself had expressed great doubt as to whether or not an immunity existed in the Bellingham case and had specifically tabled that question and said we are not called upon to decide whether there is an immunity under state law or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5351.031" offset="21507532">When the Port Huron case came along there followed the congressional hearing which we have already discussed, then the case of WDSU reiterated Port Huron about the meaning of censorship, but did not categorically assert that there was an immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5368.946" offset="21579107">As I recall the words of the commission in the WDSU, there was something like whatever maybe the rule as to immunity we hope such and such as the censorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="5382.379" offset="21632920">Shortly after the decision in the Port Huron case, there were further considerations of the matter in Congress and the house tax and immunity amendment which was rejected again in 1952 by the Conference Committee, and this time in report number 2426 82d Cong., 2d session, which is cited on page ten of our reply brief, the Committee of Conference stated very definitely what it thought it was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5414.479" offset="21761337">And I quote what they said, “The committee of conference agreed to omit the provision with respect to liability of licensees in civil or criminal actions because these subjects had not been adequately studied by the Committees on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the Senate and the House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="5435.491" offset="21845347">The proposal was adopted in the House after the bill had been reported from the House Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5441.022" offset="21867499">The proposal involves many difficult problems and it is the judgment of the Committee of Conference that it should be acted on only after full hearing has been held.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5452.045" offset="21911594">Since that time identical bills have been introduced into Congress on either six or seven occasions and on each such occasion Congress has expressly refused to legislate the immunity which the Supreme Court of North Dakota held existed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5473.858" offset="21998843">Apparently no one seriously denied this Congressional history but the allegation is that you can infer immunity from the no censorship provision of Section 315 in the teeth of Congressional refusal to declare immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5494.529" offset="22081494">I would like very briefly to address myself to a few questions which came out in the course of the discussions that preceded my getting up.</text>
            <text syncTime="5503.234" offset="22116289">One was Mr. Bangert's statement about the (Inaudible) of having 48 or now 50 different laws of libel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5511.024" offset="22147427">I am sure it's not necessary to call to the attention of this Court that in all of broadcasting, except possibly under section 315, there are 48 or 50 different state laws of libel which apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="5527.639" offset="22213883">Mr. Bangert argues the case as if he were pleading for a federal law of defamation applicable to all television and radio broadcasting.</text>
            <text syncTime="5538.360" offset="22256828">There is no such federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5541.089" offset="22267695">Congress has not chosen to act, even assuming it had the power to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5546.744" offset="22290369">What the licensee does everyday is to act with reference to the laws of 48 or 50 different states?</text>
            <text syncTime="5555.686" offset="22326105">Furthermore as to whether the prohibition of Section 315 on censorship is absolute, which some of Your Honors have asked, I would like to call your attention to the fact that the Supreme Court of North Dakota in two instances acknowledged that it was not absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5574.517" offset="22401442">In the first place it quoted with approval and we cite that -- this appears on page 37 of the record, the statement of the Federal Communications Commission itself indicating that the censorship -- the no censorship provision is not absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5593.518" offset="22477406">The commission said and I quote here on, “Nothing in this opinion is intended to indicate that a licensee is necessarily without power to present to broadcast of statements or utterances in violation of the provisions of the Communications Act or any other federal law on broadcast coming within the requirement of Section 315 of the Communications Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5616.366" offset="22568835">I don't believe the commission has ever retreated from that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="5621.162" offset="22588061">The second thing that the North Dakota Supreme Court did by way of I think revolt against its own apparently absolute standard was to say in its judgment on (Inaudible) not that the station could not -- was immune for all statements but only that the stations were immune from liability for defamatory statements made by candidates, and the exact words of the court, the judgments are “where such statements are germane to the political issues discussed by such candidates,” this appears at the top of the page 52 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5663.610" offset="22757857">We submit that the standard of germaness which apparently was used by the court below is a standard which would clearly be in violation of the no censorship provisions of Section 315.</text>
            <text syncTime="5679.758" offset="22822431">We do not believe that that is true of any standard which would permit a licensee to continue to function in accordance with state law that is to refuse to aid and abet the commission of an act in the state which would violate either the civil or the criminal law of the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="5750.965" offset="23107271">If we take -- if the Congress has created a situation in which the station is impudent to delete libels then we are faced with two innocent third parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="5770.285" offset="23184488">Now the station is in my opinion far more likely -- should be the one on whom liability is accessed as between the two for many reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="5799.500" offset="23301413">It can simply refuse to accept any political candidates' broadcast.</text>
            <text syncTime="5804.247" offset="23320325">In the second place, we believe that the station is in a position where it could protect itself in a variety of ways in a situation in which Your Honor mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5813.969" offset="23359300">For example it could ask the candidate to set -- to put up a bond, an indemnity bond so that if the station would have libel, it would have some protection on the indemnity bond of the candidate.</text>
