            <text syncTime="12.221" offset="152221">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.319" offset="160684">This is a federal narcotics conviction here on the question with respect to the admissibility of evidence seized at the time of an arrest without warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.693" offset="218154">The case depends therefore upon the issue whether or not the arresting agent had probably case to make the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.078" offset="263711">The arrest was made in the railroad station in Denver.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.678" offset="282102">A few days after the arresting agent had received information from an informer, whose identity was disclosed at the trial, the informer in the mean time having conveniently died so that his identity was easily disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.891" offset="354931">The informer had done this.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.468" offset="365275">He had telephoned the agent saying Draper is a peddler.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.433" offset="401115">Nothing happened after that.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.553" offset="409579">No attempt was made to shuttle Draper.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.311" offset="428596">Few days later the informer calls up again and he says, "Draper has gone to Chicago and will come back in a day or two with narcotics."</text>
            <text syncTime="99.594" offset="501739">A description of Draper was given to the agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.427" offset="521070">Nothing was done then in any attempt to check on Draper's movements in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.322" offset="556701">But the agents, a whole group of them went to the railroad station on each of the succeeding days and watched trains as they came in from Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.542" offset="609573">And on the second of the two days, they saw a man who answered the description which had been given.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.568" offset="645622">They approached him -- or one of the agents approached him, asking his name, the agent testified that he gave a certain name which later turned out not to be his, they then placed him under arrest, searched him and found the heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.714" offset="734229">A motion was timely made to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.101" offset="747813">The evidence so seized was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.065" offset="763591">The conviction affirmed, with a strong dissent this Court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.792" offset="798490">Now we contended that this was an improper arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.889" offset="830882">That the agent acted on hearsay that the hearsay was conclusory and more over that there was not even information given to the agent that a crime had in fact been committed but merely information that it was expected that a crime was going to be committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.485" offset="953344">The court below recognized that the information given by the informer would not have justified the arrest, the agent at the trial on the appearance to suppress did not testify whether he had enquired of the informer, what basis the informer had for the statements made.</text>

            <text syncTime="258.862" offset="1138813">The government was in possession of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.222" offset="1152293">If any inquiry had been made by the agent of the informer it was the government's duty to bring out the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.303" offset="1188551">I don't think the defendant was under any obligation whatever to cross-examine on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.617" offset="1221883">The government's case was simply inadequate in its own presentation of its evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.368" offset="1244871">There was no reason why the defendant should anyway seek -- supplement the government's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.885" offset="1270888">Now, the suggestion is made however by the court below and by the government that the information obtained was corroborated.</text>

            <text syncTime="330.236" offset="1424280">It may well be that if they had done that at the time and the informer had also gone before the magistrate, the informer might have been able to supplement the conclusory information which he had given and therefore a warrant might have issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.542" offset="1489586">But I submit that on the mere statement which the agent could have made, there would be no probably cause.</text>

            <label>Mr. Osmond K. Fraenkel</label>
            <text syncTime="418.256" offset="1776410">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.694" offset="1778186">It would not be all right in my opinion in this particular case because the charge -- the arrest here was based on the assumption that he was returning from Chicago with narcotics in his possession at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.303" offset="1856554">Now -- and a warrant might have been obtained on the basis of the informer's knowledge that an offense had been committed in the past which might justify prosecution, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.323" offset="1912665">But here, that wasn't the basis of the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.505" offset="1941400">And the inference which the government asks this Court to draw was that from the mere circumstance that the informer had given a description which fitted a particular individual and that individual came from a train which had started in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.070" offset="2011617">And I think I have been somewhat swept away by some of the government's arguments because I noticed in rereading my reply brief that I sort of assumed that this defendant had been in Chicago.But of course there is nothing to justify that inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.299" offset="2080580">The mere fact that a train comes from a place doesn't indicate the person on the train came from the point of origin of the train.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.498" offset="2109315">But their argument is the mere fact that he was on a train from Chicago and answered the description justified the inference that while in Chicago he had violated the law.And I say that cannot be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.715" offset="2166262">Now, many cases have been cited by both sides in lower courts, which are all over the place.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.020" offset="2195414">They can't be reconciled basically.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.715" offset="2206281">Some of them can be distinguished on the basis of particular facts in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.693" offset="2230105">But I think it will be found that the better reason of all the cases go on the basis that the Second Circuit merely in the case last cited in the government -- by the government, at the end of its own brief, namely from where there is information obtained, the agents have a duty to do something and in that particular case after receiving information of pretty much the same kind this was received here, the agents didn't jump in and make an immediate arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.272" offset="2372420">They followed the man.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.460" offset="2381197">They shadowed him to such a point that the man became aware of the fact that he was being shadowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.538" offset="2409514">And on a particular occasion when the shadowing continued, made that awareness evident, in other words showed a consciousness of guilt as in for instance in the Husty case decided by this Court also cited by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.639" offset="2481925">The element of consciousness of guilt was involved because there, when the agents approached a car, the people in it started to run away.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.545" offset="2529573">Now, in such situations where the arresting agents do something to justify an inference that a crime is being committed the arrest maybe a valid one.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.032" offset="2587460">But I say that here, where the agents did nothing, you cannot draw any comfort from the circumstances that the individual answered the description, because obviously you never would have an arrest of a person unknown to agents unless somebody was able to give a description, and say at what place he was likely to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.434" offset="2681083">And if from that mere mechanical fact which has no relation to the commission of crime, whatever, it is proper to draw an inference that a crime has been committed merely because somebody tells an agent that a crime is going to be committed, then I suggest our liberties are pretty far gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.631" offset="2757883">And it seems to me that this case, without going into the basic question of hearsay, can rest on the proposition, that where information is obtained, it is the duty of the officer to whom the information is given in the first place to ascertain the basis on which the informant gives that information, has that information, and to testify either before a magistrate when seeking a warrant or before a court when the validity of the arrest is in question, to testify with regard to those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.289" offset="2928515">So, that the magistrate or the court can determine whether that testimony is sufficient, those details are sufficient, to justify an inference in a commission of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.463" offset="2965191">And in that respect it seems to me this case is very similar to the Giordenello case decided by this Court in the last term, where information was held insufficient, because conclusory only.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.766" offset="3018480">So I say here the probable cause is insufficient, because based only on conclusions, and this case I submit is even stronger than the other one, because in at least in Giordenello, the statement of the complaint was positive that a crime had been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.481" offset="3093295">Whereas here this record can be searched in vain for any information given to the arresting officer, that a crime had been committed, all that is claimed is that the informer said he is going to Chicago to buy heroin, and that was several days before he returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.663" offset="3169991">The agents might have made up to check, they made no efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.566" offset="3189635">We submit therefore that the evidence was -- the arrest was illegal, that the arrest is illegal, the evidence was improperly received.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.937" offset="3223071">Obviously without that evidence, the procession of the heroin, the conviction could not stand.</text>

            <text syncTime="815.760" offset="3366431">And I think that what was said by Mr. Justice Jackson in the Johnson case which I quote, which dealt with search warrants rather than arrest warrants, bears on the issue, because it was the purpose of the Fourth Amendment to require officers of the law who Mr. Justice Jackson quite appropriately described as often being engaged in the competitive business of ferreting out crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.792" offset="3462562">To have regard for the rights of citizen, and therefore not to act on their own judgment, but to submit facts to the magistrate for his determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.056" offset="3503626">Now, we -- I recognize as I said before, that this Court has carved out exceptions as in the case of moving vehicles, and I should suppose that they might carve out a similar exception in the case of hot pursuit, to justify an arrest on hearsay, simply because under such circumstances, no opportunity exists to do anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.637" offset="3597876">While the government tries that analogize this, because of the ease with which narcotics can been disposed of, I think that's an oversimplification.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.990" offset="3635284">Obviously a person who is -- as is suggested here by the informer, engaged in the business of peddling doesn't do it just once.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.246" offset="3668407">And good police work might have enabled the government by watching him to have caught him as was done in many of the other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.160" offset="3711979">After all, the (Inaudible) conviction was reversed because good police work didn't operate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1178.246" offset="4816332">And I'd like to begin with the relationship between the arresting agent and the informer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.272" offset="4848410">To indicate that this was not a casual relationship, this was not the case of an anonymous telephone call or -- although record indicates a telephone call of any sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.427" offset="4897102">The informant in this case had for a period of six months furnished information to agent Marsh, which agent Marsh, the arresting officer, had personally corroborated and in each instance had found that the information was reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.849" offset="4966797">And so here the source of the information is a source of proven reliability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.636" offset="4997935">On September 3rd, 1956, the informer told agent Marsh that the petitioner was living at a certain address in Denver and was peddling heroine, was then and there engaged in the illicit narcotic traffic, was presently engaged in narcotic dealings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.325" offset="5096678">Thereafter on September 7th and I -- I have reference to the -- page eight of the record, on September 7th, the informant told the agent, that on the day before, the day before petitioner had gone to Chicago and would return either the following day, the 8th of September or the 9th of September.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.179" offset="5200123">And so, while it maybe very well to speculate that the petitioner should have been followed to Chicago, the first information that the government had was after he had already gone to Chicago, it was not possible under this information to -- to reach him in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.559" offset="5293641">The informant indicated that he gone to Chicago by train, as he was going to bring back approximately three ounces of heroine, that he would return to Denver either on the morning of the 8th of September or the morning of the 9th of September also by train, that he was wearing a light colored raincoat and then continues with a very precise description of -- of petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.544" offset="5401579">It has been suggested that the information that was received, it was conclusory, government respectfully submits that the information received was in very great detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.462" offset="5473259">Thereafter the law enforcement agents placed the railroad station under surveillance and on the morning of the 9th of September, which was one of the dates when the informant said the petitioner would return, he did in fact return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.613" offset="5545775">He met the exact physical description down to the last bit of wearing apparel, which had been supplied by the informer, he was in fact carrying a tanned zipper bag, as the informer said he would, and he was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.886" offset="5618918">He gave a name which was immediately proven to be false.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.455" offset="5641174">He was clutching in his pocket, he was clutching his hands in his raincoat, his hand was removed, there were glossy envelopes in his hand.</text>

            <text syncTime="1531.613" offset="6229870">Probable cause exist, this Court said, where the facts and circumstances within there the officers' knowledge and of which they have reasonably trustworthy information, are sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution, in the belief that an offence has been or is being committed."</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.600" offset="6321821">Personal knowledge or of which they have reasonably trustworthy information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.861" offset="6342823">And we suggest that, that is the test, not whether it's hearsay or not, whether it's reasonably trustworthy and reasonable prudent men in their everyday lives, on many, many occasions rely on what they believe is reasonably trustworthy hearsay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.464" offset="6417220">And of course this Court held in the Costello case that a grand jury can return an indictment with the serious consequences that that has, based solely on hearsay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.583" offset="6469674">Judge Hastie said in the -- in United States against Bianco, case which is similar to this and which we cite in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.385" offset="6504887">That what is reasonable is a total judgment and I think that that puts the matter very well, a total judgment, all the circumstances must be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.124" offset="6555878">Was this an anonymous tip on the telephone or was this information which came from somebody whose reliability you have reason to believe in because you have checked with in the past.</text>

            <text syncTime="1641.129" offset="6667891">Petitioners -- the petitioner states that a defect here is of the source of the informant's information was not disclosed and that that is a crucial factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.671" offset="6726092">If the agent asks the informant how do you know this and receives a reply, the quality of that is still no greater, rises to no higher dignity than the credibility of the informant, if for some mischievous motive, this was all a fabrication, the informant could as easily fabricate a -- a source of the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.962" offset="6847195">The other means by which the reliability of the information can be checked is externally by an attempt to corroborate and that is what occurred in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.565" offset="6909680">Now, of course the danger where the source is not disclosed is perhaps this is mere -- mere rumor or gossip.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.755" offset="6942386">I think there are three things in this case which indicate that the information supplied by the informer was not of such a nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.372" offset="6976867">They are the fact that in the past this information had always proved reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.554" offset="6997556">The very nature of the information itself as set forth at page eight and nine of the record, that the precise detail as to the -- as to the time and the mode of dress, and the fact that that prior to the time, the agents made the arrest, they corroborated the fact that Draper got off the train which came from Chicago on the morning of the 9th of September, attired precisely as -- as the informant said he would be attired and carrying the tanned zipper bag.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.242" offset="7156381">Now, it is true as petitioner urges and as the dissenting judge below pointed out, that everything which the agents observed, which served as corroboration, was in and of itself innocent, that every aspect were isolated and considered in and of itself, it would be consistent with innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.766" offset="7262438">But we submit that, that is not the approach, which should be taken and a question of probable cause, but when we should look to the totality of the circumstances and with --</text>

            <text syncTime="1955.569" offset="7925635">Standards which might be reasonable for the apprehension of bank robbers might not be reasonable for the arrest of narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.381" offset="7956877">I would like to deal also with the fact that the information received by the informer was, as petitioner describes it, with respect to a future crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.359" offset="8012779">I note that the first information received was that Draper was peddling heroin in Denver, but this then was to be a step in furtherance of his peddling narcotics in Denver in which he was already engaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.930" offset="8095117">This was not a prediction that somebody was going to enter the narcotic traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.990" offset="8111313">This was a statement that he was going to take some step pursuant to this illegal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.239" offset="8156348">We don't think the fact that this related to a future event, rendered it so inherently improbable that it could not be the basis of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.472" offset="8217266">We think it demonstrates that there was not a prior opportunity to get a search warrant, to get an arrest warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.078" offset="8243702">The first occasion on which the officers knew that -- and had corroborated the fact that Draper was committing or had been committing a crime was when they observed him in the railroad station, so there was no question here of whether there was ample opportunity to have obtained a warrant because there was no such opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.498" offset="8345370">When information is received by law enforcement officer that X has narcotics in his house on 12th street, the possibility then and there present information, the possibility always existed by the time officers will get to 12th street, the narcotics may have been disposed off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.143" offset="8431992">So here, it is possible that Draper may not have in fact gone all the way to Chicago or may have been unsuccessful in his attempt to get the narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.467" offset="8477236">These things we think show that there was not proof beyond a reasonable doubt with mathematical certainty but that's not -- not the requirement of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.735" offset="8534288">Again if I may in Brinegar, this Court said in language which appears at page 15 of the government's brief, "In dealing with probable cause, however, as the very name implies, we deal with probabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.297" offset="8592593">These are not technical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.202" offset="8600221">They are the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act."</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.387" offset="8648913">And we submit that reasonably, reasonable and prudent men would have believed that when all the other information supplied by this informant whose information from the past had always proved reliable was corroborated that the final and ultimate fact that he was carrying heroin that enough -- there was enough reason to believe that that too would be corroborated and to make the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.566" offset="8789661">Finally, we emphasized that in the totality of the circumstances which must be considered in judging the reasonableness of the conduct, again the fact that this was an arrest in daylight in a public place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.263" offset="8844413">It may very well be that the -- that the quantum of evidence which police officers must have before they may enter a private dwelling, the extent of the invasion of the privacy must be considered in balance and in regard to the quantum of information they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.721" offset="8930304">And here this was a day light arrest in a public place, the search was only of the person, of the defendant and of the bag which was in his immediate physical control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.275" offset="8980459">Both courts below have found on these facts that probable cause existed and those concurrent findings we submit should be affirmed by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2244.506" offset="9081396">Insofar as the government may suggest that the Draper's giving of a fictitious name has any bearing on the validity of the arrest, I want to call Your Honor's attention to the testimony of the arresting officer at page 9 of the record which clearly indicates the arrest occurred before the questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.799" offset="9182542">So the fact is out of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.078" offset="9199679">Insofar as it is suggested that there was no opportunity to get a warrant of arrest, I submit that if the informant who presumably had some information which was reliable and if he didn't, certainly this arrest was unjustified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.927" offset="9279091">If the informant on the basis of that information that Draper had committed a crime in the past, had gone before a magistrate, a warrant could have issued and they could had that warrant the time when Draper arrived to Chicago, not based on the purchase in Chicago but based on the alleged offenses previously committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.412" offset="9373027">And finally the suggestion is that a warrant couldn't be obtained here because the heroin might have disappeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.204" offset="9408240">On the analogy of the search warrant can be obtained on information that during lives in a home although by the time they get there it may be gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.421" offset="9449096">I don't see the relevance of that analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.925" offset="9459022">The validity of the search warrant would be tested on the basis of the information disclosed to the magistrate who issued search warrant and the fact that circumstances might change that were irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.586" offset="9505729">So here, this arrest must be based on the -- must be justified on the basis of the information which the arresting officer disclosed to the Court at the time of the hearing, not on the basis of what might have been disclosed to a magistrate at sometime by other people or even on the basis of what the agent might have had in the back of his head which he didn't disclose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.777" offset="9614503">And it is suggested -- well, it would have been easy for the informer to invent a story if this was malicious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.009" offset="9647417">I say it's an agent's duty to press an informant for detail because details sometimes disclose their own weakness or the malice of the informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.537" offset="9713560">And if an agent is under a duty to require a disclosure by the informant he is under a like duty to disclose what he knows to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.165" offset="9752012">In no other way can the question of probable cause really be tried out, because what the government is asking here is that it's enough for agent to get up in Court and say, an informant on whom I relied told me that this man was – had done -- violated the criminal law at some unspecified time in the past and was going to violate it again in some -- in the future so I arrest him.</text>

            <text syncTime="2460.665" offset="9946049">Then the burden of going forward with the evidence shifts to the government to justify that arrest on the basis of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.084" offset="9975724">And if the government having knowledge of facts doesn't disclose those facts, it certainly not the defendant's obligation to attempt to bring them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.989" offset="10007280">We submit, we suspect that the government didn't have the facts disclosed, that the agent in this case didn't ask the informer the basis of his knowledge if he had any, or his information had came from someone else.</text>
