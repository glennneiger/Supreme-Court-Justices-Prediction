            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Mr. Davis.</text>

            <label>Mr. John F. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="5.609" offset="125785">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.971" offset="155251">The very heart of the petitioner's case is that Congress has attempted to punish guilt by association and that this is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.327" offset="216691">We agree that a man may not be punished for the sins of others but only for his own fault that can be brought onto him personally.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.023" offset="259427">Any other course would be dangerous indeed since the motives which lead a man to associate himself with others may be quite different from the main motifs of the persons with whom he becomes associated.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.003" offset="315434">A man might join the Communist Party because he was lonely.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.258" offset="328391">He might join it for romantic reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.128" offset="339884">He might not approve of the purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.414" offset="349080">We feel that you've got to bring the guilt onto the individual in order that he may be punished.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.595" offset="373739">But the petitioner's argument depends upon reading the statute in the most unfavorable way that it can be read.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.707" offset="410206">It requires one to read the word “membership” as being the equivalent of being carried on the Party rolls.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.033" offset="451480">Now, it is quite clear from the entire structure of the Smith Act that Congress had something quite different in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.487" offset="481364">In Section 1, they forbid people to advocate the overthrow of the Government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.890" offset="522951">In Section 3, they hold that it -- they make it illegal to organize a machine to advocate the overthrow of the Government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.888" offset="570911">And, in the membership clause which we are dealing with, they make it illegal for a person to make that machine run.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.232" offset="612289">In other words, we would argue here, as we argued in our supplemental brief before the Court last term, that when Congress uses the word “membership,” it means active membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.251" offset="660355">It means something more than being carried on the rolls of the Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.833" offset="690657">And, it was because of this interpretation that, when the case went back for retrial, the Court instructed the jury that in order to find the defendant guilty, it must find that he was not only a member but an active member of a proscribed organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.284" offset="784488">Now, this is not really amending the -- amending the statute by judicial construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.638" offset="809880">It's -- it's construing the statute to determine what the intent of Congress was when it passed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.865" offset="834853">It is something which the Court does in determining the constitutionalities of statutes day after day.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.740" offset="862333">On membership itself, we find the courts have -- have frequently read the term “membership” in order to determine what would be a reasonable meaning in the -- in the minds of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.838" offset="906742">I think a very important case in this is -- is Colyer against Skeffington.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.617" offset="921788">It's a District Court case but it's a case which -- which passed directly on it, whether the District Court said that the Immigration Law provision for -- for sending aliens home could not be applied to aliens who accidentally, artificially, or unconsciously, in appearance only are found to be members or affiliated with a -- with a subversive organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.881" offset="1026905">And we find this Court using the same thought of approach in Bridges against Wixon, where they said that, in that case, they were dealing with the term “affiliation” as well as “membership” but where they said that the affiliation had to be an active thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.171" offset="1092106">It had to be a giving of aid rather than merely an agreement with the -- with the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.907" offset="1123035">And, so, I say that the only -- the only way that this -- that the petitioner can support his argument is by taking a -- a limited meaning of -- of the word “membership” which is very probably, almost inevitably, quite contrary to what the Congress had intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.009" offset="1203388">And, once we -- once we discard this limited interpretation which is urged by the petitioner, then I think that the case really involves no constitutional question which is different from that which was involved in -- in the Dennis case and in the Yates case because I see no constitutional difference between forbidding persons to organize a -- a party to advocate the overthrow of the Government by force and violence and forbidding persons to make that party operate once it has been organized.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.062" offset="1359600">There may be a difference in degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.792" offset="1366497">It seems to me, there is no difference in kind and, since this Court has met the constitutional problem in Dennis and has really supported it in Yates, I think that it really decide -- it's decided it for this case, nor do I think that the Brandeis-Holmes concurrence in the Whitney case, to which General Taylor referred, is against this.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.884" offset="1478928">In that concurrence, they were not really talking about membership as distinguished from the activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.262" offset="1512469">They were actually talking about both organization and membership, and the question was whether or not the organization and membership, together, constituted a clear and present danger sufficient to sustain the constitutionality of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.562" offset="1585612">The opinion in the very paragraph which is quoted by the petitioner, the opinion flunks the membership and the organizing features into one legal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.783" offset="1662516">And, in any event, I may say that, in this particular case, on the pec -- basis of this particular record, there is no reason for this Court to determine the constitutionality or the unconstitutionality of the statute as it would be if it were applied to an entirely different set of facts where this is no active membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.526" offset="1761468">As Judge Hand pointed out in the Dennis case, the statute -- the Smith Act contains a separability clause providing that if the statute shall be held -- the statute or any part of the statute shall be held unconstitutional with respect to any particular circumstance or situation, it shall not affect its remaining in effect with respect to a different circumstance, a different situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.103" offset="1879751">And so, here, I say that in a situation where you have active membership found by the jury, sustained by the court below, there is no occasion for this Court to pass upon the constitutionality of the application of this particular statute to a situation where there is no active membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.737" offset="1974314">Now, with this interpretation in mind and with the opinion of this Court in the Yates case in mind as to what Congress intended to outlaw, that is, that it intended to outlaw advocacy of action, incitement to action rather than the promotion of thoughts, of ideas, I think that the next real question is whether or not, on this record, the Government proved its case, whether it proved that the Communist Party as such, and we are not talking now, if you please, about the defendant -- about the petitioner, Scales, we're talking about the Communist Party as such because, under the terms of the Act, the important thing is whether the Party advocates the overthrow of the Government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.064" offset="2215581">The question is does this record establish that the Communist Party does engage in illegal advocacy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1998.097" offset="8095744">Petitioner has argued here, as he argued below, that in inciting to action, the Government relied upon any incitement to any kind of action, whether it was lawful action or unlawful action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.848" offset="8166797">And, he refers to some testimony with respect to getting people to write to congressmen with respect to the Korean War and some of those of things, and there is a remark -- there is a remark by Government counsel in connection with the introduction of these three exhibits which can be read to mean that this means incitement to action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.908" offset="8275048">And, I think that remark is erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.855" offset="8290826">But the charge of the jury -- the charge of the -- of the judge to the jury is perfectly clear on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.935" offset="8331160">There was -- General -- General Taylor said that the charge with respect to incitement to action began at page 40.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.998" offset="8359372">I would think that it would be better to start with page A -- A39.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.984" offset="8387271">I am sorry but it's not 39, it's A39.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.661" offset="8405974">The appendix to the -- the first appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.521" offset="8413497">And, if you start at page 39, the second paragraph down, and run them through the material which General Taylor referred to, I think you'll have the entire instruction with respect to incitement and I think you will find that it follows very carefully, indeed it would be strange if it didn't, that it follows very carefully the instructions which this Court, in effect, gave in the Yates case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.073" offset="8523630">So that the idea that this jury found incitement on the basis of incitement to legal action, in -- in light of this charge, seems to me is -- is impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.243" offset="8588309">Now, I want to turn to the question of construction which arises because of the presence of Section -- subsection (f) in Section 4 of the Internal Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.222" offset="8668244">As General Taylor has said, the Internal Security Act of the section which was involved in -- with this case dealt with the registration of Communist organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.356" offset="8728848">And at -- after -- while it was on -- on the floor in the House, a letter was written by the John Davis and by the Attorney General in a second letter, and both of these letters called attention to the fact that this statute might be attacked on constitutionality on the ground that it would require a person to confess a crime by registering.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.678" offset="8858102">First, they amended it by saying that the registration couldn't be introduced in evidence, and lawyers in the Congress said that's not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.649" offset="8898017">The fact you can't introduce the registration itself in evidence won't give protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.500" offset="8917347">You've got to go further.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.632" offset="8925915">So, then, they introduced this provision, which now appears in the Smith Act, which reads “neither the holding of office nor membership in any Communist organization by any person shall constitute per se a violation of subsection (a) or subsection (c) of this Section or of any other criminal statute.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.702" offset="9030196">So, insofar as the language is important here is, membership per se shall not be considered a violation of any other criminal statute, and it's agreed that they had the Smith Act in mind when they talked about “any other criminal statute.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.324" offset="9108668">And then, there is subs -- then, there is Section 17 which provides the foregoing provisions of this subject shall be construed as being in addition to, and not in modification of, existing criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.147" offset="9175960">Now, what Congress was obviously doing here was saying “When we get somebody up for not registering, we don't want them to say we didn't have to register because the statute was unconstitutional because it required us to confess a crime.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.471" offset="9257253">They were saying it isn't a crime to be a member per se, and they say it shan't be a member -- it shan't be a crime under (a), subsection (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.096" offset="9279718">It shan't be a crime under subsection (c) or any other statute, including the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.099" offset="9319737">So, they were saying that no one could escape registration on the ground of constitutionality on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.049" offset="9355577">Now, this may be an aid to -- to construction of -- of the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.604" offset="9373759">Indeed, it may show congressional intent long after the event, to be sure, that -- that they didn't mean just membership or just office-holding to be criminal by itself, but it cannot -- I think it cannot be said to show any intent to repeal those sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.915" offset="9459022">Now, this Court could say, I think, although none of the Courts of Appeals have had difficulty with this problem, I may say it's been up in the Fourth Circuit, the Second Circuit, the Seventh Circuit in the District of Columbia and that, in none of -- in all of those Circuits, it's -- the construction which the Government is urging here has been sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.348" offset="9568737">It -- the Court could hold that this was a -- this effected a repeal, but I think that they'd have to do it on the basis that Congress made a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.038" offset="9615548">Congress, in using these words, pulled a bona that they repealed it against their will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.859" offset="9646791">I don't think that there's anything in this legislative history which shows that Congress had that intent to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.630" offset="9677928">And, I really can't believe, in view of Section 17, that this Court could reach that construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.975" offset="9703320">Let me say that if it repeals or modifies the membership clause in this respect, it must equally, I suppose, modify subsections (a) and (c) of the internal -- of Section 4 of the Internal Security Act because it's used in perfect parallel, and I suppose that the -- I suppose the petitioner must argue that Communist Party is -- members of Communist Party are no longer subject to Sections (a) and (c) of the Internal Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.658" offset="9825991">He hasn't made the argument in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.811" offset="9838634">It doesn't sound very convincing, but the provisions are in perfect parallel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.955" offset="9863189">And, if you're going to argue that it is a re -- a modification or appeal of one, I should think that you'd have to argue that it was a modification on the repeal of all three.</text>

            <text syncTime="2521.575" offset="10189720">In the -- in this type of Communist -- of Smith Act case, it comes about that the Defense, seems almost automatically, raises certain issues in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.270" offset="10252413">If -- they almost always raise a question as to the constitution of the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.299" offset="10276551">If there's a good question as to the composition of the grand jury, they raise it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.594" offset="10289716">If there isn't a good question, they raise whatever question they can.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.686" offset="10302151">And so, in this case, they attack the composition of the grand jury, and they attack it on the basis that the statutes of the United States require, as they doing in fact require, that the names of the grand jurors be drawn from a box which contains the names of 300 qualified jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.713" offset="10390235">Now, the -- this attack was made late and there is a real question as to whether it was made in time, and the court below threw it out on the basis that it wasn't made in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.287" offset="10436524">I'll leave that to the opinion below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.360" offset="10448854">If it was made in time, there is no substance to the attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.116" offset="10467871">There was a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.317" offset="10476648">The findings of the district judge are included as an appendix to our brief here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.013" offset="10503398">And, you will find that what happened was that the Jury Commissioner and the Deputy Clerk wrote letters to a large number of organizations in an attempt to find the names of people who would be appropriate to service jurors and, when they wrote in these names, the Deputy Clerk and the Jury Commissioner sat down together and they looked over the list.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.150" offset="10604022">And, if they found anybody that they believed was disqualified or that they knew was disqualified, they throw it out, if it was a doctor of the -- someone who have been convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.419" offset="10641011">The rest, they put in the box without sending a questionnaire to these people to find out whether or not they were qualified first and, at the time this grand jury was drawn, there were about 500 names in the box.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.366" offset="10672880">And, the Deputy -- and the Deputy Clerk and the Jury Commissioner testified in the hearing that they, reason -- on the basis of their knowledge of the community, they thought they were reasonably certain, they believe, that there were sufficient number of people in -- of qualified jurors in the box.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.601" offset="10785729">Really, the essence of the attack is there should have been a questionnaire sent out to these prospective jurors before their names were put in the box rather than after they drawn and then you ask them whether they had their qua -- their qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.041" offset="10835571">There's not an indication that a single name in this box was of an unqualified person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.854" offset="10862738">As I say, I think that the -- there's no substance to this attack on the grand jury at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.732" offset="10906311">Then, we come to the question of the admissibility of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.362" offset="10952808">The petitioner takes two rather inconsistent positions on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.275" offset="10976423">First, they argue that the Government relies on Communist activities wholly unrelated to the defendant and that this was improper, and that it didn't -- and, in any event, it didn't prove incitement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.927" offset="11055104">Well, under -- under the terms of the statute, it was essential for us to prove not that the Communist Party in one locality was the kind of an approach -- organization which was proscribe, but the Party as such was the kind of an organization proscribed and, because of that reason, we couldn't limit it to individual persons in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.565" offset="11149667">We had to take the Communist Party as such because that's the Party that was involved here, and we proceeded to try to prove this but, now, the second objection comes that we've proved it too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.337" offset="11196688">We proved -- we present prejudicial evidence about the nature of the Party's aims and we proved incitements to violence which are so strong, it just said, that the counsel can't read them in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.231" offset="11276309">Well, I think that -- I think that the court below decided these questions with a good deal of common sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.355" offset="11312776">It spent very little time with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.063" offset="11319672">It's -- it fine -- it reads the Act and said you have to prove this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.296" offset="11336600">And, as to over-proving it, that's a question of judgment for the Court and the Court -- the courts found that these matters were material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.678" offset="11374111">I haven't -- I haven't even mentioned the Jencks Act point in this case, and I don't propose to go into it unless there is something about its application to this case that this Court is interested in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.257" offset="11424371">I would like to tell the Court, though, exactly what went on so they can see how the Jencks Act did operate in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.685" offset="11466062">The case was tried after the Act has been passed, and many of these witnesses had been reporting repeatedly to the FBI, so that there were voluminous reports made by these witnesses on the subject matter which -- as to which they testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.081" offset="11559685">This material, all of it, including grand jury material which the Court said they didn't believe they had to turn over under the Jencks Act but the Court said “we'll let them have it anyway because, on my discretion, I'm going to exercise my discretion to let them have it in this case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.046" offset="11635545">All of the reports and also the grand jury proceedings were taken by the Court and exertions were made, well, exertions were requested by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.846" offset="11682774">They turned it over -- they turned over excised copies of the documents and they turned over un-excised copies, and the Court compared the two to determine what had been excised and whether it was relevant in any way to the subject matter which was under discussion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2924.239" offset="11800325">And, the Court went over them and turned them over to counsel for use in cross-examination, and how the counsel -- how Defense counsel could try the case with that volume of material to go over, I can't dream because there are two cartons of these reports down there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.527" offset="11865527">And, I'm sure that this must have proved the arduous task for Defense counsel to try to go through these reports and getting it out in the night, they must have had no sleep during the trial if they read all these reports in preparation for cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.821" offset="11930624">But, the materials were turned over and the only objection in this Court is, really, to the constitutionality of the Jencks Act.</text>

            <label>Mr. Telford Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="3180.915" offset="12827042">I think that is the idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.372" offset="12836864">He goes on to speak of the novelty of the statute and that it punishes not even the even the preaching of it but association with those who propose to preach it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.531" offset="12865494">So, he is clearly relating it to what I would regard as assembly -- freedom of assembly in the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.332" offset="12892662">Now, our construction of the membership clause here does not, I think, rest on so bare a construction of the wording, as Mr. Davis suggests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.335" offset="12940727">We do agree that there is room for the interpretation of statutes, even for the purpose of trying to make them constitutional, but we think that the Government has gone much too far here as is shown by that comparative point in our reply brief, especially when they try to bring this all the way to conspiracy by saying this covers deeply conspirational groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.814" offset="13042604">When you've gone that far, you have gone much too far beyond the permissible bounds and you have twisted the “nose of wax,” to use Chief Justice Taft's phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.139" offset="13083878">And, you have also, really, read the membership clause out of the statute because you made it the same as the preceding conspiracy portions, and Mr. Davis didn't really advert to that feature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.956" offset="13131212">He does speak a good deal about this problem of activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.951" offset="13155140">Now, we really don't believe that even if you would read “active” into the statute that that is going to be very much help on constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.793" offset="13194533">In the Yates case, there was a very careful survey of the evidence pertaining to individual defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.379" offset="13228910">If activity, by itself, were to be an index of constitutionality here, I would have assumed that all those defendants in the Yates case were rightfully convicted and that the Court would have been wrong in reversing as to five of them because those five who, and which the Court even barred a new trial, included people who are very, very active, people who were journalists in charge of Communist press, who were turning out some material that they certainly hoped would sell dissention and blacken the reputation of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.078" offset="13367672">But, the Court said that those were simply lawful activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.046" offset="13383555">The mere fact that a person is active without more doesn't seem to get us anywhere, it seem to me to get us anywhere in terms of constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.470" offset="13417200">Now, it is perfectly true, as Mr. Davis says, that the Prosecution submitted the issue of activity to the jury here -- I mean, the judge did, on the Prosecution's request, but I look at Mr. Davis' brief on page 67 and I see in his brief that he says that it shouldn't have gone to the jury at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.455" offset="13489194">That it ought to have been decided by the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.662" offset="13497971">So, I'm still a little at a lost as to what would have been the proper procedure here under his theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.652" offset="13525974">In connection with this matter of construing the membership clause, I would like to reiterate that the clause contains a prohibition against being an affiliate of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.826" offset="13570696">As far as I know, the Government has never sought to bring a case under that clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.150" offset="13595982">Perhaps there are constitutional worries about it in addition to those in the rest of the clause, but the presence of that, seems to me quite clearly, indicate that Congress did not have this very restricted quasi-military conspirational theory of membership that the Government here is contending for because, certainly, affiliation means some kind of a looser, looser and lesser connection with the organization than membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.874" offset="13698905">And, I note, finally, on this portion of the argument that the Government itself when it is not considering constitutionality but is dealing with what evidence is necessary to support a conviction here, it construes this clause in quite a different, and, it seems to me, a much more satis -- much more reasonable way because when they're dealing with the evidence, they say at page 77 of their brief, that, in a membership case, it suffices to prove that the Party as such, and not necessarily including the defendant, engaged in the forbidden advocacy and that the defendant was a member of the Party with the necessary knowledge and intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3442.390" offset="13872880">77, footnote 33, toward the end.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.649" offset="13890017">So that, when their -- when the Government's mind is not on constitutionality, they put this clause in the very bear terms that we think the statute speaks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.662" offset="13934007">Now, could I just make a comment about the question Justice Black asked about that prohibition statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.609" offset="13961801">Our situation here is I think a harder case to sustain the statute than to sustain the application of the statute here than the one that Justice Black gave.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.994" offset="14011329">We don't have a case here where there is no organization which, in its platform, puts in what you might call an illegal plank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.383" offset="14036929">There's a plank advocating illegality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.505" offset="14045393">If you look at the platform of the Communist Party, you will find not only that they eschew force and violence, but provisions in there for the expulsion of anybody who advocates it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.858" offset="14086771">Now, the Government's theory and evidence they have brought in support of their theory is, of course, that those words in the platform are spurious, Aesopian, the words that's been used, and that there is a secret agreement among the leaders of the Party to preach unlawful incitement to advocate unlawful action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.839" offset="14178722">So that, what we have here is not a case of an openly proclaimed illegal aim, but a secretly advocated illegal aim, if anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.455" offset="14217174">And, that is why this question of connection with the defendant is so important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.033" offset="14235460">If illegal advocacy were in the platform of the Party, you could quite reasonably hold the members to some knowledge of it because this would be a publicly proclaimed aim but, as soon as you depart from that and are talking about some kind of a private and secret agreement among the leaders not reflected in the public announcements then, certainly, the defendant who is tried for membership should not be bound by this -- the secret advocacies unless it is shown that he had knowledge of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.310" offset="14348622">And, that brings us to some of the remarks that my adversary made about schools here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.440" offset="14373177">Justice Harlan asked the date of this new evidence that's come into the case since Yates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.558" offset="14397628">It is quite true that there is evidence about this school in North Carolina in 1952, which the defendant attended, but I think I am right in saying that the evidence about unlawful advocacy, on which the Government chiefly relies, was at other schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.880" offset="14458859">And, it is very difficult to find in the testimony about this school in North Carolina any of this violent advocacy that he quoted some from in connection with these other schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.786" offset="14510477">On the matter of witnesses, Justice Harlan, I do have here the appendix to the Government's brief in the Yates case and it is a fact that Lochner was a common witness in Yates and here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.187" offset="14556139">I believe it also to be a fact that there were no other common witnesses between Yates and Scales, but the other witnesses in Scales were common witnesses with many other Smith Act cases which were disposed of in the lower courts, following this Court's decision in Yates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.284" offset="14616534">They were not new witnesses in the sense of being their testimony about the Party being new and different from what have been testified about in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.225" offset="14660315">I gather that the Government chiefly relies on the circumstance that there was more voluminous testimony about what was said of these schools and perhaps more violent language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.415" offset="14701066">Now, I think the story here is really quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.285" offset="14720502">It's all in the Yates case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.260" offset="14728443">It is quite clear on the Yates record that, after this reconstitution of the Party in 1945 when there was this return to the Doctrines of Marxism and Leninism, there was a great campaign through these Communist schools to what they called reeducation to bring the Party members back to the Doctrines of Marxism and Leninism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.010" offset="14815378">And, most of these statements were made in the course of that so-called reeducation program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.233" offset="14844322">Now, in the record of this case, and I'm sorry about these As and other things that are confusing about the record, the reason for it is, in order to --</text>
