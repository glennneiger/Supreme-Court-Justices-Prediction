            <text syncTime="19.952" offset="183150">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.492" offset="201331">The parties below and the courts below agree that the goods here acquired the status of imports and that until they lose their character as such, they are not subject to the state tax here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.455" offset="257233">We think this means that on the facts which I recited yesterday that Brown and the Hooven case disposed of the matter and that the judgment below must be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.439" offset="313135">The rule is fundamentally the general rule indicated in Brown versus Maryland that imports do not lose their character as such until they are acted upon by the importer in some manner to mix them up with the general property of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.338" offset="376769">That is the general rule and the Chief Justice in that case said that it required that the distinctions be marked as the cases arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.766" offset="414386">But the Chief Justice pointed out in that case that there was a clear situation that plainly meant that the goods were not subject to state tax and it was the kind of tax situation that was presented in that case, and that is that the goods, if they remain the property of the importer and stored in his warehouse in the original package or form in which they were brought in to this country are clearly exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.611" offset="553775">This is the clear or the plain case of immunity that requires no further examination and is one of the most outstanding examples of the general rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.458" offset="597243">We think that this clearly applies in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.352" offset="616782">The goods here were brought into the -- into this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.789" offset="630575">There was no action on the part of the importer.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.419" offset="645099">They were stored in his storage yard and in his warehouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.684" offset="662131">They were not in anyway mixed up with the general mass of property in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.053" offset="695568">This general rule and the more specific one applicable to the facts in this particular case was reiterated in Low versus Austin and was emphatically confirmed by Chief Justice Stone in the Hooven case.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.327" offset="768711">In the Hooven case, this, I think, was made quite clear by Chief Justice Stone when he said that no opinion of this Court has ever said or intimated that imports held by the importer in the original package and before they were subjected to the manufacture for which they are imported are reliable to state taxation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Roger C. Minahan</label>
            <text syncTime="199.467" offset="901204">Until some affirmative action, Your Honor, is taken by the importer to change the form or substance of what he has imported.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.902" offset="955016">And in the Hooven case, Chief Justice Stone called attention to the decision in Low versus Austin which I think further illustrates this particular point, and he quoted from the language in Low versus Austin by Chief Justice Taney in which it was said that goods imported while they remain in the hands of the importer in the form and shape in which they were brought into this country continued to be immune from the state tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.618" offset="1093883">Now, in the Hooven case, the suggestion was made by -- or was more than a suggestion the lower court in Ohio held the goods all subject to tax because they were stored in the warehouse awaiting use, and this was the theory of the Supreme Court of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.248" offset="1180400">And this theory was expressly rejected by the Court in the Hooven case.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.638" offset="1213942">When the State of Wisconsin Supreme Court was confronted with the fact that the awaiting use theory had been completely rejected, they talked about having subjected the goods to manufacturer by a reason of their having been assembled and stored in the warehouse available for use.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.775" offset="1294503">And the Court there says this is tantamount to subjecting the goods to manufacturer and if that they were put to use as much as if they had been dried, heated, reshaped, chemically changed or otherwise changed in form or composition.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.008" offset="1359391">Now, that's what the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, the exact language of what they said in their opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.249" offset="1380394">But this particular approach was completely rejected by this Court in the Hooven case and the language, I think, couldn't have been more clear than Chief Justice Stone put it when he said, and these were his words, and incidentally this -- this was the opening paragraph of the section which the Supreme Court finds dictum there, the Chief Justice said, “It cannot be said that the fibers were subjected to manufacture when they were placed in petitioner's warehouse in their original packaging.”</text>
            <text syncTime="355.436" offset="1525112">Then they go on and they adopt the theory that the current operational needs concept was approved by the dictum in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.661" offset="1565968">This is a dangerous concept in my judgment because I think it would emasculate all of the 130 years of what we have understood that provision of the Constitution to mean, and we don't have to speculate on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.435" offset="1621138">While this, of course, is not in the record in this case, it is perfectly clear that if this concept were adopted with the Courts, it would mean the elimination of any exemption to goods stored in the warehouse even though no change had taken place or it is not surprising to find that in the year following that here involved, the Assessor in Wisconsin taxed all of the goods of this particular petition in a subsequent tax year on the current operational needs theory in spite of the fact that the orders of this petitioner were down in volume, and there were no -- nowhere near the future orders involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.261" offset="1792397">And the stock of imported goods had very materially and substantially increased so that it had a lower order file and a far higher supply of the goods in the warehouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.958" offset="1851225">I would like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin Larkin</label>
            <text syncTime="447.332" offset="1892707">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.162" offset="1912038">I should like to address myself first to the remarks of Mr. Minahan yesterday on the first subject that he took up which has to do with the lumber imported and piled in the yard in Algoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.305" offset="1988629">And Algoma is about 150 miles north of Milwaukee.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.364" offset="2008795">And there is where U.S. Plywood has the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.757" offset="2022379">It has a yard in which this lumber from Canada was unloaded, piled in the yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.584" offset="2057697">Now, that lumber came in green, full of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.141" offset="2079953">Before that lumber could be used in a final finished product, it was necessary the first step that was necessary was to remove the moisture from the lumber.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.011" offset="2143378">That is done in one of two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.380" offset="2152887">The lumber can be kiln dried or -- in a shed or building or it can be air dried.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.399" offset="2184965">Air-drying is much less expensive than kiln-drying.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.168" offset="2204087">Air-drying is what this lumber was being subjected to when it was piled out in the yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.951" offset="2231150">Yes, it was piled in a manner so as to prevent decay.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.473" offset="2253302">But it was piled, and this is a finding of the Court after a full trial, it was piled in that yard with the dominant purpose, the dominant purpose of air-drying that lumber.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.672" offset="2330102">The trial court held and the Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed that at the time that lumber was being air-dried, it was being subjected to manufacture in its first stage.</text>

            <text syncTime="1146.996" offset="4691362">But the Court did brought to the attention, if this is important, that a portion of a new shipment, a few more veneer would be placed on a partially depleted pile of that veneer and could be the first taken for use.</text>

            <text syncTime="1193.824" offset="4878712">The Assessor, special assessor was called under Wisconsin practice for adverse examination and examined by Mr. Minahan for a day and a half at the beginning of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.845" offset="4918732">I called him as my witness, the Assessor, and Mr. Minahan had another opportunity to cross-examine him.</text>

            <text syncTime="1244.464" offset="5081213">But in that sentence, the trial court speaks of the imports required to be on hand to meet the immediate or current needs of a manufacturer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1286.300" offset="5248606">And at page 43, the opinion of the Wisconsin Supreme Court, I say page 43 of the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1336.136" offset="5447868">Speaking of this -- these current operational needs and the raw materials, imported raw materials, trial court said “have so finally come to rest in his plan there to a practical certainty to lose out their identity in a manufactured product”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.928" offset="5527071">That is the trial court's holding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1361.770" offset="5550477">This was not only on the basis of what the Assessor said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.865" offset="5570853">We introduced, and there was a great deal of -- of testimony, and there were exhibits on an entirely different theory, the manufacturing cycle which the trial court speaks of on page 15, that was -- how long it would take a product to go through that operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.812" offset="5654653">And on the basis of those facts, the trial court said, “The manufacturing cycle test”, and that was the respondents, “amply supports the conclusion of the Assessor that one half of the foreign imports on hand May 1st were required to be on hand to the meet plaintiff's immediate needs.”</text>
