            <text syncTime="11.058" offset="147623">On page 99 of the record, the opinion of the Supreme Court of State of New Hampshire, they state -- it appears that the witness, while he does not claim contention here, has pleaded the Fifth Amendment when questioned about Communist matters at Congressional Committee and he was a supporter of numerous organizations on the subversive list prepared by the House Committee and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.898" offset="266951">The -- when we pointed out to the Court that there was no evidence in the record that the appellant had ever taken the Fifth Amendment anywhere and that if he had taken it, it was improper to draw any such inferences from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.683" offset="342079">The matter was deleted from the opinion of the state court on motion for rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.545" offset="365589">However, I think it's significant that the Attorney General here again relies upon it as a basis for some implication about Willard Uphaus as an indication of how thin the case is upon which he is seeking to rely on and indicating a dangerous tendency to waterdown a recognized constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.940" offset="467153">The -- in the matter of the sheriff's list, the right of the sheriff to get names of guests is perfectly obvious that that has no application here.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.016" offset="523473">A sheriff would not go to get the names of guests for the purpose of publicizing name in an invidious manner in relation to subversive activities or alleged subversive activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="149.759" offset="702360">This list, which the Attorney General presents to this Court, some of the known off-sided guests and speakers at World Fellowship is a curious list.</text>

            <text syncTime="305.681" offset="1326059">-- the Attorney General seems to me to have misread the opinions in the Sweezy case, while it is true that the opinion of the Chief Justice must based upon the vagueness of the mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.075" offset="1411636">There was also discussion of the First Amendment rights which seem to me to indicate that those three members or four members of the Court were not in disagreement with the fact that First Amendment rights here might have been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.487" offset="1473285">And certainly, the -- the Chief Justice in his statement, which is quoted on page 18 of our brief, where he says “We cannot -- we do not now conceived of any circumstances where any state interest would justify infringements of rights in this field,” indicates to me clearly that the Attorney General is trying to put too narrow in interpretation upon that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.780" offset="1622497">I think also that he's trying to put too narrow in interpretation upon the opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter in which Mr. Justice Harlan concurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.289" offset="1660531">I do not conceive that in discussing academic freedom, Mr. Justice Frankfurter was limiting the teaching process to the laws of a chartered university.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.563" offset="1705671">Now, that in discussing political association, he was limiting it to the progressive part.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.453" offset="1737226">I think the issue is much broader here with a camp of adult people.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.060" offset="1755617">It's quite obvious that competent people came there as lecturers on various subjects and that this was an adult educational process that was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.470" offset="1809220">And I just can't imagine what danger there could have been to the State of New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.971" offset="1839208">I may say that the Attorney General had a standing invitation to come there and lecture himself, but he is not yet honored that he had complete opportunity, have a representative of his office, attend the meetings there.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.867" offset="1894797">There was nothing secret about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.866" offset="1902843">It was an open discussion by adult people of questions of common interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.830" offset="1934712">And I think that it's perfectly clear, as Mr. Justice Harlan's opinion in the National Association for the Advancement of the Colored People versus Alabama pointed out that this appellant had a right to protect not only his own constitutional rights, but the rights of other persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.413" offset="2021021">Now, the -- the opinion of the court below expresses the thought that not only the correspondence of guest speakers, but the correspondence concerning guest speakers was the subject of this subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.539" offset="2141497">In other words, here, not only where letters which couldn't conceivably, as I think the Attorney General admitted yesterday, couldn't conceivably deal with the overthrow of Government by a force and violence and nobody would write such things in a letter, not only those letters but the correspondence that might be in the files by third or fourth persons concerning these people.</text>
