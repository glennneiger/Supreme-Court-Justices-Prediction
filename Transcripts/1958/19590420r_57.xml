            <text syncTime="29.749" offset="222333">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.242" offset="236335">In this case which is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, the immunity question relates not to the dissemination of information to the press, but to the dissemination of information by a member of the executive branch or the legislative branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.812" offset="314598">The petitioner in this case, Admiral Howard, is the Commanding Officer of the Boston Navy Shipyard.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.377" offset="340929">The alleged libel in this case consisted of the transmission by Admiral Howard to members of the Massachusetts Congressional Delegation of copies of a report which he sent to his two superiors in the Navy Department in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.685" offset="410102">The report explains the reasons why Admiral Howard was withdrawing recognition from a Veterans Employees Group that was operating at the navy shipyard.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.313" offset="460675">The two respondents in this case were two officials of that organization.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="95.610" offset="485857">The Admiral was a Captain at that time wasn't he?</text>

          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="97.678" stopTime="362.441">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="97.678" offset="494111">Yes he was, he is now a Rear Admiral.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.351" offset="508740">The Court of Appeals in this case held that Admiral Howard had an absolute privilege in sending the report to his two superior officials in Washington and both felt that he did not lose his privilege in transmitting a copy of the report to his immediate military commander, the commanding officer of the first naval district, even though he knew that under normal practice in that area this report would be made available to the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.753" offset="626395">However, the Court held that when Admiral Howard also sent a copy of these -- his report to members of the Massachusetts Congressional Delegation, he lost his absolute privilege and he had only a qualified privilege with respect to that publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.373" offset="700897">The association in this case, the Shipyard Employees Association had been in 1949 recognized as an accredited employee representative at the Boston Naval Shipyard and in accordance with the accepted navy industrial relations procedure the shipyard administration had met with these groups and conducted various employee relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.493" offset="805386">After a time the administration of the shipyard concluded that the activities of this association were becoming increasingly disruptive of good shipyard administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.087" offset="851675">They found particularly objectionable, a series of newsletters that the association was publishing, was distributing to its members and also transmitting to members of the Massachusetts Congressional Delegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.871" offset="906846">In fact after one of these things had been transmitted to the Massachusetts Congressional Delegation, so an investigation conducted by the navy department of the administration of the shipyard, and finally in September 1955, Admiral Howard decided to withdraw recognition from this organization and the alleged libel in this case is set forth in the record at page 8 to 15, and that is the report which he submitted to his superiors.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.022" offset="1067447">There are in this -- in the record in this case, two affidavits which have not been contraverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.730" offset="1094301">The first is an affidavit by Admiral Howard which is set forth at pages 22 and 23, in which he states that in the course of his official duties, he was advised that the charges made against the administration by this organization had been transmitted to the members of the Boston -- of Massachusetts Congressional Delegation and he further stated that the paragraph 5 of the affidavit, at page 22 of the record he stated, in the course of my official duty as commander of Boston Navy Shipyard and in conformance with navy department policy of keeping members of Congress informed of matters in which they have an official interest, he sent copies of his report to all members of the Massachusetts Congressional Delegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.464" offset="1297220">Now Admiral Howard's immediate military superior, Admiral Schnakenberg also put an affidavit in this case, set forth at pages 20 to 21, in paragraph five of that affidavit Admiral Schnakenberg stated that included among Admiral Howard's official duty as Commander of the Boston Naval Shipyard was the furnishing of copies to the Massachusetts Congressional Delegation of his official notification to the Bureau of Ships, personal action taken by him as Commander of the Boston Naval Shipyard.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.538" offset="1437550">Now when Admiral Howard decided that he had to withdraw recognition from this organization because of the problems that was creating in the shipyard, clearly he was required to report that under navy regulations to his superiors and there doesn't seem to be any questions in this case that the transmission of this official report gave him immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="369.847" offset="1582791">It's not questioned that in this case the members of the Massachusetts Congressional Delegation were deeply concerned with what was going on at the Boston Navy Shipyard and the affidavit of Admiral Schnakenberg, not here contraverted, states that one of the duties of Admiral Howard the petition here was to send copies of this report to the concerned Massachusetts Congressional Delegation.</text>

            <text syncTime="437.692" offset="1854151">That seems to be the opinion of the Court, because they don't discuss the affidavit of Admiral Schnakenberg in their opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.568" offset="1881631">They do discuss the defendant that is Admiral Howard's affidavit saying keeping with navy department policy and the course of his official duties, but it seems to me that the affidavit of his direct superior there was part of his official duties, to me means something more than merely this was one of the things which he had discretion to accomplish.</text>

            <text syncTime="485.068" offset="2043695">No he did not, there is -- there had been issued a policy directive of the Secretary of the Navy which in rather general terms say it was the duty of all naval installations to keep their local congressional delegations informed of what was taking place with respect of matters in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.936" offset="2131153">The Court of Appeals in reaching this conclusion recognized, as I have indicated previously in my argument in the Thor case, that the policy behind the granting of absolute immunity, page 38 of the record in the Howard case, is not to protect wicked defendant from the normal civil liabilities for the publication of defamatory statements maliciously and in bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.628" offset="2241912">Rather the policy is to further what is deemed to be the greater public interest in ensuring the consciences public official complete freedom in the exercise of their duty without the inhibiting fear of possible (Inaudible) in which they would have to satisfy a jury of their own good faith, and carrying out that policy the Court held that Admiral Howard had an absolute protection, not a qualified privilege, an absolute privilege with respect to sending of these reports to his superior officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.735" offset="2374301">We don't think that a distinction can fairly be drawn in this case between his duty to send the report to his superiors and his duty to send it to the members of the Massachusetts Congressional Delegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.114" offset="2435845">This is not a case in which Admiral Howard fortuitously decided that this was a matter that might generally be of interest to the members of Congress and volunteered to send it.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.862" offset="2486836">He stated and it is not controverted that he was aware that the members of this organization had brought to the attention of the Massachusetts Congressional Delegation, their charges against the shipyard and in the circumstances, it was necessary and carrying out his duties in navy policy, that the members of the Massachusetts Congressional Delegation be kept informed of this significant step being taken at the naval shipyard, that is withdrawing recognition to this group which had been a considerable thorn in the side of the administration.</text>

            <text syncTime="917.172" offset="3772061">So that in this case, the organization involved itself had taken the initiative in widely publicizing these charges and Admiral Howard also stated in his report and in his affidavit that these charges had not only been brought to the attention of the Massachusetts Congressional Delegation, but has been widely distributed to the press, both of wire services and the Boston newspapers, and there has been an investigation of some of these charges by the navy department, a report of that investigation similarly had been transmitted to the Congressional delegation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1521.191" offset="6188178">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.682" offset="6206151">First at outset in this case, I want to say that the cases which have granted absolute immunity are the cases of a libel, have been limited to members of the cabinet who have policy making powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.990" offset="6331329">I know of no cases, except to the heads of the departments where they have been granted absolute immunity unless they had public policy making power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.752" offset="6410428">A case of that (Inaudible) was decided solely on the question of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.463" offset="6445223">I know that, because I was a counsel for the plaintiff in that case, and I argued that case before the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.352" offset="6500812">The immunity which was granted to Mr. (Inaudible) in that case, was based solely upon the fact that the libel press release which he had issued in that case was sent to press under the signature of Secretary of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.932" offset="6619094">That case was argued before -- one of the judges was Judge Truman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.970" offset="6651277">The comment of Judge Truman is shown on page five of my brief, in which he holds and while he concurs in the opinion sustaining the question of immunity from libel in that case, he says that he thinks that the courts have gone too far in granting immunity to public officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.696" offset="6790144">I think the courts have gone entirely too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.603" offset="6805817">Why should any public official be privileged to libel, any public, any citizen of the United States?</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.901" offset="6850957">It is true that the officer who holds a job position such as Secretary of Interior or other member of the cabinet should have a certain amount of immunity, but when he departs from that and fortuitously, maliciously, wickedly and issues a libel, he should be responsible for to same as any other official of the -- or any other person, American citizen of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.228" offset="7024306">Now there is point that hasn't been argued in this -- they haven't touched upon in this, before this Court, and I want to bring it to your attention, it is covered in our brief, filed in this case and that is the question of whether the statements contained in the libel communication are domains to the subject matter.</text>
