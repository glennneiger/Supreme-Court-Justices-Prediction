            <label>Mr. George J. Francis</label>
            <text syncTime="20.980" offset="187329">Mr. Chief Justice Warren, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.304" offset="216586">The case before this Honorable Court this afternoon involves a rather simple point which came up in a criminal trial which I've been appointed by the Court to defend the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.598" offset="297775">The salient point before this Honorable Court is whether or not the reading by jurors during the course of trial, that is to say after the trial has commenced, whether the reading by jurors of newspaper articles which set forth a defamatory matter about the criminal defendant which defamatory matter includes statements as to previous criminal convictions, includes statements that the defendant's wife had been involved in similar charges, tried and convicted in the same court and sentenced to jail, include statements that the defendant had prescribed restricted drugs for a -- at that time well known senior who shortly thereafter died and few other statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.060" offset="575613">The case rose under a charge that the defendant was guilty of indiscriminate dispensing of drugs without prescription, the drug being commonly known as Dexedrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.950" offset="643218">The defendant never took a stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.196" offset="652204">The defendant did not present testimony of his own but rather relied upon cross-examination of the Government's witnesses in an attempt to challenge the burden of proof that was been on the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.369" offset="744887">In a very few words, the testimony was predominantly that of the government agent who testified that after having been introduced socially to the defendant, he approached him on two occasions -- approached the defendant on two occasions, concealing his identity and announcing to him that he had a long automobile trip to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.452" offset="853138">One from Denver, Colorado to Dallas, Texas in one evening and two, this is on subsequent occasion, a drive by automobile from Denver to California.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.645" offset="929938">The government agent requested stay-awake pills as he termed them and after some discussion on the initial approach to the defendant when the defendant recommended no dose and coffee to keep him awake, the government agent did received according to the testimony the dextro amphetamine sulfate, commonly termed Dexedrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.868" offset="1066820">As I have stated, the defendant did not take a stand, he did not present evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.368" offset="1084792">He did not submit witnesses of his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.484" offset="1105272">However, through cross-examination of the plaintiff's witnesses predominantly the government agent rather close cross-examination and very careful cross-examination, the trial court grant an instruction to the defendant on entrapment.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.990" offset="1203284">The issue of entrapment was submitted to the jury as an issue of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.362" offset="1232854">The Government after they had rested their case and having realize that an instruction on entrapment was to be given based upon only the Government's case sought to reopen for permission to submit further testimony on rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.239" offset="1316342">That is to say that they had grounds that would justify the entrapment.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.148" offset="1339956">The Court considered the implication rather unusual because of the fact that a rebuttal was being asked for where the defendant had not presented the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.351" offset="1400769">However, the Court refused rebuttal on the grounds that the evidence that the Government was seeking to introduce was actually not relevant that is to say the Court was saying you have not shown me that this defendant was engaged in similar dispensing of drugs in this relevant period.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.585" offset="1505677">Entrapment instruction was given and rebuttal was not had.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.214" offset="1532217">Then in a few words is the summoned substance of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.259" offset="1564400">The matters of which the petitioner complains of here rose after the first day of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.279" offset="1596479">After the government agent and a few others had testified, the Court recessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.166" offset="1632005">The next morning, defendant's counsel namely myself having observed several newspapers in the jury room itself and having been informed that the --</text>

            <text syncTime="435.904" offset="1846941">And defendant's counsel requested that the jurors be interrogated for the purpose of determining whether or not the newspaper articles had been read.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.605" offset="1901798">The court granted the request of defendant's counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.121" offset="1927816">And on individual interrogation of the jurors, it was discovered that 6 of the 12 had read one or the other of the newspaper articles at pages 52 and 53 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.165" offset="2008064">The newspaper articles themselves are set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.594" offset="2025723">If I may read portions of those two articles, the one article in which four had read stated first the matters about what had happened during the course of trial in the previous date.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.722" offset="2090297">Then at the bottom, the last two paragraphs, the newspaper articles stated Marshall has a record of two previous felony convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.823" offset="2126660">In 1953, while serving a forgery sentence in the State Penitentiary at McAlester, Oklahoma, Marshall testified before a state legislative committee studying new drug laws for Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.659" offset="2173994">At that time, he told the committee that although he had only a high school education, he practiced medicine with a $25 diploma he received through the mails.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.222" offset="2212237">He told in detail of the ease in which he wrote the past prescriptions for dangerous drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.313" offset="2236583">The other newspaper article, The Denver Post which is an afternoon and evening paper, stated in part, “The defendant was Howard R.(Tobey) Marshall, once identified before a committee of the Oklahoma Legislature as a man who acted as a physician and prescribed restricted drugs for Hank Williams before the country singer's death in December, 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.529" offset="2341491">Marshall was arrested with his wife, Edith Every Marshall, 56, in June, 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.180" offset="2364061">She was convicted on the drug charges in Federal District Court here in November and was sentenced to 60 days in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.510" offset="2389452">Records show that Marshall once served a term in the Oklahoma penitentiary for forgery.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.746" offset="2410350">There is no evidence he is a doctor, court attaches said."</text>
            <text syncTime="585.091" offset="2443786">The request of the defendant's counsel, the jurors being brought in to determine whether or not they have read the articles and it's being determined that a number of them have through rather torturous at least on what I considered in my part rather delicate attempt to examine several of the jurors, not all.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.713" offset="2550262">And under interrogation from the Government attorneys and from the District Court itself, the jurors all stated very firmly that they had not been prejudiced by the reading and that they could continue with the course of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.570" offset="2633644">The defendant's counsel made a motion from mistrial at the termination of examination of the jurors and that motion for mistrial was denied, the Court stating that in effect, it felt that the jurors through their demeanor and because of their statements were not prejudiced and could continue with the course of the trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2136.561" offset="8649644">One as to the discretion of the trial court in denying a motion for new trial and the second, the discretion of the trial court in withdrawing a juror which was a matter that hit -- been handled by the Holt case namely that a juror was not withdrawn and that was an error alleged by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.000" offset="8731355">But the juror was not withdrawn, not because of the reading of the newspaper but because of something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.385" offset="8784959">And if I may elucidate just a little more on the Holt decision, Justice Holmes says, “The judge did not reject the affidavit,” but decided against the motion on the assumption that more than it ventured to allege was true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.555" offset="8857579">And I submit the rational explanation of that that more than it ventured to allege was true was simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.502" offset="8897390">The affidavit ventured to allege that cert -- that newspaper articles had been read, but he -- the affiant couldn't say which ones, hoping that he could somehow induce the trial court to get the jurors in court and find out which ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.192" offset="8976175">More than it ventured to allege means that it ventures to allege that certain -- that articles were read without being able to say in the affidavit which ones and the court would not assume that the detrimental ones were the ones that had been read.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.716" offset="9058200">Actually, the Holt case came up because until that point, he was doubtful whether or not a jury was permitted to separate in a capital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.422" offset="9097070">And the Holt case or the Federal Circuits disposed of that question by saying that it was permissible in capital cases to permit the jury to separate and that the court had discretion to permit the jury to separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.314" offset="9160600">In this instance, it did not abuse its discretion in permitting the jury to separate nor did it abuse its discretion for denying a motion for new trial, the grounds of which was that the court had permitted the jury to separate.</text>
