            <text syncTime="58.486" offset="337272">The Court of every one of these jurors asked three basic questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.834" offset="366738">One, did the newspaper article raised any prejudice in the juror's mind?</text>
            <text syncTime="73.257" offset="396413">Was there anything in the article that would influence the juror in considering the case and in rendering his verdict?</text>
            <text syncTime="83.688" offset="438105">And lastly, he asked the juror if he was sure that he could try the case, make up his mind on what should be done from the evidence which he heard from the witness stand, and give no consideration whatsoever to the newspaper articles.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.440" offset="521174">The answers to these questions satisfied the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="117.159" offset="571956">Well, there was -- we have in our brief the case of United States versus Montgomery which indicates that it isn't necessarily the answers or the responses which the Court gets but it get -- but that -- it is -- it's the opportunity to observe these jurors to see them as they answer the questions, to hear how they answer them that is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.452" offset="697135">And in that case, Judge (Inaudible) concluded that although all of the answers had been more or less -- had been favorable there, he nevertheless granted a mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.548" offset="765576">It's a District Court case and it's found in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.645" offset="777906">The citation is 42 F.2d 254.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.695" offset="794102">In this -- this newspaper article identified the defendant with another accused, swindler.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.446" offset="821164">Described the defendant as a swindler, a jailbird, a disbarred attorney, an ex-convict and a fugitive from justice and gave other damaging details about his career.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.375" offset="864841">And three or four of the jurors had read the article.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.316" offset="888665">The -- the Court said that, one, the three of the four who read the article stated that they could deal with the case on the evidence but the other one seemed to answer uncertainly and inconclusively.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.560" offset="949582">And since one juror had asked another if he had read the article, the judge had the uneasy feeling that the others might also read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.991" offset="995349">He got that impression from -- from seeing and observing these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.600" offset="1017814">And he said the motion cannot therefore be answered by basing the decision on the letter of the juror's answers to my questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.098" offset="1055744">I must consider the impression which the jurors made on me when they answered these questions and also the nature of the malignancy and infection to which the jurors have been exposed thus taking into account the article itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="323.790" offset="1398575">Another juror said the same thing, “I glanced at the headline and scanned it as I sometimes do and that was all I saw.”</text>
            <text syncTime="337.485" offset="1453328">Another juror said, “I didn't really digest either one of them very thoroughly.”</text>
            <text syncTime="343.270" offset="1476420">And Mrs. (Inaudible) said, “I scanned it over but I couldn't tell you now what the details were.”</text>
            <text syncTime="350.387" offset="1504946">And some of the jurors also answered indicating that they knew it was their duty to decide this case from the evidence which they received in court and not from outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.166" offset="1556041">And Mrs. (Inaudible) said, “The only thing he told me was that the jury had been selected and so many women and so many men said,” and he said, “I suppose this means you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1281.506" offset="5229380">Now, I submit that this Court in Remmer versus the United States followed essentially this -- this procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.127" offset="5291865">In that case, if the Court recalls, the cases came up in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.885" offset="5330944">During the trial an unnamed person communicated with the juror and remarked that he could profit by bringing in a verdict favorable to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.635" offset="5373889">The incident was reported to the judge and discussed it with the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.733" offset="5394265">An FBI investigation was set on for the bureau did investigate and the judge and the prosecutor concluded that the remark was made in just and nothing further was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.261" offset="5444420">Defense counsel learned of this after the verdict and move for a new trial contending that they would have requested a replacement of the juror had they been aware of this occurrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.312" offset="5488619">This Court held that any private communication or contact or tampering directly or indirectly with the juror during a trial about the matter pending before the jury is deemed presumptively prejudicial if not made in pursuance of known rules and instructions and directions of the court with full knowledge of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.691" offset="5574092">From the record, the court -- this Court could not know what transpire the sending of an FBI agent into the midst of the trial to investigate a juror was considered conduct which was bound to impress the juror and apt to do so unduly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.454" offset="5637204">The trial court -- this Court held that the trial court should not decide and take final action ex parte on such information but should determine the circumstances of the impact thereof upon the juror and whether or not it was prejudicial in a hearing with all interested parties permitted to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.940" offset="5719124">It was remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.029" offset="5727483">The trail court held such a hearing but restricted it to whether or not what effect the FBI inquiry would have on the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.323" offset="5776697">This Court found that the trial courts interpretation of the mandate was too narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.010" offset="5807417">However, they concluded there was sufficient evidence to permit this Court to decide the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.894" offset="5838973">Now, in this case, the facts showed that the juror felt that money was involved otherwise why would have the question have been put to him by his acquaintance and a friend of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.864" offset="5886830">The FBI had told him they were interviewing relative to the conversation to see whether there was anything to it or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.943" offset="5915146">He had mentioned to two other jurors that there was a question as to whether he'd been approached and said he had been under a terrific pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.874" offset="5954853">Now, in applying these facts, the Court remanded it for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.591" offset="5981706">It said it was quite evident from the evidence that he was a disturbed and troubled man from the date of the contact until after the trial and that proper concern for protecting the integrity of the jury system dictated against speculating that the FBI interview dispersed the cloud created by the communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.794" offset="6062582">Moreover, the juror was never certain or never aware of the Government's interpretation of the events to which he was a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.263" offset="6092466">And therefore, they felt that he had been subjected to extraneous influences to which no juror should be subjected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.588" offset="6121723">Now, I submit that in this case, this Court has done exactly what we are contending and send it back to the trial judge to find the facts and to get his interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.374" offset="6176893">The trial judge miss -- unfortunately misinterpreted the court's mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.789" offset="6198523">But there were sufficient facts from which this Court then itself could apply the law to the question --</text>

            <text syncTime="1543.914" offset="6278980">Well, I -- I would think there that even in such case it made no difference, Your Honor because of the instruction on entrapment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.355" offset="6308760">In order for this to have operated on the minds of the jury, there would have been something in the instruction concerning the predisposition of the party to commit -- of the defendant to commit the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.285" offset="6356511">Now, in that instruction -- the entrapment instruction, there was no such instruction with regard to the disposition of the party to commit the offense and in this respect, I would respectfully request the Court to compare the instruction on the entrapment in this case with the instruction which was given in the Sherman case last year, Number 87 at the 1957 term and with the instruction given in the Masciale case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.140" offset="6499976">In both of those cases, they went into the question of whether an instructive or whether the defendant was ready and willing without persuasion, was he weighing a promiscuous opportunity to -- to commit the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.310" offset="6556609">Now, here, no such instruction was given because of the fact that there was no evidence in the case of prior offenses or prior disposition to commit the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.012" offset="6607391">And so therefore, the Court got the -- the jury got the charge without any charge concerning predisposition and therefore there is nothing upon which this could operate they didn't know about that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.662" offset="6674056">That's our position with respect to that of course we argue -- we feel that the facts in this case clearly showed that there was no entrapment as a matter of law and that the issue should have been taken away from the jury and never submit it to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.174" offset="6748035">So that therefore he isn't injured in anyway because he couldn't take advantage of an instruction to which he was not entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.627" offset="6825880">Now, in this case, we have a clear record of questioning of the jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.188" offset="6896097">We have the juror's own impressions, their own statements of their own as to their mind as to their ability to try this case fairly and impartial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.100" offset="6939773">We have the judge's observation of those jurors which he concluded that they would be able to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.605" offset="6977808">He said all of them satisfied me that they would not be influenced in any way about the item.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.048" offset="7003512">It should proceed and render a fair and impartial verdict from the evidence and the law in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.467" offset="7029217">I think the concerns of the jurors was very apparent form their answers and their demeanor while they were here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.315" offset="7060668">And I feel very confident in my own mind that the matter having been called to their attention that they will lean over backwards as a matter of fact in consideration of the case and stay away from any extraneous matter they have -- may have read or heard or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.375" offset="7144887">He further stated, of course, I propose when the instructions come to reiterate that they should not give any consideration to anything they have read or heard or anything else and should confine their consideration solely to the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.631" offset="7209880">Now, we have printed in our brief on page 7, the charge of the jury in its -- to the jury in the court's final instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.291" offset="7284485">Now, the court said, “Now the arguments of counsel and the remarks of court, the court has made during the course of the trial are not evidence and should not be considered by you as evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.297" offset="7344567">The evidence that you are to consider in this case is the testimony you have heard from the witness stand and the exhibits which have been admitted into evidence by the court and your deliberation should consider no other circumstances whatsoever and should not go beyond the consideration of the evidence that you have actually heard and the exhibits that you will have opportunity to examine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.504" offset="7449370">So they were cautioned again at the end of case about what they were to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.703" offset="7478209">Now, Your Honor please, this is only one of the numerous incidents in which we have to apply the question of whether there will be prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.627" offset="7541844">It may come in at the point when you are picking a jury pretrial publicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.680" offset="7570056">You may have prejudicial publicity at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.271" offset="7584475">And yet jurors are not automatically withdrawn for cost where they have read or heard pretrial publicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.183" offset="7636093">It's not an automatic rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.627" offset="7641840">They question the jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.869" offset="7646856">They've argue the jurors to find out whether they can be unbiased and impartial and if voir dire here shows that they can put aside what they have heard, put aside what they read, render a verdict on the basis of what they hear from the lips of the witness, they are acceptable as jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.187" offset="7740165">We have cases -- we're doing the trial of the case, evidence is improperly admitted and later stricken from the record in all of those cases proper admonition to the jury is considered sufficient particularly where the judge and even there, you don't even voir dire the jurors to find out whether they'd be affected by the -- by what came out in the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2775.047" offset="11203584">The counsel for the Government indicates in his statements that the article is prejudicial in itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.233" offset="11240260">Now, on the face of it, now it's hard to examine the mind of a jury especially from a record as brief as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.031" offset="11271502">I've tried to go into that yesterday evening, I would like to call the Court's attention to what the Government counsel referred to as one of the three questions as an indication of how agreeable the jury was to give any answer that would not show that they had prejudiced in their mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.734" offset="11378291">The purpose of that is to show in one instance how ridiculous their position was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.228" offset="11408280">The Court asked, most of those who read this one question, was there anything in that articles that would prejudice you against the defendant?</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.841" offset="11458748">Well it would seem to me the obvious answer is yes there is something in that article that would prejudice but I am not prejudiced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.166" offset="11496051">But all of them, very flat-footedly said why there is nothing in that article that would prejudice mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.271" offset="11528443">On the face of it, that's an impossible position because reading the article, no person could fail but to see that the article in its very nature was of a prejudicial sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.135" offset="11579956">As to how reliable the jury is again we only have a very brief record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.346" offset="11604720">But the Government counsel refers to one party who didn't read the newspaper at all and he is not counted as one of the six who read because her statement was, I scanned it, and therefore in the petitioner's count hypnosis she was omitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.265" offset="11700433">But listen to how reliable the jury is herself at page 44 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.964" offset="11731257">Mrs. (Inaudible), the only thing he told me was that the jury has been selected and so many women and so many men and he said I suppose this means you, this is the case you are on and he didn't tell me anything further than that and he knew that I'm not suppose to read newspaper pieces and I glanced at the headlines of it and scanned it.</text>
