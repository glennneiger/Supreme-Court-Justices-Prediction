            <text syncTime="48.200" offset="296208">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.643" offset="317942">I think in this case, there is very little dispute between us as to the essential facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.288" offset="348557">I have disagreed very hardly with some of the inferences as to this man's conduct prior to death as stated by Mr. Vogel.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.675" offset="390040">I think also it can be said that there is no argument between us as to the applicable North Dakota substantive law.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.945" offset="427133">The law of North Dakota is that proof of death by gunshot wound aided by the presumption against suicide creates a prima facie case, that is the law of North Dakota as enunciated in the four cases that counsel has referred to and set forth in the Svihovec case which Judge Sanborn in his opinion expressly referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.197" offset="528175">Now, under that rule a verdict for a plaintiff in this type of case will not be set aside unless the facts and circumstances cannot be reconciled with any reasonable theory of accidental death.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norman_g_tenneson" startTime="130.229" stopTime="303.662">
            <label>Mr. Norman G. Tenneson</label>
            <text syncTime="130.229" offset="624306">I did endeavor to convince the trial court that the North Dakota rule was not the best rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.643" offset="653981">I endeavor to convince the trial court that once we had offered credible evidence indicating suicide that the presumption fell out of the case and should not be referred to in the instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.133" offset="699956">That I believe is the better rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.403" offset="708942">The rule sponsored by both Professor Wigmore and Professor Morgan but unfortunately, to our view, it is not the law of North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.276" offset="748440">Our contention, of course, here is that the facts and circumstances as disclosed here are consistent only with suicide and wholly inconsistent with accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.495" offset="805386">Now, counsel has drawn in his argument numerous inferences which I think are based on little foundation of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.670" offset="846033">I, of course, concede the right of counsel to draw inferences but as the Court of Appeals in its decision said that the plaintiff is not entitled to the benefit of inferences which are unreasonable or which are opposed to the undisputed facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.348" offset="924714">I think that is sound to all.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.831" offset="934745">Now, I think when you've boil this case down, what you've got here as far as the plaintiff is concerned is only two ultimate facts, namely, the insured is death.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.790" offset="978526">And second, none of the usual motifs that appear in these types of cases is present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.373" offset="1008828">The evidence did indicate some ill health on the part of this insured.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.233" offset="1032338">He was troubled with prostate, land trouble that he felt helpless, not well that he was in some pain.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.856" offset="1070791">The testimony is clear that he went to his family physician during the months of September, October, November and December preceding his death on January 20, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.677" offset="1134111">His wife testified that she knew of only two trips to the doctor and the family has closely met as counsel has indicated this family is with such a fine seating back and fort between the parents and the children, the neighbors and everybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.435" offset="1209135">It's somewhat inconceivable that this man would not disclose to his wife the six of the trips.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.815" offset="1234631">Now, I conceive that certainly, this travel he had is not of such a nature that it would ordinarily lead a man to commit suicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.221" offset="1276217">But I think it is argued that perhaps, he regarded this illness much more seriously than he was justified in doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.181" offset="1316133">Now --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="303.662" stopTime="308.750">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="303.662" offset="1318013">What did the doctor say about -- about the seriousness of it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norman_g_tenneson" startTime="308.750" stopTime="423.266">
            <label>Mr. Norman G. Tenneson</label>
            <text syncTime="308.750" offset="1338389">Oh, he said, he had a mild to moderate nonspecific prostatitis, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.215" offset="1360227">Then he said he had a certain amount of pain with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.216" offset="1380185">Well, he has certain discomfort but I don't think I can fairly say that this was a serious illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.675" offset="1422085">He was a farmer and customized whom to sitting on tractor seats and he had trouble in his back, in the area of his back.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.240" offset="1452283">The doctor did give him hormone injections and as I recall the testimony put him on sulfa therapy.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.100" offset="1479764">But the man came in and I think the doctor's testimony is the last time in December that it was a windy and a cold day and he said he probably had some aches and pains in his back and that's the reason he came in.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.809" offset="1538591">Now, the plaintiff here naturally has made much of the absence of some of the usual motifs which are common in the suicide cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.150" offset="1588015">As the courts have said, a motif, of course, is helpful to the defendant naturally but it is not essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.474" offset="1625318">That is the holding of the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.197" offset="1632110">And I think it is common knowledge and as the Court say that men who have no known motif to commit suicide perhaps there is always a motif but it is not always disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.306" offset="1684564">Now, I hope -- I think you noticed in the argument that counsel made the statement, “He may have done this.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.279" offset="1708492">He might have done this.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.340" offset="1712776">It's likely that he did that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="404.877" offset="1722911">Now, that seems to me that makes a weak case on the part of the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.652" offset="1746004">The plaintiff has the burden of showing how this accident occurred if this was an accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.415" offset="1768991">Seems to me that you are entitled to something more here than bare conjecture as to what might have happen.</text>

            <text syncTime="483.964" offset="2039202">I think on our part, as I will attempt to demonstrate later, that there are certain, essential facts here which are proven and which, in our view, are consistent only with suicide and wholly inconsistent with accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.706" offset="2098239">Now, what are the undisputed facts here?</text>
            <text syncTime="503.367" offset="2116838">As I view, perhaps counsel will disagree with me or the Court may disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.870" offset="2134810">But we do have testimony from the wife, the brother, the nephew and the other relatives that William Dick was an experienced hunter.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.778" offset="2178487">We're not dealing here with a man that was not familiar with firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.331" offset="2196668">He had hunted practically every fall since 1926.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.847" offset="2218715">He had hunted for pheasants, ducks, geese and deer.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.130" offset="2239927">That's not uncommon in our part of the country where game is quite plentiful.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.768" offset="2262392">He was very thoroughly familiar with shotguns and how they operate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.755" offset="2278379">He had owned this gun for 26 years after all.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.823" offset="2290709">And the testimony by his wife and his brothers is uncontradicted that he was careful in the handling of firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.740" offset="2326340">He was not a careless man.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.884" offset="2338879">The gun he owned, the gun that caused his death was the only gun that he owns.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.569" offset="2357687">Testimony is undisputed that he was a husky, strong man and the doctor said that he would do his regular farm work in spite of the misery that he was having from this prostate trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.245" offset="2412335">Now, I think it's important here to consider the gun that is here on evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.643" offset="2437935">What kind of a gun is it?</text>
            <text syncTime="584.844" offset="2442742">Well, it's a 12-gauge, Stevens, double-barrel.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.872" offset="2474820">And when you break the gun, insert the shells in here close that breech, this gun is automatically unsafe.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.321" offset="2516616">You cannot fire both triggers.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.092" offset="2527692">And to guide the hunter, there's an S above this little button here on this top.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.983" offset="2551306">In order to fire both triggers, you have to do something.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.679" offset="2570115">You have to push this button forward and take it off safe, then you may fire both triggers.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.135" offset="2599894">You break the gun again when you insert shell, do it again, that gun is unsafe.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.565" offset="2625599">So it is obvious that this gun must have been taken off safe otherwise it would not have fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.006" offset="2667395">And as was asked earlier in the argument, the front trigger fires the right barrel.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.245" offset="2700309">The rear trigger fires the left barrel.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.015" offset="2715460">I think that is common in practically all shotguns although some of the modern ones, you could select what trigger you want to push if you're fast enough to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.059" offset="2759659">Now, immediately after this death was reported, the sheriff in the corner came out to this little farm, found this man lying in what is known in the evidence as a silage shed.</text>
