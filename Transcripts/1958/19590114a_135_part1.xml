            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 135, Billy G. Woody, Petitioner, versus United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.678" offset="218049">Mr. Woolsey, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Clarence O. Woolsey</label>
            <text syncTime="30.303" offset="224632">Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.463" offset="241246">This case involves the violation of the National Motor Vehicle Theft Act, the Dyer Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.236" offset="284296">Billy Woody, the petitioner, was convicted in the U.S.District Court for the Western District of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.525" offset="333511">The question that is presented under his conviction is whether or not he can be given a five year sentence for transporting a stolen automobile and an additional five years sentence to be served consequently for receiving and concealing the same automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.624" offset="437896">Now, the statutes are -- that are involved are 18 U.S.C.Section 2312, which is Section 3 of the Act, which concerns the transporting and which provides for a maximum sentence of five years or a fine of $5000 or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.711" offset="538206">Section 2313, which is Section 4 of the Act, imposes similar penalties for whoever receives, conceals, stores, barters, sells or disposes of a stolen vehicle which is moving in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.210" offset="632247">On June the 24th, 1954, the petitioner was tried before a jury and the indictment charging him with the crime contained two counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.408" offset="688985">Count one stated that on or about the 16th of March, 1954, Billy G.Woody transported in interstate commerce a certain Buick automobile which it described from Sheffield, Alabama to Savannah, Tennessee knowing it to be stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.613" offset="773831">The second count of the indictment stated that on or about March the 16th, the same date in 1954, the petitioner received and concealed the same automobile, which was then moving in interstate commerce between Sheffield, Alabama and Savannah, Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.893" offset="870902">The jury found him guilty on both counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.447" offset="889187">He was sentenced five years on the first count and fined $125.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.089" offset="915728">He was sentenced five years on the second count and fined $125 with the sentences to be served consecutively.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.266" offset="968391">Now, on January the 12th, 1957, over three years later, this petitioner applied to the District Court for permission to proceed as a pauper on a motion to vacate the excess sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.419" offset="1041011">The District Court dismissed that motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.158" offset="1060028">The petitioner appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit where the motion was denied because the petitioner's contention that multiple punishments had been inflicted, had long since been decided otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.894" offset="1138918">The memorandum opinion of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals assumed and conceded that this was one transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.532" offset="1181550">The petitioner's application for writ of certiorari of October 21st, 1957 was granted by this Court on June the 30th, 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.658" offset="1230033">As we stated, the memorandum opinion of the Sixth Circuit assumed and conceded that the petitioner's conduct was a single continuous act.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.598" offset="1265768">We contend that it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.652" offset="1277994">We contend further that even though the Dyer Act defines several punishments that when one continuous force of conduct by one person results in a violation of more than one section of that statute, that Congress did not intend that multiple cumulative punishment should be inflicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.800" offset="1374542">That since there is only one course of conduct involved, Congress did not intend for punishment to be pyramided and the cumulative punishment inflicted upon the petitioner was therefore erroneous under the cases of this Court dealing with the fragmentation of crimes for the purpose of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.711" offset="1470255">The applicable provisions of the Dyer Act are now substantially the same as they were when they were first enacted, aircraft had been added.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.726" offset="1514245">Now, this Act was specifically designed to punish the person who transported a stolen automobile in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.264" offset="1560430">The statements made by Representative Igoe and Representative Dyer as well as by Senator Cummins, when this Act was discussed in Congress, indicate that it was aimed at the transportation of automobiles, stolen automobiles in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.833" offset="1642663">And in addition to that, the short title to the Act since 1940 has read, “An Act to punish for the transportation of stolen motor vehicles or aircraft in interstate or foreign commerce”.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.480" offset="1709328">The statements of the member of Congress in the discussion of this legislation are mentioned in our briefs and also mentioned in the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.964" offset="1751228">It's our contention that they clearly show that they were concerned with stopping the organized theft of automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.623" offset="1793860">They were concerned with the transporting of an automobile from one State across a state line to another State and there, turning it over to a fence or a confederate who thereafter concealed, stored or disposed of the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.023" offset="1851434">The heart of the crime, as discussed by the gentleman in Congress, was the transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.618" offset="1877870">But in order to completely get the ring, which they were concerned with, Section 4 was added to take care of the confederate or fence in the other State who disposed of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.496" offset="1925308">We think that therefore that Section 4 was enacted for the purpose of reaching this other party and not for the purpose of pyramiding punishment on the person who violated both sections of the Act with one continuous course of conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="1086.658" offset="4449991">The first case in line, Albrecht against the United States where the defendant was convicted for possession and sale of the same liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.587" offset="4485726">The distinction, as I understand, of the Court in that case was that I may possess liquor and not sell it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.274" offset="4512475">I may sell it and not possess it, therefore, Congress intended to provide punishment for each step.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.348" offset="4540792">Now, there's a direct contrast in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.238" offset="4556361">It's our contention that by the very nature of the Act, it is highly improbable, if not impossible, for the transporter of a stolen vehicle, not only to transport but to receive and also conceal, the very nature of the Act includes all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.542" offset="4633579">Consequently, it is one transaction, which is not the case in Albrecht, as I understand the opinion of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.936" offset="4671091">In United States against Adams, the officer of a federal reserve bank, one in the system, had made two entries to accomplish the fraudulent receipt of $75,000, both entries had reference to the same transaction were of correlated means of accomplishing a single fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.985" offset="4751339">The statute punished any officer of a bank who made any false entry with the intent to defraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.246" offset="4776312">The Court held that the mere multiplication of the entry, all at the same point and with a single intent should not multiply the punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.450" offset="4809122">They had one statute, one amount was obtained by two entries, both aimed at the same purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.386" offset="4832946">In our case, we have one statute, we have one automobile but it was transported, received and concealed in one continuous transaction by one party, Billy Woody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.705" offset="4878190">Blockburger against the United States, as I understand it, held that in determining whether or not one continuous transaction contained separate offenses or whether or not it should be broken down, that the test was whether or not the proof required, the evidence required to sustain a conviction on one count would also, without additional evidence, sustain a conviction on the second count.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.502" offset="5013400">Now, the two of the charges laid against this petitioner, Sections 3 and 4, in our opinion, required exactly the same evidence, no additional evidence required because the act of transportation includes receipt and concealment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.879" offset="5090931">Michener against the United States concerned the (Inaudible) rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.410" offset="5109008">Under the terms of the dissent in that case, I think also that our case, this petitioner's request should be granted because the receipt and concealment of this automobile, which he transported, were but an incident to the transportation which was charged in the first count and the concealment was an integral part of the unlawful transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.226" offset="5228231">United States against C.I.T.Credit Corporation concerned an indictment in 32 counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.789" offset="5250487">The Act provided for $10,000 for violation of any provision and the question presented was whether or not a fine of $320,000 should be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.108" offset="5291760">This Court said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.304" offset="5296567">The offense punishable under the Act was for a course of conduct, that the violation arose from a singleness of thought from a single impulse or conception and that therefore, it is subject to one file.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.799" offset="5350588">Likewise in our case, the petitioner's transportation receipt and concealment of the stolen automobile is one course of conduct, one offense from a single thought, purpose or action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.133" offset="5399907">And as to him, the aggregate of these acts is a single course of conduct and we contend the single offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.502" offset="5433344">Bell against the United States I have discussed in connection with the intention of Congress, it involved the Mann Act, two women transported by one man at the same time in the same car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.185" offset="5488097">The Court held that there was only one offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.435" offset="5505128">Now, neither from the congressional history of this Act or from the Act, itself, can you, in my opinion, come to any conclusion except this was one single transaction, the heart of which was the transportation and as a part of which, which merged with the transportation, the receipt and concealment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1941.051" offset="7867538">It was a changed motor number.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.275" offset="7876524">It also shows that on the 16th of March, this petitioner and another man went back to Sheffield, Alabama, I believe it was, and a bill of sale was executed to this petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.242" offset="7928351">This testimony will also show that on the 1st of April, this petitioner painted this Buick, which was a two-tone black and yellow car, all black.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.585" offset="7981746">He did it out in the road or out in the open by the side of a busy highway with a blanket or some sort of a cover thrown over the fence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2443.045" offset="9875519">And that was position that the Government met in its brief in our position to certiorari.</text>

            <text syncTime="2458.798" offset="9938526">Then this Court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.271" offset="9952423">Now, it's true that technically what was before the Court of -- what was before this Court at the time of the grant of certiorari was the denial of a motion of leave to proceed in forma pauperis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.588" offset="9997772">But with the authority, the power it takes back of this, the Court took it in that posture and decided the merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.198" offset="10028178">Now, it seems to us that the Court took this case for the merits too since the Court of Appeals, although denying leave to proceed in forma pauperis, has passed on the merit on the basis of petitioner's allegation, in effect, sustained the demurrer to his allegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.324" offset="10112711">They said, "Even saying what you -- what you said was true, you haven't made out a case."</text>

            <text syncTime="2593.162" offset="10476022">The -- the Court of Appeal sustained a demurrer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.523" offset="10493471">This Court indicated a desire to hear the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.588" offset="10513742">And that -- at that point, petitioner made a motion on his own, originally before counsel was appointed to him that he wanted the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.421" offset="10561076">Now, as I am going to explain a little later when we get to it, the Government's position has been and consistently been that where the facts are undisputed, the question of multiplicity of punishment for one of them is one which is available on collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.144" offset="10643937">We never denied that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.240" offset="10652296">And therefore, the question is, was this a case where the fact could be conceded and therefore, the merits raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.375" offset="10696913">And so with that in mind we said, "Well can we -- let's get the record and see can we concede the petitioner's allegations are correct."</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.391" offset="10740903">And as it turned out when we got the record, the record, instead of aiding petitioner, was clearly not in his -- not helpful to him, and that was the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.284" offset="10792521">Now, in the Gore case, it's the other way around.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.420" offset="10801089">The same situation to some degree, without denials of leave, happened in Gore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.254" offset="10820420">When the Court took the case on the merit, the petitioner said, "We've made these allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.141" offset="10847901">We'd like to be able to prove them."</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.908" offset="10855006">The record was furnished to him because obviously, on the collateral attack on the judgement, the burden of proof on the allegations will rest on petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.843" offset="10898787">And so our position is that if the record can't be considered, you've got to take the case in the -- in -- pass your most favorable to the Government and therefore, you've got to assume that an indictment which could cover different acts does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.424" offset="10977050">This lot of cases generally, that principle goes through all habeas corpus jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.186" offset="11000142">If we can't get to the record, you've got to take the record in as like most favorable to the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="2782.786" offset="11234513">Now, this, as we understand it, is the situation with respect to record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.648" offset="11265964">This Court decided way back in Ex parte Lang, in Ex parte Schnell, that where on the face of an indictment, it was -- it could be shown from the indictment and the judgment that a sentence was excessive or in violation of double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.097" offset="11387800">That was the matter that could be reached on habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.828" offset="11402637">This was at a time when there was no appeal in criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.569" offset="11417684">And whatever correction came, came by way of habeas corpus in an appeal in that kind of proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.443" offset="11445164">Now, following that precedent, even though (Inaudible) double jeopardy terms, following that precedent, even after there were appeals in criminal cases, the Court considered question of whether a particular sentence was on two counts, that is consecutive sentences, whether that was merely for one offense, that was considered an issue cognizable on habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.448" offset="11597197">And even as suggested by Halladay against Johnson, even cognizable by a motion under Rule 35 to correct an illegal sentence, and that is concededly a very limited motion, which goes only to the face of the indictment and to the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.129" offset="11687894">And so under 35, it's got to be that the indictment and the judgment can't consider anything else.But on habeas corpus, though we've had a somewhat broader scope, and so Morgan against Devine, in 237 United States, you couldn't absolutely tell from the face of the indictment, but the Court says that the attack is not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.255" offset="11788413">And for that reason, they went on to discuss merits, although they held against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.936" offset="11807117">Now, that was a situation in Bell against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.457" offset="11821223">At the time of the brief in our position in Bell, we raised the question of whether that issue was properly cognizable because from the face of the indictment, even though it was on the same day, you couldn't tell whether it was at exactly the same time or at two different times the same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.730" offset="11910248">We didn't press that in the brief in the merits because the authority seem to support the view, that it was proper to -- if there was no dispute as to the facts, to let the -- the issue was one cognizable on habeas corpus and therefore undisputed facts could be shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.567" offset="12017664">Now, there is one case that goes one step beyond that, and it's one of the older ones, it's the Ex parte Nielsen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.747" offset="12042324">This is in 131 United States, and it's discussed at page 18 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.346" offset="12116720">Now, in Nielsen, the indictment charged that the defendant had first pleaded guilty that charged him with unlawful cohabitation until -- for a certain period until May 13th.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.581" offset="12189654">And he pleaded guilty that -- to that indictment in September.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.080" offset="12211702">Subsequently, he was indicted for adultery with the same woman on May 14th, the day after the termination of the first indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.456" offset="12257155">And he made it -- he filed a demurrer to that and said, "Even though the first indictment only went to May 13th at the time I pleaded guilty, the offense extended over until September and covered the second indictment."</text>

            <text syncTime="3075.862" offset="12406784">Now, when -- on the habeas corpus action, the government said, "Oh, no, this is not habeas corpus because this doesn't appear on the face of the indictment."</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.358" offset="12448789">And this Court said that "If the facts of double conviction," and I am quoting, “appears in the indictment or anywhere else in the record, of which the judgment is only a part, it is sufficient, anywhere else in the record.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.577" offset="12521723">In the present case, it appeared on the record in the plea of (Inaudible) which was admitted to be true by the demurrer of the Government, we think this was sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.461" offset="12573236">Now, as we take these cases together, what it amounts to is this, that as long as from a record the fact appear without dispute, that there is no necessity to resolve conflict which would have been resolved by a jury or to go into matters which should have been made at the trial but hadn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.164" offset="12716074">So long as -- what is significant to the issue of multiple offenses appears somehow in the record beyond dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3249.110" offset="13099760">Now, what we were arguing about in Ladner is can he be called -- if he can't prove it by undisputed fact, if he does not have the kind of a record which simply does not present the issues so that we know where it is, can a subsequent 2255 court undertake to try to decide one, whether there was any evidence at the trial on this issue, if there was a conflict, can it try to decide the conflict?</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.571" offset="13269661">And I think maybe because we confined our discussion to that particular problem in Ladner, we gave both impression about what our general position was, as I say at the time of Bell, we didn't dispute the right, although it didn't absolutely appear on the face of the indictment, the problem is this goes right through habeas corpus law generally, that is -- for instance in removal proceeding, the rule was in the old days that removal proceedings' validity of the indictment so on could be considered a removal at the time of removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.877" offset="13422843">But in Rodman against Pothier in 261 United States, the Court says, "But if the issues are going to be complicated, if they are complicated the issues of law are facts, then that's got to go over to the trial court."</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.817" offset="13482611">And the same way in the Bowen case, the Court said, "Well, this is a special kind of jurisdictional issue, and it doesn't turn undisputed facts, and there is no proof that the trial judge went it or not, and so we think the Court can considerate it."</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.388" offset="13564949">But suggestion in the Bowen case is that it's going to involve issues of facts that should have been before the jury then you can't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.875" offset="13590862">So that it maybe unfortunate that relief sometimes depends on whether it's complicated or not, but it's almost necessary realistically because when you got the facts clear and spelled out and no dispute, there's no reason why a court couldn't -- shouldn't consider them.</text>
