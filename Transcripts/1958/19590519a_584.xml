            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 584, Louise Lassiter, Appellant versus Northampton County Board of Elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.583" offset="161729">Mr. Lake, you may proceed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="i_beverly_lake" startTime="16.844" stopTime="389.228">
            <label>Mr. I. Beverly Lake</label>
            <text syncTime="16.844" offset="170715">Mr. Chief Justice, before getting in to our prepared argument, there are two or three other inaccuracies in the argument yesterday by the appellant to which I should like to address the attention of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.166" offset="239992">In response to a question by Mr. Justice Frankfurter, counsel for the appellant made the statement as I recall about the doctrine of Yick Wo against Hopkins has application to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.263" offset="312404">In the opinion of the three-judge federal court to which appellant first went which opinion is set forth and fold in the motion to dismiss and in the brief filed as amicus curiae by the Attorney General of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.640" offset="409893">The three-judge court said this and this hearing was just two months before the application to the Northampton County Board out of which this present appeal arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.421" offset="461093">According from the three-judge court, at the hearing, it was shown without contradiction that the literacy test was applied by the registrar to white persons and negroes alike without discrimination and the cross examination of the three Negro women who were denied registration by the registrar, amply established adequate basis for the denial if their literacy test is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.165" offset="567986">Counsel for the appellant represented her in that case, following that decision, the appellant under their guidance apparently returned to the Northampton County Board and applied again for registration under the 1957 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.704" offset="646144">In this record which consists of stipulated facts, stipulated by counsel for the appellant who represented her in the lower court and before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.345" offset="696717">There is not a shadow of suggestion of any unfair arbitrary discriminatory administration of the statute by this Board or by any other election board in the State of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.271" offset="764426">Now of course in this case, I do not speak for the entire State of North Carolina, I represent the County Board of Northampton County which is the defendant in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.539" offset="813537">But in this record, there is no suggestion of arbitrary administration of the statute anywhere in the State of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.718" offset="858258">Counsel for the appellant in his argument yesterday also stated at least in substance, that the Negroes of North Carolina are given more difficult sections to read, more difficult sections of the North Carolina constitution to read than are the white people.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.561" offset="933595">May I refer to the stipulations which are set forth beginning with the Stipulation Number 9 on page 8 of these records.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.132" offset="979884">There, it is stipulated, Louise Lassiter declined and refused to read the proper sections of the said Constitution or any other section thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.902" offset="1030980">Section -- or Stipulation 15 on page 9 refers to what happened when she appealed to the County Board of Election from the registrar.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.309" offset="1076642">That Louise Lassiter, declined and refused to read the said Board's request -- refused the said Board's request and requirement that she read the profit sections of the Constitution or any other section thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.761" offset="1134425">Stipulation 19 that the said Louise -- excuse me, Stipulation 16, that the said Board of Elections upon Louise Lassiter's failing and refusing to read the proper sections of the said Constitution or any other section thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.708" offset="1206209">Issued a written order and directed that she be denied registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.351" offset="1228779">That order is quoted in the record at page 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.703" offset="1250200">The official order from which this appeal originates states that the Board found as a fact, now skipping down to the middle of the paragraph, it further being found as a fact that the said petitioners refused on June 28, 1957 on the de novo hearing before the Board of Elections to read any section of the State Constitution, she was denied registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.757" offset="1362422">Now then, on page 9 of the record it is stipulated that the said Louise Lassiter because of her lack of educational qualifications on June 22, 1957 and continuously since that said date until the present date is unable to and has failed and refused to write or read or attempt to write or read any section of the Constitution of North Carolina or any Section of the Constitution of the United States and the English language.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.479" offset="1497318">Now, that is the basis for her denial.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.825" offset="1518634">Now, in appendix B of our brief, the brief for the defendant Board, I have quoted in full Article VI of the Constitution of North Carolina obviously the purpose is not to pick out a part of the Constitution which is easy to read, that is the part of the Constitution which if any, has application to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.900" offset="1623019">And I invite the Court's attention the language of that section, Article VI of the North Carolina Constitution.I will not read it because it is too long.</text>

            <text syncTime="418.373" offset="1776828">Now, I don't know sir that these were the sections that she was asked to read, but these are at least part of the sections that she could have read under the invitation to read any other section of the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="588.520" offset="2457475">It was in 1900 under the guidance of Governor Aycock that North Carolina began a tremendous crusade for public education in public schools in North Carolina.</text>

            <text syncTime="635.014" offset="2643466">There is nothing in this record to suggest that any voter, any applicant for registration in North Carolina white or Negro has ever been asked to explain any section of any Constitution of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.728" offset="2698324">The law does not so state and never has so stated in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.164" offset="2720057">And if the counsel for the appellant undertakes to make rebuttal argument, I would like to challenge him to call the attention of the Court to any instance in which that has ever occurred in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.347" offset="2772720">Now, this distinguishes the North Carolina statute from the Alabama statute the so-called Boswell amendment, I believe, which was held unconstitutional in Davis against Schmidt because there the statute did require the applicant to explain provisions of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.079" offset="2855685">And I believe the lower court held that that was an indefinite standard and this Court dismissed the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.411" offset="2889017">Now, I think surely, this Court will not strike down a statute of the State of North Carolina which on its face is a fair test of one's ability to vote intelligently.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.306" offset="2976580">It will not strike down such a statute which the Federal Court of the Eastern District of North Carolina has found to be administered fairly and without discrimination solely on the basis of assertion by counsel outside the record without the slightest bit of evidence to support those assertions.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.826" offset="3066650">Now, the North Carolina statute sets up a procedure for an applicant for registration which I submit meets comfortably every possible requirement of procedural due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.860" offset="3134777">May I review it just a moment?</text>
            <text syncTime="760.203" offset="3144182">The first step is that this is a 1957 statute that I'm talking about now, the statute under which this appellant was denied registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.607" offset="3177827">The first step is that the applicant for registration goes to the registrar of a precinct and there establishes her qualifications to vote including her ability to read and write.</text>

            <text syncTime="879.330" offset="3620655">Now, the history of the North Carolina suffrage law and Mr. Chief Justice I'm coming now to the grandfather clause, because I think that is very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.805" offset="3670601">In 1900 the North -- the Constitution of North Carolina was the one which I shall refer to is a Constitution of 1868.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.673" offset="3710098">That Constitution had no literacy test and it had no grandfather clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.527" offset="3729429">In 1899, the legislatures submitted an amendment to the people of North Carolina which did two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.067" offset="3763597">First, it abrogated the old Article VI, second it substituted a new Article VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.106" offset="3799751">The new Article VI contained the literacy test and contained the grandfather clause of the type later struck down by this Court in Gwin against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.473" offset="3845308">Now, under that -- that of course was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.797" offset="3862549">That act of the legislation which submitted that amendment stated this amendment is submitted as an entire indivisible plan of suffrage and the whole must stand or fall together.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.354" offset="3920750">Now under that, the same legislature -- I believe the next legislature -- that is after the amendment went into the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.312" offset="3960665">The legislature then adopted what we call General Statutes 16328, the predecessor of the statute from which this case arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.308" offset="4000580">That Section 16328 provided a literacy test but it went further than the present statute, it provided that the applicant must establish her ability to read and write to the satisfaction of the registrar.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.488" offset="4061288">It then contained the grandfather clause exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.871" offset="4078843">And again, the legislature, the same legislature adopted a companion statute, 16332, which is relied upon in the brief of my opponents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.649" offset="4129938">That Section, 16332, set up the mechanics for registration under the grandfather clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.148" offset="4159927">That's all that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.206" offset="4168182">Now then, we come on to Clark against Statesville, the Supreme Court of North Carolina there held in 1905 as I stated to the Court yesterday that the grandfather clause did not provide a permanent registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.056" offset="4239548">It provided a list of people eligible for registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.867" offset="4258879">Now, that may sound like the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.720" offset="4266297">I'm coming back to that in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.381" offset="4276851">The Court held in the Clark case, that every time there is a re-registration of voters in North Carolina, everybody must re-register grandfather clause electors and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.018" offset="4335470">Now, there were two supposedly that time, two roads to registration, one was by way of the grandfather clause, one was by way of a literacy test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.896" offset="4378937">The 1957 Act, even if we can assume that the Gwin case did not have that effect because I think it did.</text>

            <text syncTime="1167.391" offset="4772968">I'll pass over the details of the 1945 amendment to the North Carolina Constitution because those details are inconsequential.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.896" offset="4814973">In the North Carolina Court, the opinion from which this case arises shows that the appellant there argue that the 1957 statute violates the North Carolina Constitution for this reason; it is a well established rule in North Carolina of course, that the legislature cannot add to the qualifications for voting which are prescribed to those prescribed by the state constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.628" offset="4941928">That has long been the rule in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.234" offset="4952273">Now, the appellants argued below that the North Carolina Constitution of the amendment of 1902 failed, because of the grandfather clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.155" offset="4995950">The entire amendment, being indivisible, went out the window so we came back to the 1868 Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.425" offset="5025102">Since that Constitution did not have a literacy clause in it, they contend that the 1957 statute was beyond the power of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.042" offset="5067525">It was in an answer to that contention that the North Carolina Court said what it did about the 1945 amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.819" offset="5098663">They say that the 1945 amendment, while admittedly, it did not specifically relate to the grandfather clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.267" offset="5124472">The 1945 amendment undertook to readopt the entire Article VI as it then read in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.898" offset="5167000">Now, I too wish Mr. Justice Frankfurter that the opinion had been stated in somewhat different terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.783" offset="5190510">But the clear effect of the opinion is that the 1945 amendment undertook to readopt the Article VI of the Constitution and freed whether it was already free or not, we won't go in to it, I think it was, said that in 1945 amendment, freed the general assembly to pass the 1957 statute, so the 1957 statute is clearly the law in North Carolina today unless it conflicts with the Constitution of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1678.227" offset="6816266">Number one is this, the counsel for appellee says that the permanent registration situation doesn't exist in North Carolina be just that he said as of 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.109" offset="6867780">Now, we want to point out this that the statutes that set up the permanent registration of the exemptions in 1900 where general statutes 163 Section 32 and Sections that follow Section 32.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.326" offset="6940714">In revising and in rewriting the registration statute in 1957, the journalist seemed only purported to rewrite Section 28 which only dealt with the literacy test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.361" offset="6992854">They did not purport to repeal the Section 32 and the Section that followed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.276" offset="7016469">They did not attempt to rewrite those sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.868" offset="7034859">They left those sections fully intact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.112" offset="7043845">Also, the Court in its opinion below in passing the appellant's case made no allusion whatsoever to the fact or to this any supposition that permanent registration is unconstitutional and can be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.187" offset="7104136">In a prior decision in 1936, all the Court said, all our State Supreme Court said was, that we all not to worry about that because the time for registering under those statutes has left so we have to wait for this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.774" offset="7158471">In the revival that the Court made of the -- of the constitution provision, in the opinion below, what the Court did was to revive the whole business, grandfather clause and all and appellate admits that in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.501" offset="7221373">They revived the entire business except the indivisibility clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.106" offset="7239764">Now, we say that this business of the repeal can be inferred because of other decisions in our court which say that a general -- such as the repeal of Section 28 which dealt with the literacy test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.905" offset="7318967">There was a general repeal there which says that all laws inconsistent would be repealed but now in State -- our court says that that clause does not repeal other sections unless it is just uninterpretable that the two sections could stand and that is not the situation that we have here.</text>
