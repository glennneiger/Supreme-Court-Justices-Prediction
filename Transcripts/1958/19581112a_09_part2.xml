            <text syncTime="1469.897" offset="5982960">When the Court first came to grips, the Ohio Supreme Court with that problem back in General Cigar versus Peck, 159 Ohio State and 152, there was a contention made that the exception of the property of nonresidents from taxation would operate adversely to the resident and the judge of our Court wrote the opinion, Judge Taft said that that was a matter for the General Assembly, not a matter for the Supreme Court of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.034" offset="6147532">That statute has subsequently been construed in two more cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.065" offset="6167594">And that in general, the same -- same result reached that the storage of a nonresident is exempted from taxation, but that the storages of residents are to be included for tax purposes, specifically so held in Youngstown and in the Allied case which followed the Youngstown case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.491" offset="6261321">So, we do had this statute, which was in effect until September 30, 1955 which on one hand except the property of a nonresident and taxes the property of the residents.</text>

            <text syncTime="2194.745" offset="8882343">Up until 1931, Ohio was part -- was known as a general tax state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.670" offset="8910033">At that time, they adopted the classified tax and distinguished between personal property used in business and other personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.124" offset="8947858">In other words, we have no tax upon household goods, jewelry, clothing as I know you understand many states do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.781" offset="8982444">We only tax personal property that is used in business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.053" offset="8999581">And so at that time, they proceeded to set out in a special statute which you have already observed, what's used in business meant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2250.615" offset="9105847">But in 1931, they passed that and there was nothing in there about a nonresident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.164" offset="9132074">It applied generally to every property used in business, all personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.268" offset="9164466">Ohio was an important terminal state, Cincinnati specially, tremendous warehouses, Green, it's the terminal of the Southern Railroad, the terminal of many western railroads, Green Whiskey manufactured good was in Cincinnati.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.774" offset="9246490">Toledo is another terminal, Cleveland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.055" offset="9259551">So these people were being hurt and they asked that the provision be put in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.698" offset="9282121">I think it was authored by Robert A. Taft who was a member of the Senate at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.971" offset="9299257">It was put in to encourage business to come to Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.477" offset="9317230">And that provision as provision as you recall says, "That merchandise or agricultural products belonging to a nonresident of this State is not used in business in this State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.484" offset="9365295">It held a storage warehouse for storage only."</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.593" offset="9377729">And that was for the purposes of attracting business and of course, filling the warehouse that it -- it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.485" offset="9405315">Now, the Tax Commissioner in the Board of Tax Appeals for many years interpreted nonresident as meaning, a person not qualified to do business in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.692" offset="9454111">We have tax laws in Ohio in regard to corporations where you must commend to qualify, make yourself subject to service to the Secretary Of State or statutory agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.037" offset="9499564">This was interpreted as meaning a nonresident as one not qualified to do business in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.974" offset="9531225">And the persons who did business in Ohio of course have to be licensed with our Secretary Of State, recognized as a corporation or an individual doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.315" offset="9580648">This proceeded for a number of years and the Tax Commissioner assessed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.506" offset="9601442">A nonresident meant just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.833" offset="9610742">You've heard here today of the Goodrich case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.889" offset="9626937">In that case which was raised in 1953, the Supreme Court of Ohio first going up to the Tax Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.428" offset="9669047">But the Supreme Court in Ohio was asked to say that nonresident in this statute meant a person who -- well, literally just a nonresident, one who was not incorporated in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.386" offset="9724949">And they held that and they held that Good Year stores -- Goodrich Stores in Ohio that bought merchandise in bulk and shipped it in and stored it before moving it into their stores could do that without paying tax because they were nonresidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.436" offset="9797151">Naturally, this caused quite a bit of confusion in the Ohio tax picture, and this case today results from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.777" offset="9830484">Change in the a law results from that which you referred to the fact 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.458" offset="9853158">There is about a dozen other cases which are pending back in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.598" offset="9869772">In other words, once the lid was off in this Goodrich case, then everyone scrambled to make the most out of an interpretation of a law which have been lying there quietly for 25 years, not molested by the idea that the state address was a particular thing that made them a nonresident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.002" offset="9967365">Well, then these dozen cases came in and the Allied case was one of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.134" offset="9999862">And they said they're doing business as department stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.465" offset="10017207">We're on this corner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.817" offset="10022640">Here is a domestic corporation on this corner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.784" offset="10034552">There is no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.410" offset="10041031">We claim that we are denied equal protection under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.151" offset="10067989">Now, Ohio then changed the law so that -- that it was stricken out and we're discussing now a period from about 1951 until the law was changed in 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.635" offset="10121906">We have a four-year statute, but we also have some open cases by a waiver that go longer than the four-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.106" offset="10151790">In this period of confusion has been the discussion in the center of this number of cases that I'm reading here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.581" offset="10197661">Now, the assumption being that equal protection is denied, they can move directly into the idea that the only way to correct that is for Ohio to say to the residents, the domestics, "You shall receive the same question and you shall receive the same exemption as of nonresident."</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.272" offset="10296508">I might point out further that personal property tax in Ohio is a local situs tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.764" offset="10322422">In other words, it is collected by the county and distributed by the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.439" offset="10341125">It does not come to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.504" offset="10349380">And so, in the several counties of the State where these cases are involved, there is involved a several millions of dollars that has been withheld, determined it -- concerning a determination of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.286" offset="10408521">We had felt that the Ohio Supreme Court decision had settled it, because I differ in the opinion of my good friend General Dargusch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.088" offset="10455751">I do feel that our, Judge Taft, who wrote this opinion did say exactly what you suggested that if there was a discrimination that the Allied Stores were in no position to raise it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.270" offset="10520430">In other words, they could not benefit by raising the issue of discrimination because it meant that they would throw out the exemption granted the nonresidents by application of our statutory rule in Ohio which says that you cannot take apart a certain organic part of a -- of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.296" offset="10628577">And in that attitude, he said this, "Ordinarily a constitutional question will not be considered unless it is necessary to consider such constitutional question in deciding the case before the Court."</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.682" offset="10694092">In our opinion, it is not necessary to consider the constitutional question raised for the taxpayer in the incident case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.038" offset="10719483">Because if its contention with regard to the question is sound, it necessarily leads to the conclusion that the entire proviso in subdivision A of Section 5701.08 which reads so on and so on, would be taxable because it is described by the word -- preceding words remaining in the statute and ending, “stored as merchandise.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.190" offset="10820106">In other words, Judge Taft said, "If I strike this entire section which was put in by amendment two years after the original statute, I would in effect put you out of court because you would have no claim to benefit by them."</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.438" offset="10893145">In other words, the Allied Stores could only bring the tax upon the nonresident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.401" offset="10920939">They could not remove it from themselves.</text>
