            <text syncTime="24.420" offset="201017">If the Court pleases.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.956" offset="211153">We are here on a petition for certiorari, a writ of certiorari to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in a matter arising under the Federal Bank Robbery Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.815" offset="258591">The petition seeks review of a judgment of the Fifth Circuit which in turn had affirmed a decree of the District Court, Northern District of Alabama which refused to vacate or reduce or correct a sentence which as then existed was in three counts before the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.712" offset="358170">There is a little history to this case prior to the action on that motion to the District Court, which was a 2255 motion and, which I mentioned parenthetically, was not opposed on any procedural or jurisdictional ground by the U.S. Attorney who had notice and appealed and argued and was not -- when it eventually reached the Fifth Circuit challenged on any jurisdictional or preliminary or premature argument and was read by the U.S. Attorney in the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.909" offset="499022">Prior to the action of the District Court of which we complain here, there had been, in 1954, a trial on a five-count indictment arising out of a single bank robbery and charging three individuals on five counts with participation in a bank robbery and receipt and disposition and so forth of the stolen funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.715" offset="618245">An appeal was taken from the conviction of guilty on all five counts by the counsel who were -- who was appointed by the District Court to serve the then appellant before the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.581" offset="677700">In the Fifth Circuit, on the direct appeal from the conviction, various arguments were raised by the appellant including the argument that he had been subjected improperly to successive sentencing when that was not allowed by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.685" offset="750111">The Government confessed there apparently in that appeal to the Fifth Circuit, and two counts were found by the Fifth Circuit then to be incorrect and were ordered eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.479" offset="809253">Those were counts which charged the defendant with both being guilty under the provision of the statute making robbery a crime and the provision making larceny a crime, so that on remand, from the Fifth Circuit then, the District Court was ordered to eliminate two counts and we were left with three counts.</text>

            <text syncTime="210.204" offset="944149">And as will later appear, the -- the Fifth Circuit enacting in the -- in the decree, which I now challenge, in part rested its present decision on the fact that this was a repetition of the argument which had been made in the first direct appeal to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.945" offset="1027114">So that when we got back to the -- when they got back to the District Court, I have not yet in the case, the sentence was reduced from 20 years and two days to 10 -- to 14 years and one day which results from the three counts based on robbery, aggravated robbery, that is robbery in which an assault upon an individual was committed, conspiracy and the count, which I now challenge here, the count based on subsection (c) for receiving and possessing and disposing of the funds which were taken in the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.896" offset="1178937">On that count, we were given a year and a day, basically, therefore, the issue we --</text>

            <text syncTime="305.543" offset="1325537">I -- I would say though in regard to that there's very little evidence in this matter of what disposition if any was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.530" offset="1361481">And I am -- although I am getting little ahead of it, I -- I'm prepared to say that in this case, it seems to me that the Court can do one of two things, it can decide and dispose of the question of the validity of Count 4, the one that I am now challenging because the indictment itself in the record, the -- the true record that's before this Court shows that they were considering -- both courts below were considering a single robbery, a single transaction or single impulse, however you wish to put it.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.252" offset="1512364">And if, as I was surprised to find, that it is possible to bring before this Court now, as the Government is doing, a transcript of the evidence taken in the first trial at this late hour, I would technically think that's wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.406" offset="1584985">The Circuit Court of Appeals did not consider it.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.428" offset="1601076">I think that that is -- that creates a situation in which a petitioner likely might be prejudiced, but I don't feel that we are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.306" offset="1640573">I don't think the facts are much in dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="398.958" offset="1699192">And when I use the term “transcript of the evidence” I am talking about the testimony that was taken in the trial as distinguished from what I considered to be the -- the true record that's before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.086" offset="1747675">There is a printed record here.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.414" offset="1761050">That transcript of evidence will show that our position, I think, is unassailable.</text>

            <text syncTime="438.203" offset="1856136">But later, I thought that I ought to know what had taken place in the trial, and I said about trying to get hold of the transcript of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.904" offset="1891035">None was available.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.040" offset="1895528">Apparently, the Government had lost it, so I didn't get one.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.854" offset="1910784">The only one that we could find was the one that's filed in the Clerk's Office of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.271" offset="1932413">And the Court was kind enough to let me withdraw that so that I might read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.473" offset="1953311">And then the Government -- the Attorney General's Office got after us to let them use the copy that we had withdrawn, which we were glad to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.035" offset="1983509">And now, they want to file that with the Court over my objection, but I am really not objecting because I don't think the facts are here us at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="638.243" offset="2656319">You are in a position to say here that you've got a -- a typical bank robbery that has then, for purposes of Congress, dealt with in stages but for purposes of punishment, does not warrant imposition of -- of successive sentences where all the man does is rob the bank and take the money at the time and put it in his pocket so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.498" offset="2757360">Now, we think that our argument is supported a little bit better in this instance by the history of the Act and by what the Act itself says.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.453" offset="2813158">The Government belittles the fact that the 1948 codification eliminated from the provision of the statute that deals with receipt and disposition and so forth, a provision for $5000 fine and so forth and instead, merely says in effect that a man who receives the stolen money should be punished in the same manner as the taker.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.249" offset="2924335">In common ordinary English, that dealing with one, the receiver and two, the taker.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.453" offset="2953174">It -- you can't mean anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.950" offset="2963205">The Government has found some difficulty itself in deciding what this Act provides with respect to successive sentencing because they went into the Fifth Circuit, as I understand, in the Heflin -- in the case, the Heflin case on the first appeal and confessed error, said, “You're right, you can't convict a man for robbery and larceny at the same time.”</text>
            <text syncTime="738.271" offset="3056410">And then according to one of the footnotes as I recall in the position of this Court in the Prince case, they said we were wrong in doing that, we still think now that you can sentence him for everything, for entering, for robbery, for larceny and aggravated larceny -- robbery and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.607" offset="3125791">So that the Government finds itself unable, at all times, to be sure just what this Act provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.428" offset="3157034">And I think probably a little more, definitely than -- it occurs in most of the legislative history that was considered in Prince.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.289" offset="3204577">Our legislative history shows what Congress had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.317" offset="3220668">The Senate Report, for instance, and we've set it out on page 9, we refer to it, of our brief, it says, captions, “Senate Report Number 1801” which was the report from the Senate leading to the 1940 amendment which added the crime that we are concerned with in the receiving count.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.288" offset="3316485">That Senate Report was captioned “Punishment for Receivers of Loot From Bank Robbers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="811.648" offset="3349922">And I think a common sense reading of that obviously means that they were dealing with the receiver distinctly from the man who is the robber and that basically is our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.706" offset="3398196">Now, certainly, in view of the doubts which the Government has had in view of the -- at best, ambiguity in the statute, the doctrine of lenity has some -- has some real application here.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.211" offset="3460263">The Court has been considering that problem and has heard argument about it for two days, and I'm not going to go back over those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.047" offset="3499551">However, I -- I think that if ever there was a -- a perfect case for the application of that doctrine of construction, this is it, which leads me finally in -- to consideration of the Prince case itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.742" offset="3566320">We've said frankly to the Court in our brief, we think the Prince case decides this.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.852" offset="3586800">We think it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.668" offset="3594010">We think that as near as possible, the Prince case has said, “You've got a statute here that deals with bank robbery.”</text>
            <text syncTime="883.004" offset="3635388">It -- it deals with all phases of bank robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.909" offset="3650957">However, although Congress has seen fit to deal with a bank robbery as a crime which can have various phases before, during and after, those phases are not, when committed by one who completes a bank robbery, each entitled to be made the basis of a separate count and a separate sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.217" offset="3756283">In Prince, of course, the man committed the first phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.333" offset="3768717">He entered the bank and then the robbery occurred, and he was found -- and this decision -- the Court -- the decision of this Court in Prince holds that he couldn't be sentenced twice for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.895" offset="3818977">Well, what we are looking at here is what happened after he robbed the bank and he left and put the money in his pocket so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.218" offset="3848234">If there is any distinction between Prince and my case, it's chronological and nothing else because in -- in the amendment that we are dealing with, the 1940 amendment, Congress reached out to be sure that it brought within the net people who deal with bank loot after the robbery has been completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.986" offset="3927333">In the 1937 amendment, as I recall, that was before the Court, Prince, Congress was dealing with -- with people who were intended felons but for some reason, did not complete their bank robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.085" offset="3983757">And I submit that it's perfectly reasonable to assume that a man in Prince, for instance, might enter a bank and remain there several hours and decide not to complete the robbery or the -- his confederates fail to appear or the -- the strategy doesn't work out, and he'd be guilty if proven to have had this plan underway.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.798" offset="4082604">And he may spend -- he may very well spend considerably more time than was spent after the bank robbery by my -- by this petitioner who, as the record will show if the Court does look at this transcript, immediately after the robbery which occurred in the West End branch of the First National Bank of Birmingham in West End, they drove using two cars, drove several blocks to their apartment and they proceeded immediately within a matter of an hour or two to divide up the loot according to the testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="2359.367" offset="9540838">Lest, however, as we say, petitioner be mislead into thinking that an otherwise meritorious contention which first was turned down in 1955 is again rejected solely because of some procedural defect -- defect which he has been noted, he can start all over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.551" offset="9629550">We submit that petitioner's great reliance upon the Prince decision, the facts or the legislative history therein is in this context misplaced and this bring us to the second issue, whether one, who has successfully consummated a bank robbery of a bank which either is insured by the United States or is a national bank, can then proceed to conceal for future use or dispose of the fruits of this crime to the detriment, obviously, of the United States without any fear of prosecution or punishment for such further separate activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.611" offset="9845844">And this -- there are two very clear points to be made, we feel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2465.098" offset="9963813">And I suggest to this Court, and this is not what Congress did in the statute, he used all inclusive language and they did not write in the exception that this property must be first stolen by any other person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.712" offset="10038209">Now, I go further in this case or we can always imagine and figure out words to be placed in statute to create a favorable situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.630" offset="10101844">In this particular instance, however, Congress did have a prototype.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.179" offset="10128071">Now, this, unfortunately, is not in our brief but we feel that because of what has been discussed in regard to what language could go into statutes, it is very necessary that we call this to the Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.959" offset="10199228">In 1940 when this statute was passed, there was on the books, Title 18 United States Code, 1946 edition, 101 also 35 Statute 1098.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.681" offset="10298075">Now, I emphasize the 1946 Code because it has been subsequently changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.318" offset="10320645">But in other words, this statute that I have now cited was on the books in 1940 when subsection (c) was added to the bank robbery statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.081" offset="10371741">Now, this section held in connection with the theft of government property in regard to the receiver and it had this wording, “Whoever shall receive, conceal and so forth,” the typical wording, “with intent to convert to his own use and so forth, any money property and so forth of the United States which has heretofore been embezzled, stolen or purloined by any other person, by any other person,” I emphasize, “knowing the same have been embezzled and so forth shall be punished.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.315" offset="10548642">In other words, what we are saying to this Court is what petitioner is asking this Court to do is to write into subsection (c) of the bank robbery statute, whoever does these things with money which has been stolen by some other person shall be punished and so forth, but we suggest not only is that not what was done by Congress but we further suggest that if that was what they wanted to do, if that's what they wanted to do, they have the prototype at the time in the context of not just transporting, which gets to another jurisdictional constitutional problem, but in the context of theft which is what we have in the bank robbery statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2833.104" offset="11435760">This statute -- first I give the United States Code, it's 1946 edition, 18 United States Code 101, 35 Statutes 1098.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.685" offset="11510157">This, by the way, is now 18 United States Code 641.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.756" offset="11526353">It does not contain that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.609" offset="11545788">I move on to the legislative history because I think this also is not as simple as petitioner would have this Court believe and does not lead us into the same type of problem that Prince led us into.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.530" offset="11613497">The legislative history of this subsection is brief but it is very much to the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.958" offset="11643173">It is based almost entirely, almost entirely upon a letter which was sent by the then Attorney General to both the House of Representatives and the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.223" offset="11696253">There was no debate on the floor of the House or the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.060" offset="11715584">There were no amendments made to the proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.261" offset="11732407">I can find no discussion of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.045" offset="11747558">We are therefore left with solely this letter, which, by the way, composes almost the whole of the Report of the Senate and composes almost the whole of the Report of the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.897" offset="11810983">In this letter, which we have set out for the greater part on page 15 and 16 of our brief, the Court will note that one thing -- that certain things are made very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.144" offset="11891963">First of all, the letter clearly called for a separate substantive offense In specific language, it called for that and I assume that's what it meant, number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.397" offset="11960926">Number two, unlike Prince, this was not a problem that arose because somebody got into a bank that they weren't able to convict him of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.247" offset="12004394">This clearly came from two other statutes, the wording of -- of the bank robbery receiving statute, in other words, clearly came from the National Stolen Property Act and the ransom provision in the Federal Kidnapping Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.690" offset="12106167">I say “clearly came” because the present statute contains seven verbs and the only way you can get them is to put these two together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.361" offset="12148799">But the legislative history clearly says that's where they got this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.335" offset="12172727">I should also mention at this time then in order to relate it to the previous case that there is also no question that the National Stolen Property Act wording came directly from the Dyer Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.498" offset="12237406">So what we have, what we have in this section are a series of words which, I assume, have some meaning then in relation to theft of cars, transportation of cars, interstate transportation of other property and securities in relation to the disposition of ransom money and although it's not mentioned here, it's quite clear that the same provision is also involved in receiving stolen cattle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.680" offset="12398111">And there are numerous others federal statutes, in other words, that have exactly the same meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.771" offset="12426428">Now, this becomes important in this sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.840" offset="12442728">This statute, subsection (c) was passed in 1904.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.225" offset="12472299">The bank robbery provisions which this Court considered in Prince were substantially completed by 1937 with almost all their amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.482" offset="12521305">This came in, in other word, at a separate time and at a time when these same words, these same words in the context of some of these other acts had -- we believe already had a uniform consistent interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.439" offset="12613151">In other words, by 1940, for example, there was no question, at least it had not been raised as a question which had been cited adverse to the Government that the transporter as well as the receiver could be the same person under the Dyer Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.086" offset="12699669">As such, we suggest then, if these are the same words, and it's such a much later date and written and suggested coming from Attorney General who we suggest most probably knew of these other cases, then if we read anything from this, as to intent of the legislation, we suggest it should be read that they intended, that they intended then that both sections could apply to the same one and the same person.</text>

            <text syncTime="5344.864" offset="21482872">In conclusion, I would say that in all of the three questions which we have submitted, one, jurisdiction, two, the meaning of subsection 3 and (c) on the double jeopardy.</text>
