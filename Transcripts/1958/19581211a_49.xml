            <label>Mr. David Previant</label>
            <text syncTime="7.155" offset="131950">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.656" offset="134040">I think that I have some five minutes left of my time.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.998" offset="155355">I was so advised and I should like to devote that very brief time to making more definitive answer to a question which was put by Mr. Justice Whittaker at the beginning of the argument yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.401" offset="212929">The question as I recall it was whether or not there was any significance to the fact or should be attached to the fact that these leases or contracts of transportation or at least the one which appears in the record was executed prior to the execution of the 1955 contract which was the subject of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.431" offset="285132">I feel that the findings of the Ohio Courts and the judgment of the Ohio Courts make it clear that this case was not litigated on the idea of any malicious interference with an existing contract right, but that it was litigated on the idea that this contract was per se in violation of the particular statute of the State of Ohio which is here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.342" offset="388786">At Page 256 of the record, it appears the findings of fact in the judgment of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.850" offset="418774">And I would call to this Court's attention, finding 2 (d) that Article 32 squarely is in conflict with the public policy of the State of Ohio as reflected on Section 1331.01 Revised Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.128" offset="483871">And it is void and unenforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.095" offset="495783">The Court goes on in its judgment and it's the first paragraph of its judgment to say that the defendants are hereby perpetually restrained and enjoined from entering into any agreements one with the other or carrying out the effects, requirements or terms of any such agreement which will require the alteration, cancellation, or violation of plaintiff-appellee's existing lease or leasing agreement or any such agreement hereafter renewed or renegotiated and entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.225" offset="656280">The Court then goes on in subsequent paragraphs to restrain these defendants from any such contracts in the future and perpetually enjoins and restrains us from it anytime enforcing Section 30 -- Article 32 of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.123" offset="735901">I think throughout the litigation, the opinions of the Court, the findings of the courts below, the judgment of the courts below, the question presented was whether or not, this article of this contract was per se void not whether or not it happened to interfere with any particular existing lease arrangement of Revel Oliver or anybody else is.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.067" offset="831613">I might say in that regard that if that were all that were involved in this case, that matter could have and probably would have been settled in the collective bargaining table.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.566" offset="877589">And I would assume that we do not have any right to enter into a contract at this time which would completely destroy existing contracts which a carrier may have with someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.200" offset="928162">That's a matter for bargaining and I supposed it's a matter for exclusion of existing contracts during the course of bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.577" offset="949687">But that isn't this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.375" offset="956897">This is not the case of where the plaintiff comes in and asked only that we refrained from maliciously interfering with an existing agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.485" offset="993364">He comes in and says that our collective bargaining contract is completely void contrary to the public policy of the State of Ohio as expressed in the Antitrust Act of the State of Ohio and therefore we are perpetually restrained from enforcing that contract as to him and as to anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.810" offset="1058565">Not only as to existing contracts but as to contracts he made, enter into with carriers in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.310" offset="1084583">So we believe that that particular point was not an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.604" offset="1101824">I would further point out as I indicated yesterday that the 1952 contract containing the identical provision, Article 32 was restrained upon its execution and while it was under the cover of that restraint, that the 1953 lease was entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.915" offset="1183013">And then that restraint was again imposed upon the 1955 contract subsequently litigated all the way through to completion.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.183" offset="1216136">So, as I said yesterday, if these restraints have not been imposed, the carrier as he testified would have been in compliance with the contract and many of the issues which were adjudicated in Ohio under -- under those facts would not have been subject to adjudication in our opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="342.519" offset="1473494">It can be submitted in the posture of whether or not when we ask for this kind of an agreement whether we are bargaining collectively and in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.810" offset="1502647">In other words, is this within the area of either compulsory or permissive bargaining which this Court refer to in the Borg-Warner case.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.337" offset="1532740">Now if we are insisting that an employer signed this agreement with this article in it and if the Labor Board is satisfied that it so unrelated to wages, hours, and working conditions, it could find us guilty, so to speak, of an unfair labor practice under the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.092" offset="1603688">And do an order restraining us from seeking to negotiate this particular article.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.710" offset="1626258">That is one way in which it could have been presented to the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.036" offset="1639528">It could have been presented to the board by Mr. Oliver in one or two postures.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.848" offset="1662725">He might have gone to the board and said that we were committing an unfair labor practice because we were insisting that he, as an independent contractor, become a member of our labor union.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.091" offset="1703685">That is a specific unfair labor practice under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.036" offset="1715493">Labor union has no right to force an independent contractor to become a member of a labor union.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.603" offset="1737749">He could have complained about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.445" offset="1745168">He might have filed a petition for representation claiming that he and his employees or rather that his employees were a separate unit for the purposes of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.049" offset="1787591">And the board in that proceeding could have determined whether or not he was an employer, whether or not his employees -- were employees of his and whether or not, we could make them employees of someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.655" offset="1842030">As a matter of fact, there's a proceeding now pending in the Court of Appeals, growing out of these very same circumstances although the parties are not identical, in which as a result of this restraining order, the union did make a request upon the so-called fleet owners to bargain with the union pending the resolution of this problem in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.286" offset="1928547">And when the fleet owners refused to bargain with the Union, the Union struck the fleet owners and picketed at the premises of A.C.E.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.669" offset="1966059">Now the board, contrary to the finding of what I should I say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.575" offset="1977657">The trial examiner found that A.C.E. and the fleet owners were co-employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.450" offset="1997197">And therefore, this was not a secondary boycott situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.935" offset="2011094">The Board reversed that finding of the trial examiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.847" offset="2022797">The Board found that the fleet owner was the sole employer and therefore when we picketed at the A.C.E. premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.524" offset="2057488">We were engaging in a secondary boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.701" offset="2066160">We have taken that matter on appeal, but I would like to emphasize two things, number one, this is a fine example of how productive of strike the interference of the state court and the state agencies has been in this case because were it not for the restraining order entered in this case which is now before this Court saying that we could not enforce the provisions of this contract, there would have been no question but that these people would have been employees of A.C.E. and that we would have been in the legitimate labor dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="529.739" offset="2222373">May it please this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.981" offset="2255287">I will devote the time allotted Your Honors to the position of Revel Oliver, the owner operator and plaintiff below in the trial courts of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.373" offset="2324877">And Mr. Iden will devote his time to the position of the carriers, Interstate and A.C.E. and we will try to keep our arguments and positions as to those respective parties are separate as we can.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.159" offset="2424038">Throughout the briefs of the Teamsters Union and their position in this Court, they have studiously and methodically ignored the keystone of foundation contract on which this litigation began.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.255" offset="2528423">Justice Whittaker has saved me some time in ascertaining that the contracts on which the plaintiff relied in the trial courts and the contract which was given interpretation on the question of relationship and status was the contract existing and in full force and effect for more than three years prior to the execution of the collective bargaining contract known as the “Over the Road Agreement” attached as an exhibit to this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.821" offset="2730611">This contract between Revel Oliver and the carriers with A.C.E. was dated December 28th 1953 as appears on Pages 145 and 149 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.035" offset="2819532">For a period of many years before that, identical contracts were in existence varying only in description and license number of the tractor and trailer leased.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.862" offset="2878777">Oliver's lease dated June the 20, 1955 for the Mac Truck in Ohio Body Trailer with Interstate, was a replacement of equipment that he had leased at this company's business since 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.581" offset="2957667">And so we reached the conclusion that the contracts between Oliver and the carriers where all existing prior to the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.938" offset="3011166">Now the A.C.E. contract with Oliver provides among other things on Page 147 of the record the relationship created is that of independent contractor and not that of employer and employee, the operator is a contractor only and not the employee of the carrier and that is the quote from that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.163" offset="3136031">Secondly, the Interstate calls Oliver the leasor and provides an addition to the lease of the equipment that Oliver and I quote, “Will also furnish one or more competent drivers as maybe the case,” from page 150 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.764" offset="3214399">We conclude that the independent contractor relationship was established by the wording of these contracts themselves existing at the time that the collective bargaining arrangement was entered in to between the carriers and the union.</text>

            <text syncTime="2297.142" offset="9291943">And this very Court in the MC-43 case held that it's perfectly proper for a carrier to operate on the basis of owning his own equipment or leasing equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.118" offset="9359862">And there, the majority of this Court found that the regulation of the ICC with reference to trip leases was the perfectly validly regulation which the Commission was authorized to make and which this Court would approve.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.059" offset="9427571">Two of the members of this Court took the position that even that interfered with the legal right of the carrier to choose, whether or not he should use leased or company-owned equipment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2633.927" offset="10639130">The Board still would have been looking at the narrow issue of A.C.E. in the one case, Interstate in the other case versus the board and the employees and it still would not have had at any jurisdiction under the antitrust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.160" offset="10695973">The question wouldn't even been presented to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.620" offset="10709870">Now, I wanted to discuss just a little bit the ICC Section, the question in which it was raised in brief and wasn't argued here and I'm only saying that now because a decision of this Court germane to that subject, I believe will answer the question we're on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.380" offset="10776848">In the southern rate case, the State of Georgia versus The Pennsylvania Railroad, that's not cited in my brief, 324 U.S.439.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.029" offset="10815509">In that case, the State of Georgia was accusing the northern railroads of preferring northern industry and northern states above the interest of the southern States particularly State of Georgia and their industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.254" offset="10880397">And so they made a request to file an original action in this case, in this Court under the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.144" offset="10903907">And this case was a discussion of that -- of the right of the State of Georgia to bring that action in this Court under that constitutional provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.135" offset="10947897">There was no question in this -- in the decision to what the ICC was the only body that could remove the rates or could control the rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.708" offset="10982170">This Court had no authority on that subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.638" offset="10997948">But the Court recognized this and said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.541" offset="11009546">That these subordinate congressional boards do not have antitrust jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.545" offset="11045595">And so while the ICC would look at an isolated rate by a particular railroad and would say the rate was good or bad, the ICC would not look at the whole picture to see -- say whether or not, there was a conspiracy which affected the filing of these rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.397" offset="11120933">So that this Court said that this Court sitting here is the only Court that can look at the whole picture to inquire as to whether or not there is a conspiracy behind these moving the railroads in filing their rates tothe Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.822" offset="11194702">And so this Court said this, “This action will free the rate making function of the influences of a conspiracy over which the Commission, the Interstate Commerce Commission has no authority, but which he had proven to exist can only hinder the Commission in the tasks with which it is confronted.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.470" offset="11277249">And the Court said, further if -- this Court, it will eliminate from ratemaking the collusive, the practices which the antitrust laws condemn and which are not sanctioned by the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.066" offset="11331688">So I say here, assuming that the board had said that this was a proper subject to bargain and assuming the board said, “Sign the contract,” in the case it would been negotiated when we refused to sign it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.666" offset="11394069">Still, the National Labor Relations Board would not have the jurisdiction to inquire into the broad subject to determine that this identical clause affecting the lease of equipment was being enforced and put as against every carrier in the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.302" offset="11476616">That's the jurisdiction of Board wouldn't have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.346" offset="11488737">So that under your decision in the southern rate making case, the antitrust laws are still enforceable by the Court because we can't make the assumption that Oliver is not an independent contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.784" offset="11550490">That fact has been found by the trial court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2921.549" offset="11789563">And in their zeal, instead of -- they say we should -- that Oliver and the owner-operators should have petitioned for an election.</text>

            <text syncTime="2931.725" offset="11830314">They chose to strike the owner-operators and A.C.E and they also chose to strike A.C.E.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.988" offset="11855287">And so the owner-operators, a large group of them and big companies filed charges for the secondary boycott with the board.</text>
