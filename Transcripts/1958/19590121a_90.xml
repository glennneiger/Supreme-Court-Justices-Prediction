            <text syncTime="36.764" offset="250441">Mr. Chief Justice, Honorable Associate Justices, if it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.404" offset="276982">This is a criminal case which has been in the federal courts throughout its entire life.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.556" offset="313553">In November 1949, Johnny Ray Smith was apprehended under the Osceola Hotel in Geneva, Alabama by the FBI.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.600" offset="365798">He and two others, who later became his codefendants, were carried to Dothan where they were arraigned and incarcerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.481" offset="413341">They -- this was on a Friday.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.533" offset="425462">They were questioned that night in Saturday and Sunday, and right in the early Monday morning, the 21st day of November, 1949, they were carried to Montgomery.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.412" offset="488991">There, they had a conference with the Assistant United States Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.989" offset="515323">And during that time or some time during the morning while they were in the United States Attorney's Office, FBI agent John Lill went to the chambers of Judge Charles Kennamer, presiding judge, and had a conference with him about this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.273" offset="604453">Shortly thereafter, Judge Kennamer went on the bench, Johnny Ray Smith and his two defendants -- codefendants, who were two 17-year-old boys, Johnny Ray was 26, went into the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.683" offset="670072">And in the words of the Fifth Circuit after a few didactic questions, all three defendants pled guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.178" offset="708106">Whereupon, the judge says, “I have discussed this matter with Mr. Lill,” meaning the FBI agent and immediately proceeded to pronounce sentences, 30 years to Johnny Ray and 15 years to each of the two 17-year-old boys.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.029" offset="783444">Now, Smith was incarcerated in the federal prison system and finally was sent to California to Alcatraz.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.291" offset="824508">He there initiated a petition, a -- a petition for writ of habeas corpus, and it got to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals there.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.993" offset="875395">They told him he had the wrong remedy, that he should be proceeding under 2255.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.834" offset="902666">Thereupon, he filed in the Fifth Circuit in Alabama after making due motions to Judge Kennamer.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.226" offset="932237">The Fifth Circuit of Alabama of the Fifth -- not of Alabama but the United States Court of Appeals Circuit, granted him this relief under 2255 and ordered a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.120" offset="987826">At that stage, I was fortunate enough to be appointed by the Court to come in to defend the man's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.436" offset="1025128">We had a full hearing with the petitioner being brought from Alcatraz and then the presiding District Judge decided we were entitled to no relief so we went to the -- back to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.417" offset="1097017">And in 238 F. 2d 925, they issued another opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.027" offset="1131499">We thought we had won our lawsuit at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.779" offset="1146441">They decided that when it comes to the controlling question whether or not the waivers and the plea was taken in violation of due process, that it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.961" offset="1195238">And in the opinion they set out a number of reasons why they thought it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.836" offset="1214673">Then the judgment is reversed, the cause is remanded with directions to grant the motion to set aside the conviction and sentence and to proceed further and not inconsistently, herewith.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.129" offset="1275904">The United States Attorney saw fit to file for rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.983" offset="1295339">The rehearing was refused but the Court added a further sentence in addition to what I just read, including if the District Judge is of the opinion that the ends of justice required it, permitting the defendant to withdraw his waiver of counsel and his plea of guilty, and to stand trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.693" offset="1394186">We went back to the Fifth Circuit Court again -- to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals again, and pointed out that we thought it was quite inconsistent in the body of the opinion to say, the due -- due process has not been granted because of the waivers and these other matters which I'm going to bring up that we thought we were entitled to more relief but we didn't get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.536" offset="1517484">Hence, we are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.400" offset="1525008">Now, what our District did -- Judge did, when the case was sent back to him with these instructions, was the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.461" offset="1565236">When the case was called we appeared and he did remove -- he followed the Court in removing the conviction and the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.495" offset="1609331">As the man stood before the Court, with the conviction and sentence removed, we asked for a writ of habeas corpus, which was refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.259" offset="1652381">We then asked to withdraw our plea of guilty, which was refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.225" offset="1680280">Then we asked to withdraw the waivers of indictment of counsel and venue which was refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.934" offset="1715075">Then as he stood before the Court, based on this plea he had made in 1949, the Court sentenced him to 10 additional years.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.561" offset="1753631">The man had been in jail eight years at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="427.386" offset="1812877">When it came back to him, he reduced the sentence on the fact we had a 30-year sentence to start with.</text>

            <text syncTime="5264.246" offset="21160312">The first thing before we got that notice, we'd have to have a waiver of indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5269.515" offset="21181419">And when the indictment was waived, that doesn't mean that we know what the United States Attorney is going through.</text>
            <text syncTime="5276.224" offset="21208273">I think Judge Rives does it very nicely here with Rule 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="5281.910" offset="21231052">While Rule 7 vests a wide discretion in the United States Attorney and frees him from the necessity of obtaining leave of the court in case it's properly prosecuted by information, its language leaves no doubt that such uncontrolled discretion does not include the right to preclude the imposition of the death penalty in any case which might possibly be so punished.</text>
            <text syncTime="5308.100" offset="21335751">A discretion which could therefore be finally exercised by no one man alone, in other words, the whole proposition there is jurisdiction above all other matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="5318.481" offset="21377337">Most exist from the beginning and should affirmatively appear of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5324.912" offset="21403042">And I might further add that if that jurisdiction did not exist, then the case falls on its face and an answer to what you Justice Black the point your raise as to what could be the possible consequences of this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5342.282" offset="21472528">I think we would first ask this Honorable Court to determine that there was no jurisdiction about which this information could be brought or no -- no way why that -- by which this information could be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="5355.452" offset="21525191">Therefore there was no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5357.845" offset="21534804">We think that I will not go back into the Parrino case in any detail because I'm sure the Court will make a determination and that case would either stand or fall on one of our interpretations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5369.579" offset="21581720">We think the statute of limitations that -- that the Honorable Chief Justice, the question he raised there they have to discuss by Judge Hand in that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5378.988" offset="21619336">Therefore we would ask this Honorable Court that it'd be determined that the United States Attorney have no way and since this is a capital case, since a man could be punished by death, to commence his action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5395.924" offset="21687045">If he had no way to commence the action, there was no jurisdiction within the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5401.129" offset="21707839">Secondly, we would -- in the event that we did not prevail in that position, we would like to urge that the lower court was quite right in determining that this man had not properly waived his right to counsel, venue and jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5423.340" offset="21796760">And that therefore these other two things which followed in consequence his plea, I think you -- we can put them all in one package and follow 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -- 10 pins practically.</text>
            <text syncTime="5434.248" offset="21840332">Then that plea as well as the conviction must be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="5438.423" offset="21857050">And that that is defining and is the law as announced by the Fifth Circuit at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5445.361" offset="21884844">Therefore if we do not prevail (Inaudible) to jurisdiction, we would think that the lower court could not -- it had a situation that was impossible to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="5457.472" offset="21933223">The Court of Appeals said, “These things were taken in violation of due process.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5462.941" offset="21955166">Then they said -- set aside the sentence and proceed not inconsistent therewith.</text>
            <text syncTime="5468.618" offset="21977840">Well, it is certainly inconsistent to find that a man has been deprived of due process by certain things he's done, namely, these waivers and not to follow through and say that all the waivers and the plea and the convictions should all be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="5483.969" offset="22039280">That would be our second request.</text>
            <text syncTime="5485.691" offset="22046177">If the Court got that far that all the pleas and the waivers be set aside for a violation of due process and, of course, this Court has made many other which is on due process --</text>
