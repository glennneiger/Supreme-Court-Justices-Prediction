            <text syncTime="33.639" offset="134478">And the obvious trouble that I get into one, this question is that soliciting votes or voting for -- for communist candidates, its obviously a protected right, constitutionally protected right.</text>

            <text syncTime="126.877" offset="507507">I'm not suggesting that you have to prove illegal acts but they are affirmative acts which a man takes in order to -- as part of his membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.395" offset="541571">And when you tie those in with knowledge as to the aims of the party and his intent that these aims shall be brought to provision then it seems to me that we try the man in with a -- with an -- with an offense which can be punished under the constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1364.600" offset="5458338">Mr. Davis mentioned Section 17 of the Internal Security Act which says that the foregoing provision shall be construed as being in addition to and not a modification of existing criminal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.362" offset="5517375">I don't believe that that provision cuts one way or the other on our point of disagreement here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.542" offset="5542139">That is a general provision which I believe was on the statutory draft long before 4 (f) came in and started to get modified.</text>

            <text syncTime="1405.029" offset="5620088">It seems to me that the argument is not advanced one way or another by reference to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.138" offset="5648509">The other thing on 4 (f) that Mr. Davis spoke of that I do want to say something about, is his argument relating to 4 (a) and 4 (c) of the Internal Security Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.309" offset="5697202">If I understood him right, he is suggesting that if my point of view is correct that a communist can't be prosecuted as such under the membership clause that the same thing would apply under 4 (a) and 4 (c).</text>

            <text syncTime="1442.756" offset="5770971">We are not suggesting that communists and so communism would be read out of either the Smith Act or the Internal Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.638" offset="5810469">What we have in 4 (f) is two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.335" offset="5817260">You would have an evidentiary bar in the 2nd Section which is the second sentence which as Justice Frankfurter pointed out is under the Counselman rule, plainly insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.268" offset="5861042">And because of that, you would then have the interpolation of the first sentence which is not an evidentiary bar but is an immunity from prosecution provision and the question is what is it breadth?</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.213" offset="5908793">That -- that is the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.756" offset="5918929">Now, under 4 (a) of the Internal Security Act, the crime is knowingly to combine, conspire or agree with any other person to perform an act which would substantially contribute the establishment of a total -- totalitarian dictatorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.804" offset="5979115">Would an indictment be valid which charged that the so and so combined, conspired and agreed to perform an act in that he became a member of the communist party?</text>

            <text syncTime="1604.685" offset="6418704">But I look at the Government's brief and I see at the top of page 25 that the -- if all that were involved were bear membership plus some attendance in party meetings, there would be more foundation to the argument if the De Jonge case applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.540" offset="6474083">This argument disappears when the requirement of activity is added and I construed that previously to mean that attendance at party meetings wouldn't be enough.</text>

            <text syncTime="1705.371" offset="6821407">This talk about activities seems to me to utterly overlook the facts that the membership clause itself covers affiliates as well as members or becomes or is a member of or affiliates with any such society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.180" offset="6868637">Now, in the (Inaudible) case in the Ninth Circuit, it was held that affiliation exist without activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.978" offset="6895909">If congress meant to cover affiliation which certainly is a lesser and looser degree connection than -- than membership, it was put in there to cover a lesser and looser degree of connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.933" offset="6943660">It seems to me the implication of that is clear that Congress did not need a particularly high standard of activity as a requisite of membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.170" offset="6980650">Because if they have they would not have extended the statute also to cover affiliates.</text>

            <text syncTime="1779.235" offset="7116904">If the Court desires, I'll be glad to comment on -- on what happened on that pamphlet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.172" offset="7132682">Here, Mr. Justice Douglas made mention of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.511" offset="7141982">When I do not have nothing else to say, (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.972" offset="7151804">Mr. Justice Douglas that pamphlet is one of three which was offered during the trial by the prosecution to prove incitement by the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.774" offset="7195063">It was offered specifically by -- for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.279" offset="7205094">It was subjected to by the defense on the ground that it doesn't build an incitement, that it is indeed abusive, intemperant in its language, and all those things but as was observed by Judge Learned Hand of the Masses and Patten case, to be abusive is not necessarily to incitement to violent overthrown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.102" offset="7276356">It was then held before the jury as -- and the jury was asked to find incitement on the basis of that particular pamphlet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.498" offset="7313972">The defense then asked the trial judge to instruct the jury that they could not find incitement, unlawful action on the basis only of the -- of documents which criticized Government policy, I believe that was very severely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.819" offset="7375203">So that document played a very nature share.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.309" offset="7385234">Indeed, it is one of the principal thing that the Government relied on to differentiate the evidence in this case from the evidence in the Yates case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.261" offset="7416999">We say there is nothing in this case that isn't in the Yates case, the record is basically no different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.176" offset="7436643">This is one of the major efforts to make it and I have argued in our supplemental brief the importance of that.</text>
