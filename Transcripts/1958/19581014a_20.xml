            <text syncTime="22.828" offset="194644">This case has arisen out of the conviction of the petitioner James Clifton Hawkins in the northern district of Oklahoma for the offense of knowingly transporting one Lola Fay Moudy in interstate commerce for immoral purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.674" offset="278026">Petition for a writ of certiorari were filed and granted in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.417" offset="305089">The facts of this case are that one Lola Fay Moudy and the petitioner had a conservation in the State of Oklahoma and the witness, later became the witness Lola Fay Moudy, told the petitioner that she would like to make more money while she was working there in the tavern.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.295" offset="408534">And the petitioner asked her if she would like to go over to Tulsa and work with Jane.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.257" offset="432358">The witness Lola Moudy understood that working with Jane meant working as prostitute.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.565" offset="457644">Thereafter the petitioner and Lola Fay Moudy journeyed from a point in -- from a town in Oklahoma to a point in a town in Arkansas and then back across the line to Tulsa, Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.766" offset="530474">They arrived in Tulsa, Oklahoma at approximately 3:30 or 4 o' clock in the morning, when the petitioner got out his automobile which was identified as the car that the two people were traveling in by other witnesses, he got out of the car and made a telephone call and shortly thereafter a person named Jane and another person named Tommy came out to the car and Jane, Tommy and Lola Fay who was then being called Tommy McGuire went to a hotel where Tommy McGuire did not register but stayed in the room with Jane and Tommy and there they instructed her on various items of that business.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.144" offset="703927">And then later that day the petitioner by the way did not go to the hotel, but left, but later that day the -- Johnny McGuire or Lola Fay Moudy her real name, the main witness went to another hotel and there engaged in prostitution where she was arrested and then Tommy went down and paid a fine and got her out.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.966" offset="807267">Later she decided to quit and Jane, Tommy and Johnny, the three girls went back across to the State of Arkansas where the petitioner met them and then the prosecuting witness Lola Fay Moudy known as Johnny went back to the State of Oklahoma and thereafter did not engage in any prostitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.712" offset="914265">Now, this case was brought up on the main point that in this -- in the trial of this case, the petitioner's wife was allowed to testify as a government witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.588" offset="985736">She testified to only one or two facts which were not otherwise in evidence and those two facts were that she was the wife of petitioner and the person known as Jane Wilson.</text>

            <text syncTime="396.496" offset="1689370">The petitioner says that the trial court committed error in allowing the -- permitting the wife of the petitioner to testify as a government witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.862" offset="1738794">The rule that a wife could not testify for or against her spouse is of course a long standing was by the early treatise writer recognized and in the Maine case, the case often cited, the Stein versus Bowman case, cited in the 18th Century was repeated and in the case of US versus Graves, by this Court, was reiterated or repeated wherein the counsel for the prosecution commented on the failure of the wife to testify in his argument to a jury, and in that case the court says that the comment that the wife was an incompetent witness and that the comment by the prosecution on her failure to testify was therefore improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.073" offset="1975672">Later in 1933, this Court decided the (Inaudible) case which removed the restriction of the rule and permitted, a part of the rule, permitted the wife to testify for a husband, but left open the question as to whether the wife could testify against her husband, and that was in 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.130" offset="2083924">In 1935 the Tenth Circuit court in the case of United States versus Yoder, Yoder versus United States, had the same question presented to it as this Court now has with the exception that in that case at the time the wife was testifying against her husband she was divorced at the time of the trial, and by way of dicta they indicated that the rule that the wife could not testify against her husband had no further use.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.776" offset="2222477">Then the -- within a few years the two other circuit courts, three other circuit courts held that it was error for the wife to be permitted to testify against her husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.247" offset="2284335">Now, this is the present case is the first case where the point is raised directly, that is the first case where the wife was permitted to testify against her husband.</text>

            <text syncTime="581.672" offset="2430098">Now the early reasons given for the rule that the wife could not testify against her husband were mainly three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.327" offset="2472730">One was, that it was to preserve marital peace, in other words the peace of the marriage was felt to be more important than this privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.308" offset="2552560">And there that reason was given by Blackstone and Whitmore repeated in Stein versus Bowman and again in Yoder versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.355" offset="2592789">Now that marital peace reason still exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.262" offset="2608462">The doctrine that the wife cannot testify as to competential communications between husband and wife has the same reason and the government -- no one else has ever urged that the rule which will not allow the wife to testify as to privilege communication should be abolished.</text>

            <text syncTime="665.296" offset="2764570">That the second reason for the rule is that it would be naturally repugnant for the wife to be permitted to testify against her husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.280" offset="2812531">Now the respondent has raised in his brief that it is repugnant to be convicted of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.343" offset="2844714">He has the repugnancy running to the accused.</text>

            <text syncTime="712.829" offset="2954637">Now the third reason for the rule often given is that to forbid the wife to testify against her husband would hold invalid the marriage relationship.</text>

            <text syncTime="949.818" offset="3902673">Now in the light of reason which the Rule 26 says that this Court can interpret the common law rules of evidence in the light of reason, there is no reason for this rule to be changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.234" offset="3972263">By experience there is no reason for this rule to be changed in that the states, the 49 states, 48 states and the District of Columbia examined the petitioner show, that in those states that there were 13 states in which the wife was held competent to testify against her husband out of the 40, 49 jurisdictions and in 17 states held that she was competent but not compellable to testify against the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.593" offset="4165778">That is the reasoning used in the Funk case for the ablation of the rule that would permit the wife to testify for her husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.849" offset="4206738">They use that as a guide in showing that in the light of reason and experience, the rule should be changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.491" offset="4241324">Now in the Funk case the reason and experience had changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.324" offset="4272671">The reason that the wife did not testify for her husband was on the grounds of interest, that if she had an interest in the case and that her testimony would therefore be incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.915" offset="4331081">And after the different courts and legislators removed the interest disqualification and allowed the defendant himself to testify, then there the Funk case rightly removed the prohibition of the wife to testifying for her husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.821" offset="4474650">Now the first rule, the rule that we are concerned with which is the wife cannot testify against her husband, the states nor the jurisdictions have not overruled or have not stated in their opinions that these reasons for the rule do not exist, that is the preservation of the marital peace and the repugnancy of reason are to hold invalid the marriage relationship, those still exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.947" offset="4651133">And therefore the petitioner submits that the rule should not be changed but the reasons for the rule which would make the wife incompetent and the reasons for the rule which would make her non-compellable, and the reasons for the rule which would permit -- which would prevent confidential communications from being received into testimony are all the same and that they all still exist and that there is no reason now in the light of reason and experience why this common law prohibition for the wife to testifying against her husband should be abolished.</text>

            <text syncTime="1678.563" offset="6817625">It would decide the case favorably, as we think it should be decided and yet we think its farther the Court has to go, to decide this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.169" offset="6852002">We think that it is farther actually than right and justice and reason and experience required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.883" offset="6890872">Now I would like to make this point before going more into detail as to the question of reason and experience, which is the test in these cases, as the Court has a very broad latitude in this matters, historically it maybe of some interest as to how that pans out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.925" offset="6979062">The Judiciary Act of 1789, by Section 34 thereof, seemed to make a provision there that would dispose of all questions of that character, because it says that questions as to law, whether substantive or procedural should be decided by the federal courts according to the state law, or the state in which that court was sitting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.077" offset="7071640">However, they expressive language of that statute was never given much effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.964" offset="7095254">The Court from the first, found some excuses for going around that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.458" offset="7125243">In a celebrated case of United States against Reid about 100 years ago, the question was presented whether a Virginia statute affecting the admissibility of evidence, now on the Federal Court sitting in that street Chief Justice Taney reasoned that it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.909" offset="7202983">He said that would (Inaudible) the sovereignty of the United State subject to the sovereignty of the state making its own separate ruling on those matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.464" offset="7249272">And therefore it was the reasoning of the court that the provision of Section 34 did not apply to criminal matters and it worked out according to its own circuitous manner a rule whereby each state or the Federal Court in each state should apply the criminal procedural law of that state as it existed when the Judiciary Act of 1789 was passed and in the succeeding case of Logan which involved a state coming into the union after 1789, it was held that it should be the procedural law of that state or territory, at the time of its submission to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.435" offset="7437145">As you will see this bound the courts in something of a straightjacket as to the original 13 states they were bound by the law of 1789, by those coming in later by the law of the date of their admission to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.621" offset="7497853">So, sometime there had to be a break, something had to give, and in a succession of cases the Court pointed toward a more reasonable rule and in the case of Funk versus United States mentioned by Mr. King, 290 US, that rule was broken away from.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.956" offset="7579146">The particular question there presented was as to whether a husband or wife could give testimony in favor of the other party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.980" offset="7631287">In disposing of that and deciding contrary to common law, that the spouse could give testimony of that charactery, the Court said that reason and experience should be the criteria of such determinations by the Court and that the Court was not bound by the common law as of any particular date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.554" offset="7749569">That was restored in the Wolfle case and soon after was annunciated as rule, what is it 26 of this Court, in substantially the language of the Wolfle case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.606" offset="7837759">So it is now the law under Rule 26 that the Court shall return matters competency admissibility of evidence, the privilege all according to the principles of the common law as the federal court shall interpret them in the light of reason and experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.448" offset="7937128">And we are going to attempt to show that reason and experience show that we should not have any such blanket exclusion, as is contented for in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.776" offset="7986448">Before doing so I would like to make some reference to the case here and that other point which I believe perhaps is still in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.815" offset="8022601">I do not need to repeat the facts because they were quite accurately stated by Mr. King, one or two very minor exceptions, but you will recall of course that this is a case where the petitioner was charged with transporting a young woman, 17 years old for immoral purposes across state lines, and it began with her asking him if he could give her a better job or she knew -- if he knew where she could get a better job, and he suggested that she go work for Jane, and Jane happened was his wife who had been in Tulsa.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.624" offset="8169827">He himself took her up to Tulsa and although the original place was, they started out from somewhere in Oklahoma, they crossed over in to Arkansas and came into -- back into Oklahoma, and she thereafter engaged in prostitution in the (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.755" offset="8250389">Now the government called Jane, the wife of the petitioner, and she testified to the only two things as I see it, that is of any great importance in the determination of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.237" offset="8312351">First she said that she was a prostitute at the time of these occurrences, (Inaudible) she was at that particular time and she also said that the petitioner did not know her.</text>

            <text syncTime="2506.898" offset="10130996">The original rule was as I have indicated one of the (Inaudible) exclusion of all testimony of the spouse whether it was for or whether it was against, a spouse was on the trail and Blackstone whose name has been mentioned, states the reasons for the rule to be this, that a husband and wife were admitted to testify for each other, that would be against the maxim that nobody should be a witness in his own (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.149" offset="10271953">On the other hand if they should be admitted to testify against each other that would be against the maxim that nobody is required to be a witness against himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.617" offset="10333811">Now Blackstone is sometimes thought of as being (Inaudible) which you know no doubt is but this particular quotation that I have reference to, I think is a considerable value in showing the reason for the old rule and also showing to what extent the rule should be perpetuated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.487" offset="10421269">As to the first part of his statement, that no person should -- that no spouse should be admitted to testify for the -- I think because the rule is that no one can testify in his own cause that is going by the book.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.919" offset="10491068">Now persons are not disqualified by reason of interest to testify as defendant, they testify and therefore and the defendant's wife may testify for him, and that is still held in the Funk case and it is s4econd maxim that nobody should be required to accuse himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.290" offset="10572570">That of course is very much the rule of the day, and should be the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.093" offset="10603708">As we see it, the wife has an interest when her spouse is on trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.133" offset="10643937">Of course she has a property right in consortium.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.892" offset="10658983">She has a right of support.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.539" offset="10669537">She has other personal right which makes her interest coincide with that of the accused, her husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.884" offset="10710915">It is analogous to the rule that one should not be required to accuse himself that a wife should not be required to testify against her husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.080" offset="10779669">Looking to the matter of reason and experience, we will take first the question of experience, and that is best shown by a few decided cases as to how this rule actually works out in practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.946" offset="10847169">It works out with rather harsh results, which have resulted in the vehement criticism of the rule over a period of 100 years or so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.679" offset="10902131">Here is one case which the rule also in the State of Oklahoma, the same state as we are here concerned with, where a man, a farmer, took his little seven-year old stepdaughter out to work (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.605" offset="10985827">Actually nothing else entirely different occurred and he was tried for federal assault and convicted, largely on the testimony of his wife, the mother of this child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.201" offset="11040162">On appeal, that conviction was reversed because there is the old common law rule that a wife is incompetent to testify for or against her husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.796" offset="11118529">It is stating good law there they he said it was not fair play to make the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.644" offset="11149981">Fortunately with this Court it is the place of the Court to make the law in this particular case, because Rule 26 gives the right to decide the law as reason and experience shall dicta.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.300" offset="11232528">And I might add in that connection, that, that rule was passed under express legislative authorization, so there is no question of the Court invading the legislative sphere when it lays down, if it sees fit to do so on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.552" offset="11301595">A new rule regulating the matter of spousal privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.941" offset="11323120">Let me give you another case that shows how experience works out, a case arising down in Georgia, her husband went to the bedroom with his wife storming and threatening her with a gun, she stood up and clasped her child to her breast, and at that moment he shot killed the child clutched in her arms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.176" offset="11416116">She was allowed to testify by the lower court, and that conviction was reversed because he had a privilege to get the testimony of his wife under the common law and the same stated facts occurred in West Virginia, this time with the bullet piercing the child's head and wounding the mother, but it was still held on appeal that the testimony was incompetent under the old law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.686" offset="11558118">I might say right now is this question of incompetency, that's particularly falling with my offline, but whereas the original holding of the courts was that all testimony was incompetent, it was seen first that there was this position which I had mentioned, where the testimony was for the spouse and therefore they let that in because of spouse himself can testify, then it was seen with this other testimony, which was against the spouse was something in which nobody had any interest except for the two partners, that is husband and the wife, as it has sometimes been said, that, that privilege exists on the part of both her husband who is the accused and the wife who is the witness, and it is our position here while there is good reason for saying with the privilege on the part of the wife, there is no good reason for sticking with the privilege on the part of a husband.</text>

            <text syncTime="4337.221" offset="17452283">Well I think, rule 26, however, of course was approved along with other rules and the Rule 26 is the one which leaves it wide open to the court to make the decision which it deals as wide in all the circumstances of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4356.782" offset="17530546">That's -- that's our line of reasoning in this case Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4362.042" offset="17551548">Now the marital unity, not pardon me not marital unity but marital peace, argument or as a basis for the sustaining of the old common law rule breaks down in various respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="4384.719" offset="17642245">For instance, if a spouse is dead, surviving spouse may -- there is no marital unit, there is no marital peace, to be preserved and yet, there is the same question, should the surviving spouse be required to justify, we don't think she should because she has the privilege for her own, but the marital peace is no longer the underlying reason for sustaining the common law rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4413.601" offset="17757811">Another situation it comes up is where the testimony of the wife witness would incriminate her husband but he has not yet defendant in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4429.265" offset="17820400">Now there marital peace is involved just as much as if he were a defendant and yet the courts have held that she is required to testify marital peace there is not a good ground for sustaining the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4448.851" offset="17898768">And another situation shows the extreme results that may occur, is where there is a charge of bigamy the question to be determined by the court is which – is the wife of the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="4469.039" offset="17979538">Usually the first wife is presumably the legal wife is foreclosed from testimony and the second wife is allowed to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="4479.414" offset="18021021">Well she has been held in another case that the second wife if her husband is claiming her as being his wife then he claim a privilege against her testimony and she may not testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="4491.565" offset="18069608">As Wigmore says that leads to many identifying purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4497.235" offset="18092283">Another claim that might be drawn in at this particular point is the effect of this privilege on marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4510.006" offset="18143378">Sometime marriages take place in order to silence the lips of a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4515.013" offset="18163440">We have cited a number of those cases including one where the man married the 11 year old complaining witness in order to silence her testimony and he did succeed in doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4529.197" offset="18220178">Now as I see it, marital unity as it was formally seen, union actually in law of husband and wife is not more than conception that is out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4542.589" offset="18273677">Marital peace is a reason which this Court can well consider is the reason which is of not controlling importance, we do not believe and we do not believe it should be controlling in the face of the overriding necessity for testimony of all relevant testimony by witnesses who are willing to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="4573.258" offset="18396453">Now, another reason which is to justify the rule and that is, it is said that there is a national repugnance in matters of these kinds against spousal testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="4590.903" offset="18466983">First let us consider that from the standpoint of husband where he is trying to exclude the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="4599.229" offset="18500315">We think that is a very little weight there because her husband has got himself in this position, by his own wrongful act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4611.208" offset="18548172">And if he say that it's humiliating, some of the authorities has suggested, it is humiliating to be condemned by the testimony of one life partner, we say it's humiliating to be condemned in any case and that is not a weighty consideration certainly as against the interest of society on other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="4637.996" offset="18655378">There is, when you consider natural repugnance against this testimony, a question whether you should require a wife to testify when she doesn't want to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4651.926" offset="18711071">And, as I previously indicated although is not necessary for our position in this case, I mean its not necessary for sustaining the judgment below, that we take this position, we think that actually, all things considered there is great weight to the natural repugnance which is felt against compelling a wife to come in and testify against her husband and that is on reason that came to the -- reasons against self incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4686.070" offset="18847640">The reason against self incrimination is that nobody should be forced to position a perjury or (Inaudible) or testifying in matter which intimately affects their own lives.</text>
            <text syncTime="4704.069" offset="18919633">It's just as it was in the trial of Milton many years ago when the right of an accused was (Inaudible) makes is against the law of nature because nature is a preserver of life and this (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="4724.388" offset="19000926">The accused then is compelled to testify against – this makes him testify against his own wife and therefore it should not be required and the same reasoning applies we believe to compelling the wife to testify against her husband or if the partition be reversed to her husband testify against the wife.</text>

            <text syncTime="5107.212" offset="20532224">Well, I would like to confine my argument to what I figure is really the relevant matters in this case and that is we take no position that this Court is not got the authority to change this rule as the government has asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="5123.757" offset="20598366">We say this though, that if the rule is to be changed or altered in any manner I think you will in accordance to Rule 26 changes based upon reason and experience which is the very thing that prompted this Court to do in the Funk case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5140.460" offset="20665240">Now you will note from the record that the opinion of the Circuit Court is very short in that they simply say we follow the Yoder case and we don't even want to elucidate any further.</text>
            <text syncTime="5154.334" offset="20720724">So we must then go to the Yoder case determine why this particular Tenth Circuit Court and incidentally as the only circuit court to this very date to advocate this change, we have to go to the Yoder case to find out what their reason was.</text>
            <text syncTime="5171.307" offset="20788642">Whereas here that I think the whole point was missed because it is agreed by everybody that this rule which prompted the court to change the Funk case was based on an exclusion of the witness because of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5188.054" offset="20855620">It is agreed by all parties I think that the rule which we have under question is not based upon on excluding their testimony because of interest, if because of public policy had an endeavor to maintain and support we can domestic tranquility.</text>
            <text syncTime="5205.744" offset="20926360">So they are based on two different reasons yet and I quote from the opinion of the Yoder case which appears on page 19 of our approval -- our brief, which indicates clearly what the -- one of the court arrived at their decision in advocating the change of this rule that we are moving steadily in the direction of allowing the trier of the facts to hear all the witnesses, all of the evidence, the interest or the relationship of the witnesses to the party being given due consideration in weighing its value.</text>
            <text syncTime="5237.943" offset="21055195">Well now that was the point that was before the court in the Funk case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5243.062" offset="21075571">Now but this Yoder case then we think you are left to while testify but we are moving in the direction of allowing the trier of the facts to hear all of the evidence and determine their -- the testimony on its weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="5255.296" offset="21124577">Well that's not the point at all insofar as trying to maintain domestic tranquility it's not a matter of whether the testimony would have great weight or less weight it's a matter whether it would be against public policy to permit it and in the same opinion they readily acknowledge the wisdom of this exclusion of the communications between attorneys and clerks, and husbands and wife's and so forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="5308.919" offset="21339094">Well now it seems to me that this is an inconsistent stand to say we should allow a wife to testify what she has seen her husband do, but we should not for fear that we will violate the domestic tranquility, we will not let her testify to something he is told her that he has done.</text>

            <text syncTime="5621.395" offset="22589001">But I know what the Funk case did, the Court looked at what had happened in all of the other jurisdictions and we have made a check of those jurisdictions and we find that 51 of the of the 52 jurisdictions which includes the District of Columbia, the Alaska, Hawaii and Philippine Islands, 51 of those 52 are in complete harmony with the decision around that in the Funk case, and that it was in the Funk case that the Court decided, because of this overwhelming weight of authority, what the other states adopted, that they felt that the rule, the reason upon which that rule no longer existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5662.157" offset="22752005">Now we've also made a check on this particular rule, now incidentally Georgia was the only state excepting, Georgia still didn't permit a wife to testify for her case, her husband as the old common law rule was back for the Graves -- during the Graves case decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5679.833" offset="22822745">We have made a check now and we find that -- and I'd like to adopt the government's brief on this, because it's more in our favor, they find eight states, but we find that 17 of the 52 jurisdictions, 17 of the 49 jurisdictions is what it is are competent and compelling -- and are compellable, competent and are compellable.</text>

            <text syncTime="5745.152" offset="23083969">Now actually Illinois has a statute on it, but a case has come along and construed that and made it more clearly and I say with that possible exception Illinois you may have to go to cases already determined, but otherwise the decisions have been made legislatively.</text>
            <text syncTime="5760.561" offset="23145618">So it's our position in this case that the thing that confronted the Court in the Funk case was that they found by checking what the other states had done and what the other commentaries were saying about it, that the reason simply no longer existed, that that the public requirement for that change, but they don't -- you don't find that, that same thing doesn't confront this Court now because you find only a few of the states who advocate this change.</text>
            <text syncTime="5789.407" offset="23260975">So what we have is we actually have this 17, plus one circuit court because one (Inaudible) circuit federal court, not (Inaudible), that the Graves case was decided, then they, the Funk case was decided which knocked away one, then came another Circuit Court of Appeal which was the Paul case and it was decided after the Funk case, but it still went with the decision in the Graves case insofar as our rule was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5818.551" offset="23377586">Then came the Yoder case out of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeal and though it was -- the proposition was not before the Court because the wife was in fact divorced, they still by the way of dicta advocated the abolition of this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="5834.064" offset="23439653">Then came the Brunner case, after the Yoder case and they choose to go as exactly as did the Paul case and then came the Walker case as late as 1949 and they sat on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5846.846" offset="23490748">The Brunner, the Yoder, the Paul, the Funk, right on back to the Graves and they still go with the common law rule as it now exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="5857.941" offset="23535156">The Tenth Circuit of Appeals by way of dicta in the Yoder case and for the first time directly in this Hawkins case, is the only federal court yet which has advocated this change directly and the 17 states and that showed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5875.656" offset="23606000">Now the Walker case in its opinion said, we don't know whether the rule is going to be changed or not, we are not going to change.</text>
            <text syncTime="5883.637" offset="23637870">We will await action of Congress or the overwhelming adoption by the states as (Inaudible) to action in the Funk case before we will change our opinion and so they are still waiting for the overwhelming adoption by the states which obviously doesn't appear here, or the action of Congress or this Court, and I'll say this that the rule to be laid down in this case, all (Inaudible) the importance of this particular cases before the Court is going to be controlling many, many situations and not these particular isolated cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5925.403" offset="23804949">It is in my opinion the only thing really material in this case is the fact that the situation does not confront this Court, it confronted it in the Funk case because of the overwhelming majority of the states advocated the change in the Funk case, they do not in this case and that's what we call in the light of reason and experience, it shows that the reason and experience has not raised it's ugly head yet and clamored for a change of the rule, but on contrary have been content to stay with a common law rule of what we consider to be an intelligent ruling and one certainly of long stand.</text>

            <text syncTime="6018.773" offset="24178500">We are not dealing with the ordinary thing that you may be dealing with on harmless error rule. We are dealing with a statute now that will convict a man, not on direct testimony, but on -- because you can use circumstances and inferences in determining a man's purpose, and that's what this was, was an intent violation, that is he must have transported this girl for immoral purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6046.680" offset="24290095">Now you have to determine those immoral purposes from a set of circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="6052.176" offset="24312038">Now if it takes 50 pounds of circumstances to prove that, then how many pounds of circumstances was this wife's testimony?</text>

            <text syncTime="6075.727" offset="24406288">Since we're dealing with circumstances, how can we say that it was not the wife's testimony, her very presence of being in the courtroom, admitting to be being a prostitute, admitting that she had been a prostitute prior to marrying the defendant and that she was acting as a prostitute during the time that this case was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6097.601" offset="24493746">How can we say that, that was not the testimony that actually with all the other circumstances would ride on over and convince that jury that it was for immoral purposes that he delivered this girl.</text>
