            <text syncTime="30.834" offset="226722">So we have the result that the identical words appeal on two pieces of paper, one of them is called an answer in this suit and the other is called a libel in the independent suit that's still pending and they will be decided before the same judges and the merits of the case will be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.599" offset="293804">And that also satisfies the -- the requirement of Section 227 that you spoke of, Mr. Justice Whittaker because that only requires a new suit to be brought by the Government in case a judgment is recovered against the Government on the -- respondents claim here.</text>

            <text syncTime="210.578" offset="945716">Well, I think that that is probably so except that within the violation of the Admiralty Rule and that is -- that's in this particular case was because I think that the cross claim that the Government has set up is within admiralty jurisdiction but the moment you -- you depart from the rule, you get into all the troubles that you have in Admiralty where you have limited jurisdiction over the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.697" offset="1030144">You have actions in rem and you -- and all sorts of complications that would arise and that's one reason why I think that it would be wrong for the Court, on the basis of the facts in one particular litigation to make a change in the general rule which has existed for nearly a century and a half and presumably with good reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.779" offset="1114467">And it -- it should be done by independent rule making if it is to be done when all the pros and cons can properly be considered, but not on the basis of the record of particular facts in the particular case.</text>
