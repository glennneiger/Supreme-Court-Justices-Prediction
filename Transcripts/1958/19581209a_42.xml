            <text syncTime="376.327" offset="1608704">The reason I've two is to discuss 92 first, is because I think the Court will see that if that probably has to be passed upon before they can reach Article 2 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="388.204" offset="1656142">I'd like to read at Article 92 from the 1949 manual for court-martial, which was in effect at the time of this offense for which the petitioner is now serving his life sentence, specifies, “any person, subject to military law, found guilty of murder, shall suffer death or imprisonment for life as a court-martial may direct.”</text>
            <text syncTime="410.296" offset="1744541">And then I skip down the part that has -- “but provided that no person shall be tried by court-martial for murder or rape committed within the geographical limits of the States of The Union and the District of Columbia in time of peace.”</text>

            <text syncTime="585.422" offset="2445040">That in that particular case it involved the -- a petitioner who was confined in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas during World War I in July prior to the Armistice in July of 1918 wherein -- wherein this -- this man who was confined at Fort Leavenworth was alleged to have been involved in a murder there at Fort Leavenworth.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.605" offset="2549844">He was brought -- he was brought to trial on November the 4th after this offense was committed in -- in July of 1918.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.725" offset="2582235">And he was tried by a general court-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.092" offset="2591744">The court-martial took about 21 days with the delays and all.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.773" offset="2610448">So that the court-martial ended up by -- on November the 25th, 1918.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.299" offset="2628524">Of course, the Armistice was signed on November the 11th.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.063" offset="2643675">Well, the petitioner then, Anderson, came into court and on a writ of petition -- for writ of habeas corpus and he said that because of the fact that the war had ended, before the sentence was finally handed down, there was a loss of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.364" offset="2716818">And the -- and the Court -- the United States Supreme Court, rightly so stated, “No, that is not so, because we had jurisdiction over -- over the man.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.892" offset="2766973">It was in time of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.489" offset="2773347">The Armistice hadn't even been signed and we continued to have jurisdiction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="671.936" offset="2791111">Then they went ahead to say, “In time of peace means peace in the complete sense officially declared.”</text>
            <text syncTime="682.629" offset="2833847">Now, that -- that is the case on which the lower court and the Court of Appeals rejected the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.858" offset="2862791">I -- I respectfully call the Court's attention to the fact that I think that they've misinterpreted that case, very definitely, because, at first place, it's not at all like the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.546" offset="2905527">Because in our -- in the case at bar, whereas in -- in the Kahn versus Anderson, the -- the Armistice hadn't even been signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.540" offset="2937501">In the case at bar, the Armistice had been signed about four -- well, the shooting had stopped about four years earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.067" offset="2971669">The Presidential Proclamation was signed in -- on December the 31st, 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.231" offset="2996328">And the joint resolution of Congress was passed on July the 25th, 1947, which the army court-martial itself has stated, adopted into the new manual under Article 43, and it states there that the --the joint resolution of Congress of July the 25th, 1947, has the effect of terminating the war to -- with respect to punishment of certain military offenses when committed in time of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.854" offset="3130807">What they had to do under Article 43, which covers the statute of limitation, would make the determination as to when -- which offenses are committed in time of peace and which are committed in time of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.515" offset="3177409">The difference being of course, those that are committed in time of -- on time of war, many of these offenses do not have a statute of limitation, but in time of peace they have a three-year statute of limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.350" offset="3228818">In that connection, Article 43 (a) says, “A person charged with desertion or absence without leave in time of war or with aiding the enemy, mutiny or murder may be tried and punished at any time without limitation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="796.033" offset="3287542">Then it says in (b), “Except as otherwise provided in this article a person charged with desertion in time of peace or any of the offenses punishable under Articles 119 through 132 and they had included offenses -- offenses such as – such as assault, larceny, and various other offenses which apart from being in time of war would have a three-year limitation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="819.737" offset="3382314">And the -- and the footnote says, “An absence without leave from 7 March, 1947 to 5 February, 1949, having begun on a date prior to the adoption by Congress of the Joint Resolution of 25 July, 1947, terminating the war with respect to punishment of certain military offenses when committed in time of war was held subject to the operation of Article of War 39.”</text>
            <text syncTime="841.672" offset="3470085">In other words, they said, “That because that absence of leave or absence without leave began on 7th -- on the 7th of March, 1947, before the joint resolution of Congress, that it was a wartime, absence without leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.498" offset="3529331">And hence would not have the three-year statute of limitation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="861.070" offset="3547617">Now, the Government failed to take into consideration some very, very important cases and some of the most important of which are the cases which have handed -- been handed down by the United -- the United States Court of Military Appeals, which by virtue of being a court -- a court which deals specifically with military cases, had come to be expert in that field.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.512" offset="3653465">And they have had to pass upon the question of "in time of war" or "in time of peace" because we had this Korean conflict that came on.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.507" offset="3685439">And we had the same -- the Presidential Proclamation was passed at the beginning of the Korean conflict, it was of course, in June the 24th, 1950, which stated that these same offenses which otherwise would have been peace time offenses from July the 25th, 1947, became wartime offenses after the Korean conflict started as of June the 24th, 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.748" offset="3778330">So that -- many -- the United States Court of Military Appeals has had to pass on many cases involving AWOL which occurred after the Korean conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.687" offset="3814170">AWOL which -- and they've -- they've held universally that that's desertion if it occurred after the 24th of June, 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.779" offset="3846457">And so that's desertion and because it's desertion, it's desertion because it happened “in time of war.”</text>
            <text syncTime="941.661" offset="3869968">The Government in the -- the Government has made much capital of the fact but the Korean conflict was not a war because it -- it wasn't declared to be a war as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.462" offset="3909256">It wasn't started by Presidential Proclamation and because it wasn't ended by Presidential Proclamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.019" offset="3935483">But, I -- I submit what the United States Court of Military Appeals and this Honorable Court has also said in the same regard in the -- in the case of Ludecke versus Watkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.878" offset="4030882">And I'm now reading from -- from page 33 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.124" offset="4103920">In Ludecke versus Watkins, after a similar issue was before the war or before the Court except that it involves what we call war powers in that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.916" offset="4147075">It -- it involved the -- the power of -- of the aliens, the -- the right of the -- the Government to deport an alien without giving him a due process hearing, Ludecke versus Watkins 335 U.S. 160.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.034" offset="4215515">And the -- the Court laid down the rule there, the state of war may be terminated by treaty or legislation or Presidential Proclamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.048" offset="4255535">And what they -- what they said was any one of these things may terminate the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.462" offset="4285210">Now, the question is, of course, the Government contends that we -- we never -- we never got out of the war until 1952 when the Japanese Peace Treaty was finally signed and all that -- it was signed in 1951, it became effective in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.106" offset="4355845">But that leaves us with a paradoxical situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.942" offset="4367130">If we were never -- if we were at war from Pearl Harbor up until 1952, then why is it necessary for -- for the Court -- the Court of Military Appeals in -- in such a large number of cases to rule that we were at war when the Korean conflict started.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.253" offset="4448423">It certainly is a paradoxical situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.565" offset="4465664">It -- they're hanging their case on a mere technicality and not on the actualities of the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.738" offset="4498369">But the -- it's very interesting that one of the most -- two of the most recent cases in this connection are cases that -- which have been handed down by the United States Court of Military Appeals on March 15th, 1957, last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.755" offset="4558346">That's the case of United States versus Shell and United States versus Boston.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.230" offset="4576319">In those two cases, this very issue was before -- was before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.486" offset="4597321">When did the time of war for the Korean conflict begin?</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.888" offset="4614875">When did it end?</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.806" offset="4618637">Because they again had the question of these offenses which would carry a -- would be capital offenses in time of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.699" offset="4646118">Murder -- murder over in Korea and desertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.637" offset="4669942">They held in -- in United States versus Shell and United States versus Boston, and I quote, “In holding that offenses committed during the Korean conflict were perpetrated during a time of war, within the meaning of the language of a code, we reason that war does not result only from a formal declaration of Congress but can exist, in fact, without a declaration, and that its existence is to be determined by the realities of the situation as distinguished from legal license.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.178" offset="4800136">Now, the thing that is especially significant about that case is that they specifically stated that they have -- were overruling their prior holding of September 16th, 1954, three years earlier, wherein that same issue was before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.121" offset="4867845">And they had followed, in that particular case, they had followed Ludecke versus Watkins and Kahn versus Anderson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.584" offset="4905671">They state as -- as well as when United States Ex Rel. Knauff v. Shaughnessy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.309" offset="4932629">But it's very interesting that the court, in this later case, in 1957, in these two cases, specifically said that we overruled our earlier decision which had been based on Kahn versus Anderson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.734" offset="4978291">And -- and they have held in this particular case that -- that the -- when used in military law, the terms, “in time of -- time of war" and "time of peace" constitutes actual peace or war and not technical peace or war.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.905" offset="5070973">Now, if we are going to follow the Government's contention, what is going to be the result as far as all of these decisions which have -- had been handed down by the Court of Military Appeals?</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.793" offset="5114546">If we're going to follow the Government's details and say that we -- we reject -- we reject this distinction, these cases are wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.300" offset="5160521">The Court of Military Appeals and every case is wrong if you follow the Government's contention that we be -- we continue to be at war from Pearl Harbor up until the Japanese Peace Treaty passed in 1952.</text>

            <text syncTime="1385.366" offset="5644831">Of course, at that time we did not have the Court of Military Appeals and we didn't have it until after May 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.555" offset="5669595">But in this particular case, this case arose in 1950 -- in 1950 and involved -- it actually involved a question of whether we were at war on the 31st of July 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.148" offset="5751933">And the case went up on appeal to the -- what we call the judicial council which was then the judicial council which sat in the office of the Judge Advocate General, something more or less similar to the Board of Reviews which we now have all over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.571" offset="5809612">Of course, as I say we didn't have the Court of Military of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.579" offset="5821733">In that particular case, the question was whether we were at war or not because we have the -- we have the offense of a -- of a deserter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.700" offset="5882128">And the Court said the background, the extent, and nature of the hostilities between the United States and North Korean Forces on July -- on the 31st of July 1950 and the inevitable results of such hostility is up to that time in terms of casualties, again, matters of common knowledge and therefore proper subject to judicial notice are genuine proof of the existence of a state of public war between the two governments on that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.615" offset="6001873">And this involved a case of a fellow who deserted from an army camp up in -- up in Fort Lewis, Washington in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.748" offset="6046386">So the question was if -- is it a wartime desertion so that the capital punishment so that he can be -- be disposed of and court-martial may (Inaudible) to being killed or is it a peace time desertion?</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.996" offset="6099362">And the question was the Court had the rule and the judicial council as early as the 31st of July 1950 which was of course only about two months after the Korean conflict started said that we were in time of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.562" offset="6149622">Well, interesting in the same connection was a case which came up in -- in May the 8th, 1952 which arose when a soldier was sleeping on his post over in Korea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.980" offset="6203329">And in that particular case the Court said -- they said, “And the interpretation of Congress itself has placed on the hostilities by reestablishing certain wartime rights cause us to believe that when the President and Commander-in-Chief ordered members of the Army to service at the end of the conflict, he involved this country in hostilities to wit and to -- to such an extent that the state of war existed and that Congress, when it used the phrase “in time of war” in the military code, intended to bring -- to apply to that state regardless of whether it was initiated or continued with or without a formal declaration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.787" offset="6374484">Applying the rule which has been laid down in the Reid versus Covert and the Toth decision, I ask this Honorable Court, what is the reasonable relationship between the crime of John Lee, a dishonorably discharged ex-soldier, for the ethical offense of murder which allegedly occurred in June of 1949 by court -- by a general court-martial, instead of taking him over roughly 150 miles to the Federal District Court for the Southern Division of California and trying him by a federal jury where his constitutional rights among others, the fair right to a trial by jury would be respected?</text>

            <text syncTime="1691.840" offset="6870706">Chief Justice Warren, members of the Supreme Court, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.199" offset="6904142">My position on this case is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.982" offset="6919293">We contend that since John Lee had been discharged from the Army, he cannot be court-martialed by the Army that the then existent Article 2 (e) of the Articles of War, if interpreted to confer such jurisdiction is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.482" offset="7005288">I think before I start the presentations, it's important to keep several factors in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.880" offset="7030888">Primary among those is that here we are speaking of a capital offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.093" offset="7047711">We're speaking of the offense of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.230" offset="7064325">Second, we're speaking of an offense that occurred in continental United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.282" offset="7084492">It wasn't overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.323" offset="7088671">It was right here in the jurisdiction of our local District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.652" offset="7109987">It was an offense that occurred in 1949 and under the world conditions and the local conditions that existed in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.401" offset="7157008">It was a trial by -- of a person who had received and executed dishonorable discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.309" offset="7180622">It was a discharge that had been handed to him, differing from the common situation now, where a man is discharged, been given a dishonorable discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.237" offset="7224299">They frequently suspend the execution of that discharge until completion of the sentence.That is not this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1790.149" offset="7264005">The case would be different if it had been suspended dishonorably discharged, because then he would've been in the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.847" offset="7286784">Here, the discharge was issued, signed and in hand, delivered to the accused, to Mr. Lee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.464" offset="7325236">Lastly, here, we don't have the situation which occurred in the Toth case and the Hirshberg case as far as I know in the Covert and Reid case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.080" offset="7367659">This case, if -- we are not asking the Court to entirely release the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.754" offset="7394408">We're asking the Court in effect to turn him over to the Federal District Court for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.888" offset="7414888">It is not a case, like in Toth or Hirshberg where that he will escape prosecution if he was released.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.160" offset="7444041">He will be tried by the Federal District Court if he's released.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.477" offset="7457311">It's an offense within the province of the local Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.810" offset="7482598">The Court is aware.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.800" offset="7490539">The jurisdiction of court-martials as conferred by the Article 1, Section 8, Clause 14 and that is the only place that the Congress has authority to court-martial or to grant court-martial authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.748" offset="7550412">That article, of course, to that clause says that, you can try that make rules for the Government in regulation of the land and naval forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.526" offset="7585520">Then in the Toth case, you stated that this applied to persons who were, “actually members of the armed services.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.662" offset="7634004">In the Reid case you said “persons who are serving in the land and naval forces.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.192" offset="7664097">You, in a footnote, quoted Colonel Winthrop who is highly regarded as the grand father of the Blackstone of Military Law, who said that the law or the Fifth Amendment clearly distinguishes the civil from the military class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.605" offset="7737762">They're clearly distinguishable parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.591" offset="7757720">Colonel Winthrop also said that the law and you quoted in the footnote in the Covert and Reid cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.464" offset="7785200">You say, that -- or Winthrop says “that the law recognizes no third-class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.027" offset="7811532">You're either in the service or you're not in the service.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.511" offset="7829400">So that brings us down to which class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.754" offset="7842356">Which of these clearly distinguishable classes does a dishonorably discharged prisoner fall into?</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.149" offset="7879973">Well, we can look at him and look at his status and being in the service is a status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.218" offset="7904214">He has no contract with the military because the military has expressly repudiated his contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.391" offset="7936920">He performs no duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.950" offset="7947160">He renders no service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.433" offset="7957086">He receives no pay like Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Covert he is housed with the military but is not part of the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.040" offset="8015496">I think insofar as Covert -- the -- Lee is in the same situation as where the -- the parties in the Covert and Reid cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.138" offset="8059904">However, we can go further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.618" offset="8069831">The Army itself has said that a dishonorably discharged prisoner is not a soldier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.829" offset="8102640">Cited in the brief are opinions handed down by the Judge Advocate General.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.958" offset="8123225">He stated first, a dishonorable -- dishonorably discharged soldier cannot be tried for unauthorized absence because unauthorized absence contemplates a duty or to be out of place of duty, a dishonorably discharged soldier has no duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.955" offset="8199189">That's from the Judge Advocate General himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.128" offset="8211832">He can't be tried for disobedience of orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.819" offset="8230640">The Judge Advocate General says, “A dishonorably discharged soldier cannot be tried for disobedience of orders because he is not a soldier.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.755" offset="8270346">He is not entitled -- a dishonorably discharged soldier is not entitled to special services, equipment which is bought out of appropriated funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.183" offset="8308067">He's not entitled to that because according to the Judge Advocate General and that this was also a quote, “he is not a member of the military forces of the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.011" offset="8355401">Lastly, the Attorney General or the Judge Advocate General has held that dishonorably discharged soldier killed by the enemy is not in the status of “killed in action.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.949" offset="8407124">The reason he says and this is a quote, “A dishonorably discharged soldier becomes a civilian even though retained in confinement under sentence of general court-martial.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.878" offset="8450905">So clearly, the Judge Advocate General has held a dishonorably discharged prisoner to be a civilian.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.103" offset="8483819">We can go to Colonel Winthrop in his digest to the -- digest of opinions to the Judge Advocate General in 1895.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.544" offset="8521540">In that digest, the Colonel in 1895 arrived at the same conclusions or substantially the same conclusions that this Court has in the Hirshberg case and the Toth case, and in the Reid case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.662" offset="8570023">The Colonel insofar as the discharged prisoner is concerned says unequivocally that they are civilians.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.695" offset="8594160">The Colonel said that if Section 1361, which was the Section authorizing trial of dishonorably discharged prisoners at that time, if that Section authorized trial of dishonorably discharged prisoners, it was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.798" offset="8654555">The Colonel in his Military Law and Precedents, 1920 held the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.394" offset="8672946">He said that a dishonorably discharged soldier is a civilian.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.804" offset="8694575">Now, the Government's argument is this insofar as the necessity if the case is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.362" offset="8720802">The Government says, so we have a man here in a military prison, it's necessary that the military have jurisdiction to court-martial him so as to maintain the discipline and morale of their prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.914" offset="8775032">I submit to you gentlemen of the Court that that is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.189" offset="8800110">The head of a military prison has the same authority as a warden of any prison has.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.361" offset="8820799">He can put a person in solitary confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.447" offset="8829158">He can do this, that or the other thing to maintain his discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.284" offset="8844518">But there is no necessity of trying a man for a capital offense, of murder, when there's a local District Court which could also try him.</text>

            <text syncTime="2656.547" offset="10729514">The Court in the Toth and in this case has -- has put Colonel Winthrop to that effect in a footnote, but it does not expressly held that you have to be one or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.074" offset="10767653">Now, I'm saying that if the Court finds that -- that you might not have to be in the service to be tried by court-martial, in other words, if there's a class of person who was not actually in the service but can still be tried by court-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.427" offset="10821047">I'm saying that if that is the case, then the guiding factors there is to whether a person is to rely on the service the, the guiding factor is to whether the -- a person is in that category, if a person not in the service but subject to court-martial jurisdiction, then I think the rule is that that group of persons should be limited to those persons who the Court deems absolutely essential to maintain military discipline, and falling back a step, in other words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.972" offset="10947271">So, that here I don't think that Lee would fall in that category.</text>

            <text syncTime="2825.056" offset="11403577">Very last -- quickly, I'd like to touch on the question, which is going to be presented to you by the Government I'm sure, and that is the case of Kahn versus Anderson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.363" offset="11448822">Admittedly Kahn versus Anderson is the thorn in our side.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.445" offset="11469197">The Kahn versus Anderson decision was handed down in 1920 by the United States Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.621" offset="11489886">However, I think there are a number of things that distinguish Kahn versus Anderson in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.676" offset="11514128">First, if not most important, I think there's a question in the Kahn versus Anderson case as to whether or not it was an executed dishonorable discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.623" offset="11549863">The court said, “whether or not there was an executed dishonorable discharge it doesn't make any difference.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.173" offset="11576090">The most important factor of the Kahn case is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.168" offset="11592077">The Kahn case was based on prior cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.057" offset="11603571">It was based on Carter versus McClaughry Ex parte Wildman and -- and the Craig case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.047" offset="11655607">It was based on those three prior cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.102" offset="11663757">Now, first of all, if you take the Carter decision, the Carter decision does not hold that the military does not have jurisdiction of -- the military has jurisdictions to try and discharge prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.956" offset="11715166">So far as the Carter case is concerned, that is strictly dicta.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.250" offset="11728332">The Carter case holds nothing more than Coleman versus Tennessee, that is, that once a court-martial has started, once the man has been arrested with a view to court-martial, the military maintains jurisdiction over him up until a completion of his sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.980" offset="11787264">Captain Carter in the Carter case said that he was tried, convicted, given a dismissal, and five years confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.797" offset="11818611">He said after the Court gave him the dismissal, they lost their jurisdiction to carry out the confinement part of the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.775" offset="11846510">The Carter case stands for nothing more than a continuing jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.719" offset="11862288">Once jurisdiction attaches, it continues to the completion of the sentence, confinement or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.861" offset="11886843">In the -- in a statement in the Carter case to the effect that -- the military has jurisdiction to try to discharge prisoners is purely dicta.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.650" offset="11917981">There's another argument, this Wildman case and the other case, were based I think to a degree and so as the -- the Khan versus Anderson was based to a degree on the Fifth Amendment argument that the Congress derives authority from the Fifth Amendment to try or to give to the military court-martial jurisdiction over offenses which arise in the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.030" offset="12011499">This Court in both the Toth and in the Reid case has expressly stated that the Fifth Amendment confers no -- no authority to Congress to confer military jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.232" offset="12056325">One other point, the counsel in the Kahn case failed to point out to the Court in that case that the Judge Advocate General himself felt that there was no jurisdiction or that the Article 1361 of the revised statutes was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.173" offset="12124035">Counsel failed to point that out to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.701" offset="12134170">Another point in the Kahn case is that the offense in the Kahn case occurred in time of actual war.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.690" offset="12158098">It occurred during the actual shooting war of World War I.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.889" offset="12174921">Here, the offense occurred in 1949, which we contend was a time of peace in the actual sense, if not in the technical offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.035" offset="12207522">I thank Your Honors.</text>

            <text syncTime="3035.878" offset="12246915">Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.993" offset="12279306">Because of the limited time which is left before the Court rises for the day, I would like to turn my attention to the construction problem of Article 92, the time of peace matter rather than dealing with the constitutional issue which has just been discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.283" offset="12376482">I think that in the limited time we may be able to deal with the question of construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.232" offset="12412322">Now, the timetable which we have to have in mind in connection with whether or not this homicide took place in time of peace is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.930" offset="12463104">The incident occurred on June 10, 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.232" offset="12492257">Armistices had been signed in both Europe and in Japan in 1945, and the President had proclaimed the end of hostilities as of the close of 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.484" offset="12557354">However, the final peace previews and the proclamations of peace were not -- were not issued until -- for Europe 1951, and for Japan 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.703" offset="12622137">So that our question here is, in the light of this timetable what did Congress mean when it wrote “time of peace” into Article 92?</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.453" offset="12677204">Now, this is purely a question of construction, and I want to emphasize this because I think it draws a distinction between this type of case and the type of case which deals with war powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.841" offset="12726732">There are a group of cases in which the Court has had to consider whether or not Congress had power to take certain action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.666" offset="12766020">And it has power, the Court says, in time of -- in time of war which it does not have in time of peace because of the war powers specifically granted by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.333" offset="12808756">But this does not mean that Congress by making its own definition of war or peace can extend its powers indefinitely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.061" offset="12843656">The Court must look at the definitions it uses, the declarations it makes, and determine whether there -- whether they fall within the realm of reason because otherwise Congress could by its own act extend its own war powers which it cannot do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.608" offset="12909798">But here, the power of -- or the power of the Army to court-martial does not depend upon whether or not there's war or peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.969" offset="12955251">Congress could have said that they -- and in fact, does say in the present Articles of War, that murder may be court-martialed in time of peace as well as in time of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.842" offset="12994748">So our sole question is, what does Congress mean not what was -- what were its powers?</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.491" offset="13029334">Now, I suggest it is abundantly clear with respect to Article 92 that Congress did not intend to terminate court-martial jurisdiction prior to the final promulgation of peace, neither the Congress nor the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.716" offset="13098193">When the President made his proclamation of the end of hostilities, he was keenly aware of the problems of wartime legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.394" offset="13132988">And in the proclamation, he specifically stated that the state of war was to be continued, which was done with the idea that there were statutes dealing with war power and that he did not intend his proclamation to affect them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.592" offset="13197772">Then in 1947, Congress deliberately terminated the effectiveness of certain provisions of its statutes which would be effective during time of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.367" offset="13256808">And in doing this it went through an incredibly long list of statutes dealing with war powers, and it selected from them, individual statutes which it said are no longer necessary to be -- to be continued in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.016" offset="13323473">And it's interesting in this respect to note that it selected certain of the articles of war, of these same articles of war, which we have before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.308" offset="13360567">And considered that, as to them, the war should no longer be continued in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.346" offset="13384808">One of these -- one of these articles was the article dealing with desertion which carries a different punishment in time of war than in time of peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.021" offset="13419499">And for the purposes of construction of that article, Congress specifically stated that we now would consider it is no longer necessary to consider it a time of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.600" offset="13473729">The -- we have made reference to the articles which were terminated on page 45 of -- of our brief and we have listed also some of the other articles from the footnote which are dependent upon time of war or time of peace and which Congress specifically decided to -- not to affect by this declaration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.192" offset="13568188">Now, this Court has recognized the authority of Congress to define peace and war for the purposes of the articles of war themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.453" offset="13629210">I would refer the Court to a rather old case, McElrath against the United States 102 U.S. 426 which is cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.536" offset="13685530">By the power of the President which was limited to the time of war to dismiss officers without court-martial, court -- court-martial was upheld in a period between the end of open hostilities in the civil war and before the proclamation of the President that the war has been completed which came out in August of 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.932" offset="13791065">The specific question before the Court in that case was, was it proper for the President to exert these powers at this time?</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.118" offset="13831816">And there they said that the purpose of the -- of the -- of the statute was to have total peace, that's what Congress had meant and there was not total peace until the President had issued the actual proclamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.545" offset="13889599">Then we have the case of Kahn against Anderson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.438" offset="13905168">And in Kahn against Anderson, again, the question came up whether the war had been concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.933" offset="13931081">There are difference in -- differences in the facts between that case and this with respect to the termination of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.540" offset="13961488">In fact, the -- the petitioner in that case claimed that it wasn't a question of when the homicide took place but it was a question of the jurisdiction of the court-martial and that the court-martial terminated with -- with the time of peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.754" offset="14030346">This appears to be an extraordinary reading of the -- of the language of the statute but it's the way he read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.027" offset="14055528">And the Court in passing upon it, said that they must consider it -- must consider that the time of peace did not come until there was total peace and that the Armistice in 1900 -- in November 11, 1918 did not achieve total peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.158" offset="14123969">And then we come to the -- to the cases which were cited by petitioner with respect to the Korean conflict and with respect to the Court of Military Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.800" offset="14166601">I think there's nothing inconsistent in those cases with the position that we take here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.919" offset="14199097">The -- the reasoning of those cases is precisely the kind of reasoning that we have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.559" offset="14221563">The facts of -- are very different because you didn't have a declared war, you had a -- had a war which resulted as -- as from international action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.507" offset="14261373">And in that case like the -- in effect hold, that the war was terminated not when they stopped fighting and the Court will remember there was a period of uneasy truce while negotiations were going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.536" offset="14313514">But that for the purposes of the Korean conflict it -- it ended at the time of the United Nations agreement which terminated those hostilities being no declaration of war there was no occasion for -- for a proclamation of peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.978" offset="14379238">And I do not find in -- in those cases anything, although petitioner finds competent and I find nothing in those cases which in any way is inconsistent with the position which we take here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.105" offset="14435767">The Chief Justice asked whether there were decisions by the Court of Military Appeals which supported the position of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.150" offset="14475995">I think it's unlikely we will find those because of the fact that the Court of Military -- that the 1950 uniform code, which sets up the Court of Military Appeals became effective on May 31, 1951, and the period when one could appeal to the Court of Military Appeals is 30 days from the final judgment and it's unlikely that it might come up collaterally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.496" offset="14585396">And I can't say that there are no cases which deal with the period that Your Honor suggested but it's unlikely, and I know of none that have come up in the Court of Military Appeals with respect to that issue.</text>
