            <text syncTime="22.581" offset="193703">In this case, certiorari to the Eight Circuit tried in the Tax Court, there ruled against the petitioner on the grounds that there was lobbying.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.223" offset="256293">There was a practically similar fact situation as in the case described by Colonel Wiener and initiative in referendum measured opposed by the clients F. Strauss, Incorporated, a liquor wholesaler.</text>

            <label>Mr. E. Chas. Eichenbaum</label>
            <text syncTime="61.239" offset="348348">It was an initiated act.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.568" offset="361618">And the initiated act would have brought back prohibition to the State of Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.997" offset="395368">And I may say that in this case, there is no 90% question of whether or not the business of the taxpayer would've been destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.412" offset="437060">There is no question as to percentage.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.843" offset="454719">The record clearly indicates, and it has never been contravened, our taxpayer would've been out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.485" offset="501321">I should like to say that our record differs but it's likely with reference to the state of facts other than with that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.560" offset="557641">There are, in this record, a typical advertisement such as have been heretofore discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.712" offset="598183">I should also like to say, and I think that it is the crux of this situation that the ordinary and necessary expense undergone by this taxpayer apart from the regulation would be completely allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.888" offset="686895">I repeat, apart from the regulation, the expenditures would have been ordinary and necessary expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.552" offset="721586">Now, why ordinary and necessary?</text>
            <text syncTime="157.653" offset="734020">We may deal slightly with the elementals for a moment, but I think it gets back to something that was in the question by Mr. -- Mr. Chief Justice a few moments ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.518" offset="789400">What is ordinary in the sense of the statute and the deductions which are permitted under the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="178.275" offset="816462">Ordinary or the expenses in the sense that they are usual and customary in the business community and so to the challenge and so to defend is ordinary.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.255" offset="872364">I -- if I may say so that which embarks upon a new course, a new venture, again becomes an ad hoc situation, again becomes a matter for determination of whether it is ordinary and necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.878" offset="942895">But there can be no dispute that to defend the preservation of the taxpayer, I need not cite the well-known phrases in Heininger from the circuit court which is -- I have cited approvingly by this Court in the Levy case that if you have no business, you have no income, if you have no income, you have no tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.879" offset="1054908">In this case, ordinary is in the sense of the usual and customary and it becomes ordinary to defend against the challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.675" offset="1094092">And necessary is necessary, necessary in the usual sense and in the tax import.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.795" offset="1122513">Necessary, because it becomes appropriate and helpful and in this sense, necessary for survival.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.313" offset="1152606">So, apart from the regulation with which we shall deal in this case expense allowable ordinary and necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.661" offset="1198059">Now, we take the position and we differ slightly probably only in the order of presentation with our Brother Colonel Wiener, we take the position that the regulation does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.500" offset="1245393">We take the -- the position that it is not intended by its terms so to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.280" offset="1268485">Now, the reason that we take that position is that we say that legislation, in its ordinary sense, does not include the initiative and referendum procedures or the constitutional procedures of amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.859" offset="1326791">And we advance that reason for -- on two bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.093" offset="1351764">The first is that we think that it may well have been out of contemplation of Congress in the enactment of the statute or out of contemplation by the Commissioner in the promulgation of the regulation that those appeals directly to the people should have supervision or governing restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.625" offset="1433893">Now, we do say that with reference to such basis that Luther Ely Smith is, of course, highly significant and the acquiescence of the Commissioner for the period of 14 years which we shall touch upon in the matter of the question of reenactment again even more highly significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.494" offset="1525321">What we say beyond that that the purpose of the regulation, if not, if -- if applicable to matters of all technical character in legislation and one can characterize technically initiative in referendum procedures and constitutional amendment as a type of legislation, we say that the purpose of the safeguards are to reach the influencing of legislative procedures so as to safeguard against improper acts, that is to say that the regulation, the regulation itself is not applicable because it is intended to pertain to illegal activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.183" offset="1732106">And why may we say that?</text>
            <text syncTime="409.318" offset="1740675">We say that because of all reasons Textile Mills decision itself indicates the applicability.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.505" offset="1781426">Those were not idle words that were written when defining the -- the prerogatives of determination by the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.164" offset="1828028">This Court said that ordinary and necessary may be construed and interpreted to mean -- to -- to convey certain meanings, and what meanings?</text>
            <text syncTime="448.996" offset="1899395">Meanings of ordinary and necessary as distinguished from the illegal and not necessarily always the definitive certainties of illegality.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.732" offset="1958327">In Textile Mills, there may have been no certainty upon which -- that some could be placed.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.935" offset="1987062">But as the Court said, it belongs to that class of contracts, that class of contracts which might be and which you use the word “tainting”.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.401" offset="2044949">Ordinary and necessary have their specific meanings in the interpretation of tax law in the opinion in the Hubert case.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.150" offset="2083924">Necessary had a certain meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.944" offset="2095104">It was not necessary to violate the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.915" offset="2110986">It is always within the prerogatives of the Commissioner to interpret, interpret but not extend.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.463" offset="2149230">Interpret but not subtract from the substantiality of the provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.347" offset="2180786">Why do we argue initially that the regulation is invalid?</text>
            <text syncTime="525.111" offset="2203773">We do it for a reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.152" offset="2212028">Because we say that by giving this interpretation, we have avoided the question as under the rules of interpretation, we think we should proceed to avoid the questions of constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.670" offset="2274095">Because certainly, if applied, I will say in -- invalidity and unconstitutionality, because if applied to ordinary and necessary expenses to the same degree, as may have been argued in the preceding case, to ordinary and necessary expenses, it is an obvious over extension of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.135" offset="2379943">Applied so, applied so the regulation, applied to the facts in these cases, constitutes a reaching out into the area of legitimate business expense and ringing from the business itself the right to defend.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.919" offset="2475029">Now, why constitutional?</text>
            <text syncTime="596.178" offset="2488090">And we think this is a necessary position which we must take.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.994" offset="2515362">We think that it is apparent, that not only as counsel for the Government has stated in the companion case, not only our deductions matter of -- matters of grace, but deductions when extended cannot be invaded for the purpose of distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.683" offset="2622151">And there, if we may say so again, we urge that Speiser versus Randall, First Unitarian Church obviously extend to a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.472" offset="2669275">It is more than a deduction immunities granted under the law cannot be invaded justly.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.916" offset="2695084">Deductions cannot be invaded justly.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.010" offset="2707414">Now, let's talk about establishing a tax equilibrium, that sounds very good except that there's no tax equilibrium between one who has income and one who has an income.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.464" offset="2753181">There is no tax equilibrium between the individual and the corporation, between the individual who is in business and not making income, not earning income and one who has.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.849" offset="2806784">A tax equilibrium has no place here.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.276" offset="2824443">Nor do I think that tax equilibrium has any point in the history of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.465" offset="2849207">I should like to touch upon that history.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.253" offset="2860387">I think it varies upon the question of reenactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.847" offset="2878777">Now, there has been mentioned here and I touched upon the arguments which preceded of that during this period in which the regulation was on the books that there was only one case, the Luther Ely Smith case, the Tax Court case.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.362" offset="2964773">I beg to differ.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.975" offset="2971251">Now, let's see what cases there were during the period prior to 1939 as being recognized by counsel in statement that post 1939, no enactment to the tax year.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.744" offset="3030392">Well, now, we recall Lucas versus Wofford, Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.541" offset="3045543">What was Lucas versus Wofford?</text>
            <text syncTime="737.502" offset="3053380">Well-known to this Court, appearance before legislative committee, deduction allowed, ground legal methods of presentation in matters of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.502" offset="3105416">Los Angeles and Utah Rail -- Los Angeles and Salt Lake City Railroad Company and all the companion railroad company cases which, as the Court will recall, were the cases in which railroads subsequent to World War I and the time in which the Government took over the operation of railroads were about to return them.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.049" offset="3207607">And all the railroad companies filed, issued it -- advertisements with reference to the type of legislation and the type of conditions because it would be done by legislation that the railroad should be returned in.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.464" offset="3273226">Now, during these years -- during the years pre 1939, there was no single instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.999" offset="3311365">No, I -- I am in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.142" offset="3319933">There was.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.661" offset="3322023">There was one case, and it was not in accord with the majority, the Sunset Scavenger case, if I may refer to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.160" offset="3352012">But all other cases during that period, completely distinguished the legal from that which was within the tainted class from that which the Commissioner should properly define and determine and interpret.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.600" offset="3429752">And so, up to 1939, what was the situation?</text>
            <text syncTime="837.996" offset="3455352">Could there be acquiescence by -- and the Eighth Court suggested that there might be reenactment by acquiescence with reference to cases which favor the petitioners?</text>
            <text syncTime="851.600" offset="3509791">And I should add that Textile Mills in setting forth that the purpose of the regulation was to permit the Commissioner to define that class, that deduction which should be disallowed only again serves to point up the reenactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.803" offset="3610624">Reenactment is the acceptance of long, well-continued, well-settled rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.839" offset="3638732">Now, did that exist here?</text>
            <text syncTime="885.459" offset="3645210">Counsel would indicate it existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.641" offset="3653987">But I have this to say about the position of the respondent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.875" offset="3682826">Certainly, one would think, certainly one would think that the person most likely to know that rule if it existed would be the respondent, would be the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.084" offset="3731728">But up until 1950, the year our tax year involve the respondent himself, the United States Commissioner of Internal Revenue was himself interpreting, was himself interpreting the regulation not as counsel has argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.359" offset="3828799">There is in the Research Institute of America Inc., January 13, 1950, tax service, and I -- I must suggest that the authority is not as authentic as if I were able to learn something -- bring something of higher authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.765" offset="3914480">The announcement of the Internal Revenue Service ruling regarding the deduction of contributions to Colorado United Inc., and there, the contributions by brewers to the organization were allowed as a business expense deduction in the ruling obtained for the United States Brewers' Foundation.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.112" offset="3995773">The Appendix D, this happens to be a brief of amicus curiae in the Court of Claims, I -- I must apologize that we didn't have it in our own brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.369" offset="4036838">The Commissioner of Internal Revenue under date of August 11, 1950 just about the time that our taxpayer was serving his business, was saving his business address the communication to Mr. Howard T. Jones, Executive Secretary of the Distilled Spirit Institute in which he answered the request for the ruling of the bureau in connection with Colorado United Inc.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.612" offset="4137775">And I quote, “The Bureau has not issued any published ruling in this matter but it has held that contributions to Colorado United Inc. by taxpayers engaged or financially interested in the alcohol beverage industry are deductible under Section 23 (1) A of the Internal Revenue Code.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1757.087" offset="7131721">The first thing, as I said before, it involve litigation expenses which has a different history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.786" offset="7150529">The second thing is, that there was no regulation involve there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.057" offset="7163591">And at the very beginning of this opinion, Mr. Justice Black for the Court said, “We do not have here the aid of an interpretive regulation of the Commissioner as we had in the Textile Mills case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.238" offset="7208312">So that there, the Court was being asked to decide a question without the aid of the -- of the regulation and the history which we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.381" offset="7240913">And the third thing about that case was that the aspect of destruction of business, I think, was not central to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.397" offset="7268916">I think that if Dr. Heininger's business had not been destroyed, but just been seriously affected, but it -- they didn't stop all this math only part of this mess, the decision of the Court would've been the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.343" offset="7308727">And certainly, since -- decision of the Court went on the ground that the -- that the postal fraud statutes did not require the disallowance of his litigation expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.022" offset="7351463">And that would've been true whether his -- his business was destroyed or whether his business was only seriously affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.884" offset="7374869">So that on the whole I think that the Heininger case does not control this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.091" offset="7399737">I don't deny it has a bearing on the case -- on the case, but I think it doesn't control the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.634" offset="7421889">The -- back for a moment to the issue of the matter of tax equilibrium if I may be pardoned to use that shorthand expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.625" offset="7461909">I would like to -- to point out one further thing that I think failed to make clear to the Court, and that is that in this day and age when there are an awful lot of initiatives and referenda throughout the country on all matters of importance involving matters of taxation, matters of regulation, matters in which the public is -- is largely concerned and then -- which industries are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.571" offset="7549680">What you will have if businesses can deduct their publicity campaigns is a great advantage to the larger businesses which have -- which have better -- which have higher rates of taxation and therefore get a greater benefit from their expenditures, that is --</text>

            <text syncTime="1900.582" offset="7705684">On the other side here, there are other businesses maybe or private citizens who also have an interest as private -- as citizens in the adoption or defeat of the proposed legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.127" offset="7747897">And it's not only -- if the corporation, if that's true, with individual taxpayers, it may be even 70% to 80% of the Government would bear in -- in -- and we think this is an important factor that this is not an issue which relates only to this particular tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.628" offset="7809860">But it also relates to things as the -- as the Court knows are going out throughout the country today that is more and more, these issues are coming before the public in initiative and in referenda.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.655" offset="7853955">And they're very important issues relating to taxation and -- and business regulation.</text>
