            <text syncTime="20.805" offset="186598">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.086" offset="199764">In these cases I represent Public Service Electric &amp; Gas Company which is a gas distribution public utility in the State of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.032" offset="235499">We serve over 1,100,000 customers and have large purchases of natural gas from three pipeline companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.396" offset="276982">We purchased for example a 1958 already 8 million MCF of natural gas, which by coincidence is slightly larger than the entire amount which will be delivered at Tennessee under these contracts per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.396" offset="328913">Now, we are rightly interested in the field price of gas in these cases because the field price of gas is a large element in the price which the pipeline company charges the distribution company.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.627" offset="381889">Now, in my argument, first, I would like to try and cover two points which I felt were prompted by questions from the bench yesterday and these two points are (A) the rate making standard of the act in connection with the Commission's discretion in a Section 7 proceeding and 2 or (B), what's a touch off Commission action, and what evidence is necessary where it appears a producer is seeking too high of price?</text>
            <text syncTime="95.564" offset="485648">Taking up the first point, I agree that the Commission has a certain amount of discretion which it may use in the Section 7 proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.518" offset="517413">And in the exercise of that discretion, it need not make a finding of just and reasonableness with respect to the initial rate in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.289" offset="552521">What this discretion must be exercised within the framework and policy of the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.261" offset="588466">The cases for example which express that policy are the Hope case and the Phillips case, and the policy as this Court interpreted was namely to protect consumers from exploitation at the hands of natural gas companies.</text>

            <text syncTime="194.530" offset="881455">I say that the Commission's discretion in a Section 7(4) proceeding must recognize that Section 4 points out that this is a price oriented statute and that Section 7 provides all rates must be just and reasonable, and if they are not, they are declared to be unlawful.</text>

            <text syncTime="221.381" offset="988871">Let me just say it Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.725" offset="994304">Section 4 does not exclude initial prices paid to producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.817" offset="1014680">However, and this is the point I think that answers your question, the precise time at which the Commission must make such a determination of just and reasonableness maybe left to a later time, outside the Section 7 proceeding, after it has concluded provided, and only if, it protects the consumer in the meantime, the waiting period.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.291" offset="1096495">As this Court said in the Hope case at 320 US at page 611, the Federal Power Commission was given broad powers of regulation for fixing of just and reasonable rates under Section 4 with the powers attended there too, was the heart of the new regulatory system.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.929" offset="1171101">I believe Justice Harlan asked Mr. Brown yesterday a question to this effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.727" offset="1194297">Isn't the nub of the problem that producers want a Section 5 proceeding and you want a Section 4 proceeding?</text>
            <text syncTime="279.436" offset="1221151">The unequivocal answer to that question is yes, but it must be understood that there is no way to provide for a Section 4 proceeding unless a condition calling forth is placed in the certificate which is issued in the Section 7 proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.338" offset="1288756">In other words, the two must be in conjunction because you cannot initiate a Section 4 proceeding, the pipeline itself must do that or the producer rather in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1092.497" offset="4473396">It's true that in the May 20th Order, they had adopted the price, that is the Commission did, as a condition, the price of 18 cents per MCF which were being paid 200 miles for the East, but this was a new pricing area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.996" offset="4539329">They did not find that that 18 cents was the market price being paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.620" offset="4557824">On the contrary the New York Commission recognizes that the market price for natural gas in Southern Louisiana before this contract was ever made had reached 20 cents per MCF for onshore gas and I refer particularly Your Honor, I would like to call the Court's attention to the New York State Commission brief at Page 23, where the New York State Commission points out that in 1953 and early 1954, now this was before even the Phillip's decision on June 7th, 54 by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.260" offset="4700453">Two paper pipeline companies as they called, because they weren't in operation, were paying from 17 to 21 cents per MCF, the New York Commission says in 53 and 54 in Southern Louisiana and the FTC granted certifications without price limitations or conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.355" offset="4780805">Now that's three years before the contract in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.797" offset="4794598">Then they referred to the order of the commission on May 20th, 1953 in the Gulf Interstate Gas Company case which set a price in Southern Louisiana, the initial price of 20 cents per MCF to be paid for gas from the Iraq field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.663" offset="4861994">So there you have, three years prior to the execution of the contracts involved in this case, 20 cents being paid for onshore Southern Louisiana gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.853" offset="4910791">So the market price had reached that level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.541" offset="4921553">Now here was a greater prize as a larger reserve because the reserves involved in the Gulf Interstate Gas and the Iraq field and also in the other fields for smaller quantities of gas and also the record shows in this case if other companies were paying in the range of 20 cents per onshore gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.786" offset="5002533">Now here was gas discovered in 90 feet of water, 25-30 miles off the Southwestern shore of Louisiana, and in view of this evidence and this record, and here was a larger supply of gas we think that the this price was inline with the market price being paid onshore.</text>

            <text syncTime="1661.446" offset="6749184">Now for instance, in this 5 (a) proceeding involving Cities Service, in this case, which is one of the producers here, it is a combination of 4 (e) and 5 (a) case, because here is the case where the Commission, by the 4 (e) case, may have consolidated 4 (e) with 5 (a).</text>

            <text syncTime="1715.853" offset="6966836">So it's just like in any lawsuit, once the evidence gets on the way it's never cited as a general rule which one had the obligation to go forward first.</text>

            <text syncTime="1744.004" offset="7079372">Mr. Searls I was wondering why in one of these later cases such as we have here it can be anticipated that the decision of the Commission would be made early this fall, where on the other hand none of the older cases have been decided and the Phillips case, which was as far back as 1954, it's not if then decided.</text>

            <text syncTime="1783.113" offset="7235793">Not necessarily so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.545" offset="7241540">Now I think I could answer that this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.421" offset="7253034">The Commission has been pioneering of course in these producer cases, those that never had this issue before it until after the decision on June 7th, 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.213" offset="7296188">Now after that decision they had to lay down certain rules to be followed, and whatnot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.334" offset="7316668">Now when the Commission decides the Phillips case, which is already been decided by the examiner and which resulted in $9 million annual increase for Phillips, under the examiner's decision in a 5 (a) case, when that's decided undoubtedly a number of standards will be set which will expedite the handling of these other rate cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.847" offset="7414784">Up to this point we have not had a decision to set the standards in determining how you ascertain a just and reasonable price for the producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.746" offset="7454386">So I would say to answer Your Honor's question as soon as we get the first case decided, setting those standards we will be able to move forward much faster.</text>
