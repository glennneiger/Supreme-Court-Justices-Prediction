            <text syncTime="236.894" offset="1050937">How do you reconcile that statement Mr. Solicitor General, the stipulation in paragraph where it says, considering the following evidence, the FCC had a duty to and did consider whether the evidence support your -- in violation of antitrust laws.</text>

          <turn speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="254.628" stopTime="496.947">
            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="254.628" offset="1121886">We -- we believe that stipulation involves this.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.803" offset="1138604">That the Commission could properly have considered and did have a duty to consider, whether or not there was such a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.988" offset="1175280">And it could have determined within the stipulation that there was or that there was not such a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.243" offset="1212374">And even if it did, the consideration that it was determined -- it was to pass on was not whether that was a violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.646" offset="1262007">But what it was determining was the public interest, convenience, and necessity under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.799" offset="1290533">Now, to depart a moment on that, if you recall this Court in the case of Federal Communications Commission against RCA Communications, in the case involving whether or not the Mackay Telegraph Company would be allowed to extend its lines, the radio communication in foreign areas to The Netherlands and to Portugal.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.331" offset="1416652">The Federal Communications Commission determined that that application should be allowed to those two points on the basis that it would be -- it would provide more competition, and it made the decision only on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.044" offset="1483525">And the Court reversed because it held that competition was not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.333" offset="1508707">But the Commission was considering the element of Statute 313 regarding the application of the antitrust laws and thought that competition itself was the element that was enough to be controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.584" offset="1573700">And this Court reversed that decision and sent the case back to the Commission to determine according to the proper standard not merely whether or not if the competition was involved or whether competition would be benefited under Section 313.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.529" offset="1645484">But whether or not under its basic statutory duty, the public interest, convenience, and necessity would determine that these extensions should be made so that taking into account that case, and the duty of the Commission by the statute the Commission could have found either that there was a violation or there was not, but that was not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.733" offset="1750288">It had to move on from that point and determine what effect that violation would have upon this applicant's right to have his application -- his application granted to have these particular stations exchanged.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.459" offset="1813191">And in that determination there could be many factors that -- it must necessarily considered including the question of -- of its programming ability, its financial ability and all the other elements that go into the consideration of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.084" offset="1883721">Now, the fact is that the Commission says that it did not consider that if -- it had the responsibility for determining.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.717" offset="1926248">And it has a memorandum here before the Court and what it says, that it didn't have the responsibility of determining the antitrust features of this manner as such, but it doesn't withdraw at all from the proposition that it has a duty to consider them as they bear upon the public interest, convenience, and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.407" offset="2024991">So keeping that in mind, the difference between the standard that they must apply and the elements that are involved in antitrust enforcement, it seems to me that this case becomes clearer as to the proper disposition.</text>

            <text syncTime="512.735" offset="2154350">The Commissioner said we're not concerned, we'll -- we'll -- we'll take it all.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.952" offset="2175143">We're really -- we're really not concerned whether this have been a violation of the antitrust laws here if, unless we find that the thing -- that this exchange is not otherwise in the public interest, and that we find it is why the antitrust law violation is something that we're not considering but with that -- we'll do that -- that would have been a good sustainable order of the Commission?</text>

            <text syncTime="539.318" offset="2260616">Well, I -- I think it would, Mr. Justice, providing they first reach the point of whether or not the public interest, convenience, and necessity was served if they concluded it would not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.824" offset="2306696">I don't think they had to reach the antitrust issue at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.078" offset="2319653">But if they would consider that otherwise all the other elements would justify and they would entirely disregard the antitrust feature.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.518" offset="2365419">I think the NBC case by this Court in regard to the network regulations requires them to consider the antitrust feature as a part of the public interest, convenience, and necessity measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.728" offset="2418291">So, to answer your question if it's not -- if I haven't made it clear, if they don't reach the question because they already find that the application cannot be approved because it is not in the public interest, for reasons involved in that, other than the antitrust.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.638" offset="2489971">It seems to me they don't have to go as far as to consider the antitrust issues at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.454" offset="2509197">But if they find everything else and they completely disregard antitrust issues, then I think its error under the NBC case.</text>

            <text syncTime="652.658" offset="2713997">And they aren't expected under the law to determine that question except for a limited purpose of the public interest, convenience, and necessity.</text>

            <text syncTime="670.687" offset="2786095">Is it conceived for a moment that if the Commission had held against them on the antitrust and made such a finding that it could bind RCA, who was not a party in the action, and the Government was not a party, in such a later proceeding, wouldn't the RCA say, "We had no trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.550" offset="2869582">We had no hearing on this Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.550" offset="2881599">We'll be involved at all kinds of trouble damage actions in relation to this matter by such a holding.</text>

            <text syncTime="712.431" offset="2953070">And the incidental feature of the effect of the antitrust relationship on the public interest, convenience, and necessity certainly cannot bind us, and preclude us from a proper hearing in the court of law on the other issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1980.432" offset="8025109">And not give it to -- in Pittsburgh where it was requiring a new station unless it gave in to this exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.807" offset="8062621">And the exchange was a very valuable and attractive proposition for NBC and RCA and that the property they paid $3 million additional for the exchange over the -- exchange in the Cleveland station but the property was worth over $1 million a year according to the claims of the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="3630.612" offset="14625834">Although, it did not take the appeal which the statute expressly provided in the exclusive way provided by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.187" offset="14660106">Although he concedes that the Department of Justice has no new facts which have developed from the day the application was acted upon by the Commission until the day the complaint was filed and presumably certainly until today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.467" offset="14721233">Nevertheless, he urges upon this Court that when the Department of Justice later concluded on the identical facts that the transfer was not as the Commission found in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.476" offset="14773269">The Department should be permitted to maintain a suit in the United States District Court or the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for the purpose of setting aside as null and void, not a conspiracy, but the very transaction, the very transaction which the Federal Communications Commission approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.175" offset="14856025">Now, I say to Your Honors that in an effort to justify that really remarkable position, and one completely without precedent, we have studied every page we could find.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.910" offset="14898970">And I am comforted in our conclusion that there was no precedent because the Solicitor General who is of course always very efficient has cited none.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.430" offset="14937109">In an effort to do that, what does he do?</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.576" offset="14945677">Well, he broadens the issues into questions of conspiracy, into questions of Sherman Act, into broad general policies, which I shall endeavor to narrow to present to Your Honors just what the issue was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.041" offset="15007535">And he avoids what is really a very simple statement of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.933" offset="15027075">So simple that when we before the trial court said, “No, we prefer to go ahead.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.996" offset="15051316">And try the space against the framework of a full presentation of all the facts, it was the Government as this record shows, who said, “No.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.435" offset="15081096">It was the Government who appeared before Judge Kirkpatrick and argued vigorously, and had several people there to say what's the use of trying to this case since all the facts can be conceived now?</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.457" offset="15129161">And if the defendants are correct, the Government doesn't want to proceed with the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.490" offset="15153298">And so we entered into a stipulation of facts and there are -- while the stipulation has 13 averments, I may say to Your Honor that just -- Your Honors that just a very few, actually three or four numbers are significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.009" offset="15219440">The stipulation does explain that the facts of this case are rather simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="3789.873" offset="15262908">NBC had -- no, Cleveland stations, Westinghouse, and Philadelphia stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3795.467" offset="15285269">NBC, pursuant to the Commission authority, as Commissioner Doerfer say in the opinion to which the Solicitor General has referred, had a affiliation with Westinghouse which it had the right to renew or not to renew as it saw fit within two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.279" offset="15352456">This is something which the Federal Communications Commission in the full wisdom of its regulatory authority has decided it's good for the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.763" offset="15386415">And I take it that this is something that is not before the Court matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3824.655" offset="15401984">And in the exercise of that part it sat down with Westinghouse and it said, “We think we need the Philadelphia station.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.509" offset="15433435">We're in the eastern part of the -- of the State of Pennsylvania to a much greater extent; you're in the western part, we have the Cleveland stations.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3841.425" offset="15469066">And in any event they worked out a deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3843.709" offset="15478157">And the deal simply was that Westinghouse would get the Philadelphia -- the Cleveland stations and that -- that NBC would get the Philadelphia stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3852.296" offset="15512534">And because the difference in earning power when capitalized came to $3 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3857.606" offset="15533746">Westinghouse would get an additional $3 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3860.019" offset="15543463">Now, that's the whole deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3861.677" offset="15550046">That's the entire transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3863.803" offset="15558614">And I may say in answer to Mr. Justice Whittaker as to whether the Commission passed upon these facts that I need only to read to you a statement from the opinion by Commissioner Doerfer which appears at page 163 of the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="3886.681" offset="15650147">He writes it for himself and one other Commissioner in answer to Commissioner Bartley.</text>
            <text syncTime="3891.836" offset="15670732">I'll read the last full sentence on that page.</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.061" offset="15683584">“It is impossible to read from this record that the Board of Directors of Westinghouse were intimidated by force or fear.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3904.703" offset="15722141">And he goes on to the next page at 164, the same observation can be made with respect to the question concerning, “The apparent withholding of the NBC affiliation for Westinghouse's Pittsburgh station.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3919.358" offset="15780760">And finally at the bottom of the page, in the last two paragraphs, Commissioner Doerfer now, the Chairman says, “In the instant case there is no scintilla of evidence that NBC conspired with anyone to monopolize production of network or local programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3936.451" offset="15849200">No price fixing for advertises were remotely upturned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3940.834" offset="15866755">NBC exercise the superior bargaining position to exchange a smaller market station in Cleveland for a larger one in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.067" offset="15895594">No suggestion is made that NBC is attempting to keep other networks out of the Philadelphia market or any other market nor that it's conspired with anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.027" offset="15927463">Even Westinghouse is free to reenter the Philadelphia market with another network company or as an independent if it be so advised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3963.638" offset="15957974">No restraint of trade or attempt to monopolize and so on.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3966.817" offset="15970617">That is in reply to Mr. Justice Whittaker's question whether the Commission actually did pass on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3973.581" offset="15997680">Now, Your Honors --</text>

            <text syncTime="4007.272" offset="16132472">It's in suspense by virtue of the Government's argument that the facts were so simple quite contrary to the issues today that they could be stipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4015.516" offset="16165386">And I direct Your Honors' attention then to the critical provisions of the stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4022.760" offset="16194435">They are printed at Appendix B to our brief and they appear -- it appears at 139 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4030.125" offset="16223901">And I refer first to paragraph 7, the last sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4035.958" offset="16247202">Oh, let me just say to Your Honors in passing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4040.025" offset="16263502">This question of whether there was a hearing I'd like to get out of the way because it's covered by the stipulation and because Commissioner Doerfer covers it very fully in this hearing and he covers it almost in the language that Mr. Justice Frankfurter used in explaining the procedures of administrative commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4056.490" offset="16329331">Under the procedure, the Federal Communications Commission with all the facility that comes to an administrative body rather than a Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4065.529" offset="16365484">And I take that this is one of the reasons for the original establishment of administrative bodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4071.161" offset="16388054">It points out that the only time for a hearing is when something is to be accomplished by a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4076.908" offset="16411042">What happened here?</text>
            <text syncTime="4078.603" offset="16417834">The FCC instituted as extensive an investigation as I ever -- as I have ever known and incidentally those words are used in the stipulation, "extensive investigation."</text>
            <text syncTime="4091.373" offset="16468825">They sent investigators out to every single person who had anything to do with this, not just at NBC and not just at Westinghouse, but any other allegation, not without knowledge of the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4105.390" offset="16524936">They had everything the Department of Justice had because the transcript says that not -- I mean the stipulation -- that not only did the Department of Justice -- was the Department of Justice kept fully informed by the FCC but that they exchanged information.</text>
            <text syncTime="4124.127" offset="16599855">And so they went to the individuals in Philadelphia who allegedly were contacted by NBC to see whether NBC could acquire another station.</text>
            <text syncTime="4134.567" offset="16641651">They did a thorough complete workman-like job, the Broadcast Bureau of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4139.662" offset="16662026">And when they were all through, they decided that under Section 309 (b) of the Act, they could not proceed without a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4148.524" offset="16697448">That they required other information on certain issues, and they define the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="4151.759" offset="16710405">And I may say to Your Honor that among the issues defined were largely antitrust issues, largely the things that the Solicitor General talks about today.</text>
            <text syncTime="4162.636" offset="16753873">And both parties, both parties submitted very full and complete answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4169.466" offset="16781249">And again the Broadcast Bureau filed its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4173.738" offset="16798281">And then the broadcast bureau said, “Well now, in view of what we have now, there's nothing to be accomplished by you.</text>
            <text syncTime="4180.950" offset="16827120">There's no protesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="4181.984" offset="16831300">The Department of Justice has had plenty of notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4184.078" offset="16839659">It hasn't come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4185.033" offset="16843525">It hasn't done a thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4186.068" offset="16847600">It hasn't shown an interest in this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4187.981" offset="16855333">It hasn't indicated the things such a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4190.951" offset="16867140">Why have a hearing?"</text>
            <text syncTime="4192.478" offset="16873305">Commissioner Doerfer even said that he thought that what the Commission now had was more than it could get out of a proceeding where witnesses came on the stand and the restraints of being on a witness stand and subject to all of the rigors of a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4210.200" offset="16944149">And so with no complaint from anybody, and I may say with the concurrence even of the Broadcast Bureau which had thought there should be a hearing and acted as an adversary board, the Commission went ahead, and said that we don't need a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4222.615" offset="16993782">Now, if that isn't the purpose of administrative proceeding, I don't know what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4227.619" offset="17013844">No one has ever argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="4229.169" offset="17020008">That because of the false judgment doesn't involve a hearing, it's not res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="4233.609" offset="17037772">And here we don't even have to argue res judicata as I'll show in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4237.307" offset="17052609">But let me get back to the stipulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4241.545" offset="17069537">Paragraph 7 says behalf in the last sentence the FCC had before it all of the evidence relating to what?</text>
            <text syncTime="4251.949" offset="17111124">Relating to all of the antitrust issues presented by the complaint in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4258.321" offset="17136619">Now, there we have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4259.774" offset="17142471">No issue, antitrust in which they didn't have all the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4264.161" offset="17160025">No issue presented in the complaint as to which they didn't have all the evidence which the Department of Justice now has, paragraph 7 -- 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="4275.415" offset="17205060">In considering the proposed exchange, the FCC had a duty to and it did consider whether the evidence before it showed any violation of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="4286.411" offset="17249050">I want to talk more about that in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4289.081" offset="17259708">But it's shocking to me to have the Government say that in deciding the public interest, the Commission didn't have the plenary duty to decide whether this is a violation of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="4300.581" offset="17305684">And I may say just because Mr. Justice Harlan has shown interest in the case that I think hasn't much relation, the Mackay case cited by the Solicitor General because that was a -- a case of a common carrier regulated in a much different way (Voice Overlap) --</text>
