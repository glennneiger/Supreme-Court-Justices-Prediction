            <text syncTime="17.102" offset="171760">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.398" offset="192972">This matter before the Court today involves a suit that was filed by Southwestern Sugar-Molasses Company who is the petitioner in this matter against the River Terminals Corporation who is the respondent in this matter in the Eastern District of Louisiana at New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.943" offset="271130">Essentially, the suit alleged that Southwestern Sugar &amp; Molasses Company was the charterer of a molasses barge.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.938" offset="311150">And this particular molasses barge was towed with a cargo of molasses to Texas City, Texas where the barge sank and as a result, damage was sustained not only to the barge but the cargo was just about a complete lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.208" offset="408221">Libellant alleged a certain acts of negligence on behalf of River Terminals Corporation who towed this particular barge on the decent question.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.693" offset="446151">In one, that they failed to pump in sound -- sound the barge while it was en route that the barge lost tram en route and was taking on water and that they left the barge unattended, it appear in the Texas City knowing it to be in a dangerous and sinking condition without notifying libellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.797" offset="542595">The respondent in his answer alleged that it was not negligent that the barge was towed properly from the terminal at Reserve, Louisiana to Texas City, Louisiana that the barge was not left in a dangerous condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.565" offset="617618">And in addition to that, respondent further in his answer raised a defense in respect to its tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.741" offset="658369">River Terminals Corporation is certified by the Interstate Commerce Commission as a water carrier, and they did file a tariff with the Interstate Commerce Commission as to the rates and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.707" offset="726183">But in addition to that, that they filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, they also filed with the tariff the following, “When shipments are transported in barges furnished by owners, shippers, consignees or parties other than the carrier such barges and or cargos will be handled at owner's risk only whether or not -- whether the loss or damage is caused by negligence or otherwise.”</text>

            <text syncTime="201.096" offset="907786">And this provision is an exculpatory clause in respect to negligence on their part.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.922" offset="943104">The case was tried on the question of liability only before the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.841" offset="966719">And the District Judge, after hearing the case, entered an -- entered an interlocutory decree on behalf of the libellant holding River Terminals Corporation liable for the loss of the cargo as well as for the damage occasion to the barge.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.389" offset="1040906">And at the same time, the District Court held that this particular clause that was embodied in the tariff was against public policy and null and void in view of the Bisso decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.649" offset="1109974">From this interlocutory decree, the respondent appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.075" offset="1143724">The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals did not go into the merits of the case because they held that there was a defense that was urged by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.530" offset="1193462">And if this was a valid defense, we were out of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.582" offset="1205687">In other words, if this exculpatory clause was good whether or not there was negligence or not, they would be -- have to be -- it could not be held for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.629" offset="1269844">About or a very short time before this particular case came up before the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, there was another case that came before the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, the Mississippi Valley case.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.459" offset="1325223">And in that particular case, the identical exculpatory clause was in the tariff in that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.317" offset="1360645">And in that case, it was also raised -- raised as a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.264" offset="1380394">And in the Mississippi Valley case, the same Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held this exculpatory clause invalid and of no effect and cited the Bisso case decided by this Honorable Court as its authority for so holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.494" offset="1449357">In the Mississippi Valley case, writs were applied for -- to this Court and writs were denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.552" offset="1473599">And then afterwards, when this case -- the present case came up, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals said that if they had made an error in the Mississippi Valley case that it was their duty to rectify it, and they proceeded to reverse the decision of the lower -- reverse the decision of the lower court and remanded the case back to the lower court and afforded your petitioner here the opportunity to go before the Interstate Commerce Commission so that they could pay us on the validity of this clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.107" offset="1619780">And that was the effect of the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.706" offset="1630229">And from that, we applied for -- petitioner applied for writs which were granted by this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.404" offset="1665024">The difference between this particular case and the Bisso case is that in this particular case, River Terminals Corporation has filed its tariff, and it is certified by the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the Bisso case, which was decided by this Court, Bisso had filed no certificate or no tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.486" offset="1757288">He was merely a private tower but the -- otherwise, the case was the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.557" offset="1781635">In other words, it involved a barge that was damaged that was towed by Bisso.</text>

            <text syncTime="1258.878" offset="5138892">And that's what our position is, may it please Your Honor, that -- in other words, with the Bisso case and where it was decided as a matter of public policy, that if I turned my barge over to someone, they just can't haphazardly take that barge and let it sink or damage it or say damage it on -- on purpose, they wouldn't be responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.345" offset="5228753">In other words, they are under a degree of care with something that belongs to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.669" offset="5250069">And is the Court now going to allow the same exact situation to exist merely by the subterfuge of taking the same provision and instead of making the person you're dealing would sign a contract to tow your barge, to turn around and put it in your tariff and accomplish the same thing that was accomplished prior to the Bisso Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.329" offset="5360724">Now, this Court thought enough of that proposition back at the time that writs were granted the Bisso case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.179" offset="5388100">Of course, at that time, different circuits held different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.963" offset="5407222">And in the Bisso case, this Court thought of -- that it was not a matter of public interest that they granted writs in the case and after hearing the case, held that that was against public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.935" offset="5459153">It's the same thing as if I go to a garage, and up on the garage they have a sign of, “Pay parking 25 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.824" offset="5490709">We are not responsible for any negligence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.613" offset="5497814">You leave your car there and they knock all the fenders off of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.039" offset="5507532">You come back, get your automobile and they'll say, “Well, we are sorry that your fenders are all banged up, but didn't you read our tariff up there, didn't you see our rate?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.431" offset="5549119">And if this thing starts about people contracting away their negligence or doing away with that negligence by tariffs, everyone is going to be irresponsible of other people's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.644" offset="5605961">In other words, it will be a pretty sad state of affairs if people that owned barges and want their barges moved, they have to have a move and the person who takes the barge, he doesn't care anything about looking after your barge or seeing if it's sinking or what's happening to it and he takes it off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.300" offset="5680567">It might be -- have sprung a leak and he leaves it tied up to a wall and -- and doesn't notify anyone that -- so it could be pumped out or saved or whatnot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.732" offset="5718288">What does he care?</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.602" offset="5721736">He has it in his tariff, he's not responsible for his negligence, so he can do any sort of flagrant act of negligence he wants and get away with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.693" offset="5754128">Now, it's our argument that we have the same proposition here as we had in the Bisso case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.159" offset="5784012">It's just a different rankle to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.857" offset="5790804">In other words, it's approaching -- the tower is approaching it from a different position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.543" offset="5809507">They didn't like the Bisso case and want to get around the Bisso Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.478" offset="5825285">So when the Bisso case went against them, what did they do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.078" offset="5835734">They turned around and instead of having the same carriers who were operating under the I.C.C., the Interstate Commerce Commission, they used to rely upon that contract with the tower, the same particular people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.085" offset="5903757">But what did they do when your contract was held invalid?</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.441" offset="5917132">The same identical people, the towers, they turned around after this Court held it invalid to put it in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.222" offset="5940224">And they did away with the contract as illegal, and they turned that around to stick it in their tariff, the same identical people who are towing other people's barges who had contracted away their liability accomplishing exactly the same thing this Court tried to stop by just merely turning around and putting that particular provision; the exculpatory clause in the tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.794" offset="6038549">So -- insofar as the public policy is concerned, and it being against public policy, this Court -- I mean, it's -- it's the same thing right now before the Court as it was in the other instance because the same thing -- as -- as a practical matter, the same thing is happening, it was happening before.</text>

            <text syncTime="3301.501" offset="13309367">Well, Mr. Justice Whittaker, I -- I answer that -- I question this why.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.749" offset="13322324">The Bisso case did not involve a certificated carrier.The basis of the Bisso case, as I interpret it, well, as Mr. Justice Black who decided the Bisso case said that if you permit a -- an unregulated tower to require a shipper to release you from liability of the condition precedent for towing his barge will give rise to monopolistic practices because they all do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.810" offset="13430575">The bill of -- the rationale of the Bisso case, as I understand it, was principally the possibility of this monopolistic practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.279" offset="13464534">You don't have it under the Interstate Commerce Act, unless the Interstate Commerce Commission can require a carrier to put in a series of rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.315" offset="13512600">And most of the carrier were having the series of rates able to put on A, B and C rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.739" offset="13530363">A, B rate is a legal liability rate, an A rate is a rate under which the water carrier waives the Harter Act, acts of God and everything else to get on -- and makes the liability the same or even stronger than the real carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.543" offset="13585533">And a C rate -- and a C rate is a rate applicable only to a shipper's barge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.162" offset="13607999">Now, those C rates stand in the special category.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.014" offset="13631404">The C rate was put in, if you pardon me, through necessity, regarding the matter for the ship -- for the Interstate Commerce Commission for putting those matters of necessity because under Part III of the Interstate Commerce Act, a shipper is permitted to furnish the barge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.846" offset="13698800">Carriers don't want them, they got their own barges.</text>
