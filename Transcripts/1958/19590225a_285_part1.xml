            <text syncTime="20.844" offset="186702">Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.703" offset="202167">This is an admiralty case which presents two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.686" offset="230066">The first of these which I'll State quite generally for the moment involves the question whether the courts below improperly delimited or restricted the controversy which was tendered for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.974" offset="303313">The second question which is quite distinct is whether the District Court, having rendered judgment for the respondent, the Isthmian Steamship Company, made an award of the interest, compound interest which exceeds the statutory limit imposed by these suits in Admiralty Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.037" offset="411564">The libel in this case was filed by the Isthmian Steamship Company against United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.512" offset="441448">And the pleadings disclosed that there are two commercial transactions involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.443" offset="469138">I need not go into any of the detail of those transactions merely it is, however, necessary to state their substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.420" offset="513024">First, in 1946, the United States, through its agency, the War Shipping Administration, leased or chartered eight government-owned vessels to Isthmian.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.233" offset="588257">The amount of the charter hire was to be determined on a sliding scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.983" offset="611349">It was made dependent upon the amount of net voyage profits that were realized from the operation of the ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.550" offset="653563">A disagreement led ultimately to dispute, and the United States claimed Isthmian not acquiescing.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.569" offset="689612">The Isthmian owed some $115,000 in charter hire beyond what it had paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.695" offset="730154">Now, the second transaction, in 1953, an Isthmian vessel known as the Steelworker, which is not one of the vessels involved in the charter parties, carried a large quantity of military freight for the Government and in due course, submitted a freight bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.783" offset="830464">That bill was for $116,000 using round figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.865" offset="858781">At this point, the United States paid Isthmian roughly $1000 in cash and advised Isthmian that it was applying the balance of the amount due on the affreightment in satisfaction of the Government's preexisting claim against Isthmian for additional charter hire.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.157" offset="964002">Isthmian thereupon went to court initially as it happens to the wrong court.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.589" offset="989706">It filed suit in the Court of Claims alleging all of the facts, which I've just outlined.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.541" offset="1025546">It asserted in the Court of Claims complaint that the Government's claim for additional charter hire was groundless and that the Government was withholding money which was due to Isthmian.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.754" offset="1086360">Now, the Court of Claims dismissed that complaint on the Government's motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.266" offset="1104436">The Government argued, we think correctly in its motion, that whether one view the subject of the litigation as being Isthmian's claim for maritime freight or a claim that the Government was improperly withholding money because it -- charter hire claim was groundless.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.541" offset="1201507">In either event, it was a maritime transaction and within the exclusive jurisdiction of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.976" offset="1227316">And the Court of Claims agreed and Isthmian thereupon when into the District Court, filed a libel there but followed a different tactic at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.301" offset="1272560">Wherein its libel, it makes no reference whatever to the Government's claim for additional charter hire.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.739" offset="1306311">Isthmian's libel as the Court will note in the record merely pleads that it had performed within the limitations period certain freight services that it submitted a bill for $416,000 and that it received only $1000.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.271" offset="1388440">Now, the Government's answer to that libel unqualifiedly admitted the correctness of Isthmian's freight bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.718" offset="1430235">The Government then pleaded that it had applied the balance, that is the $115,000, in satisfaction of a claim which the United States asserted against Isthmian, and the answer then proceeded to set forth the facts upon which that additional claim for charter hire is based.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.769" offset="1522500">In addition to filing this -- in addition to making this affirmative defense, the Government also filed a cross-libel in which it repeated its claim for additional charter hire.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.281" offset="1600449">Now, Isthmian's response to the Government's position in the pleading was two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.493" offset="1637334">First, it said that the Government's defense that it had withheld the amount due on the freight bill and applied it to the Government's preexisting claim could not be regarded as a plea in the nature of payment or satisfaction, could not be regarded as an affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.656" offset="1721971">It said it must be regarded as a counterclaim.Secondly, it argued if you regard it as a counterclaim, then it is not in our -- in Isthmian's view, cognizable in admiralty because Isthmian argues admiralty can only recognize counterclaims which arise out of the same transaction which is the basis of the libel.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.040" offset="1819564">Both courts below accepted that position and concluded on that basis that a judgment pro confesso should be entered for Isthmian and that the United States then should institute a second suit to determine if it is entitled to get back with the right hand what it has just been ordered to pay over was left.</text>

            <text syncTime="462.497" offset="1953311">It said once it struck out the affirmative defense, there was no common issue and that it was then independent counterclaim and that admiralty could not hear an independent counterclaim.</text>

            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="473.719" offset="1998242">The thought of the interest is to overrule a motion to consolidate (Inaudible) in fact strike out the cross-libel.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer</label>
            <text syncTime="484.276" offset="2040456">Well, he first ruled, as I recall it, that this was not a matter of affirmative defense and he struck that from the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.022" offset="2075460">Then he said at this point the libel and the cross-libel no longer have a common issue and therefore cannot be heard and the Government has relegated to bringing it back in lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.953" offset="2139199">I should add one further word about the proceedings below.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.817" offset="2158634">The Court of Appeals opinion here is really the opinion in the Grace Line's case and not in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.307" offset="2192593">We reprinted the Grace Line's opinion as an appendix to our petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.030" offset="2211506">The Grace Line's case involved the same issue as this but involved additional issues, and we did not petition in the Grace Line case because of the fact that there were these additional complicating factors in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="582.425" offset="2433024">And the question which this case presents is whether the result is required in admiralty.</text>

            <text syncTime="620.662" offset="2585997">I think that's what the Court of Appeals was saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.934" offset="2595088">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.128" offset="2603865">Now, our first line of argument doesn't involve a consideration of the Admiralty Rules at all because the argument is this, that the United States has a right which is founded on statute and finds support in decisions of the Court over many decades, its substantive right to withhold and apply when it is both debtor and creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.817" offset="2718595">At that so, if there is such a power in the United States, then the courts are, of course, open to determine whether the United States had a valid claim, open to determine whether the United States had a proper basis for making this administrative setoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.845" offset="2826742">We say however if there is this right to withhold and apply when the United States is both debtor and creditor, one doesn't reach any question under the Admiralty Rules because our defense then is that we've made satisfaction we paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.639" offset="2885883">It is a plea in the nature of satisfaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.601" offset="2897795">And we say in that situation, the -- the controversy, the real controversy as the Court to put it in the somewhat similar New Haven case last term, the real controversy is whether the claim to -- upon which the Government is resting when it says we're applying what we owe you in satisfaction of what you owe us, whether that claim of the Government is a valid one.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.221" offset="3020257">Now, basically, the -- the position of the respondent which we have to meet its basic objection to this line of argument, I think, is summed up by what is said at page 23 of the respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.976" offset="3091310">And they quote Williston for the proposition that mutual debts do not extinguish one another either automatically or by manifestation of election of one party either agreement of the parties or judicial action is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.495" offset="3169364">And then they go on to say that lapse of time may borrow recovery on one-forth debt and leave the other still enforceable.Now, acknowledging that this may be the general rule, and we don't think it would add exception, we don't think it touches the question whether the United States has a statutory right to make it administrative setoff without agreement of the other party when it is both debtor and creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.096" offset="3303737">Now, such a right is not unknown, we think, to private party relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.041" offset="3327561">A primary example of it in the common law is what is often times referred to as the banker's right of setoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.622" offset="3361834">I think it's settled in almost every jurisdiction in this country perhaps in all that if a bank holds my note and I'm delinquent on it or to demand note, and I have a deposit with the bank that the bank may apply that deposit in satisfaction of my obligation on the note.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.101" offset="3471757">If I think that the bank has made a mistake and that I'm not obligated on my note and I sue to get my deposit from the bank, the bank has a good defense if it can show that it in fact had a valid enforceable claim against me based on the note.</text>

            <text syncTime="1113.982" offset="4559287">More recently in the Munsey Trust case, the Court used the language that when the Government acts under this Code Section, it strikes a balance between the debts and credits of the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1145.803" offset="4686555">Well, normally, the complaining party filed a complaint if he doesn't acquiesce that the Government has a basis for withholding in which he alleges that the Government's claim, the claim upon the basis of which it made the deductions is invalid and that issue gets determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.054" offset="4767640">That, for example, was the situation in the Alcoa Steamship case which we cite in our brief, a case which was before the Second Circuit and later came here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1205.744" offset="4926360">And Judge Learned Hand in the Court of Appeals said in that case that the question in the case, I think one may interpolate only, the only question in the case was whether the United States overpaid when it paid the first bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.465" offset="5001279">Now, we're, of course, not questioning that the Government made itself liable under the suits in Admiralty Act or amenable to the ordinary admiralty practice.</text>
