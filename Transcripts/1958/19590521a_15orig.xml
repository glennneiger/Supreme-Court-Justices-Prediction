            <text syncTime="453.890" offset="1918934">The army engineers' estimates which were put into the House Committee record on the hearings on House Bill 1 which had been pending before the Congress to authorize an experimental diversion of the thing 1000 cubic meters in Chicago.</text>

            <text syncTime="1054.269" offset="4320423">About -- just about two years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.637" offset="4329932">And at that time, the street communities organized as they were authorized to do under Illinois local law -- statutory law, the commission which we have referred to here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.088" offset="4383744">Just to give you a little further orientation on the matter geographically Elmhurst is the nearest of these communities to Lake Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.382" offset="4416867">It's approximately 16 miles inland to the west of the City of Chicago.</text>

            <text syncTime="1092.887" offset="4474964">Of these were the three communities which organized the commission, which was setup pursuant to Illinois statutory law to construct the system for a common supply of water and to construct the necessary water mains leading from the source of water to the municipalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.696" offset="4546121">The commission had authority to finance construction of its system to the sale of revenue bonds payable from revenues derived by the commission under its water contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.617" offset="4589798">The commission took a number of steps in the latter part of 1957 and throughout the year 1958.</text>

            <text syncTime="1136.310" offset="4648626">The commission contracted for the purchase of a site on the shore of Lake Michigan within the village of Glen Cove for a water intake and pumping station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.114" offset="4687809">It contracted for the purchase of a site a little further inland for a filtration plan and contracted also for an easement for its water mains most of which would run along the right of way of the Chicago and northwestern railroad all within Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.193" offset="4752175">The transmission mains were to be approximately 14 miles in length and would be required to carry the roll water from Lake Michigan at the intake point in Glen Cove through the commission's proposed filtration plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.434" offset="4805151">The treated water was then to have been transmitted by the commission to the municipal boundaries of its customers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1615.619" offset="6565804">The approach which this Court has been taking on problems of allocation of water has been that of what is known as the doctrine of equitable apportionment which has been applied by this Court in proceedings involving states whether those states are western states following internally the doctrine of prior appropriation or whether those states are middle western and eastern states which generally follow the doctrine of riparian rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.945" offset="6671130">In either case, without regard to what type of state you may be dealing with so far as local internal water rights determination are concern, this Court has approached the problem as being one of equitable apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.641" offset="6729958">The Solicitor General in his brief amicus filed here has been in agreement that that has been the approach of this Court and the decisions clearly show the point the two most important ones that this Court knows being Connecticut against Massachusetts having to do with the diversion of the waters of the swift Delaware into the Boston area and New Jersey against New York having to do with the diversion of Delaware waters into the Hudson River watershed for New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.049" offset="6835597">The cases that have come before this Court under the doctrine of equitable apportionment have in some case has been hard cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.185" offset="6860152">And New Jersey against New York with such a case, there was great need on the New York side and yet there also was a prospect of substantial and serious harm downstream to the sovereign states of the rights of the sovereign States of Pennsylvania and New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.102" offset="6923786">And the result was that this Court's decree in that case was protective of those downstream rights by imposing certain restrictions upon New York in a way of requiring certain measures to be taken for the maintenance of flow and low water periods and the like so as to minimize the harm downstream, balance that with the benefits to be achieved by the taking by New York thereby achieving a true division in accordance with equitable apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.679" offset="7050115">That's the type of hard case we say which this Court has had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.394" offset="7072998">This case we think is no such hard case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.187" offset="7084074">Primarily, because the doctrine of equitable apportionment really doesn't have to be brought into play unless you've prove damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.799" offset="7110614">It's when you have damages on the one side that you have to line up that disadvantages the harm on that side as against the benefits on the other and having line those up, then the Court has to reach its conclusions as to where it thinks the equitable apportionment of the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.655" offset="7178010">But here, there is no damage this taking of 25 to 30 cubic feet per second from the lake producing an imperceptible effect on the lake is going to produce no damage of any kind to the other Great Lakes States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.567" offset="7237674">And consequently, we maintain that the doctrine of equitable apportionment really has no place here, because there isn't anything which you have to line up in the way of detriment to the other states against these benefits and this urgent need of our communities for this water which we're proposing to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.489" offset="7313324">But even if you did consider that the doctrine was -- was to be applicable, it is clear and you have established in Connecticut against Massachusetts that the taking of water for the purposes for which we are proposing to take it is the highest possible use to which water can be devoted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3216.991" offset="12971342">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.445" offset="13001122">Complainant has quoted in its brief the words of Justice Holmes, “A river is more than an amenity, it is a treasure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.454" offset="13037171">It offers a necessity of life that must be rationed among those who have power over it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.977" offset="13079280">We believe the words of the justice might properly be paraphrased for application to our present problem as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.818" offset="13122644">The Great Lakes are more than an amenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.239" offset="13144377">They are a national, yes, even an international treasure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.820" offset="13170604">They offer a necessity of life that must be conserved among those who have power over them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.823" offset="13210624">We propose to show that the actions of Michigan throughout and its position today is not one of adamant denial to another state of the use of this great resource, but rather there any use shall be reasonable and in keeping with the utmost possible preservation of the resource for co-users whether they'd be sister states or a friendly foreign power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.519" offset="13349491">To this and may I review briefly the history of this present controversy?</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.466" offset="13381256">On December 19th, 1957, Governor Williams of Michigan wrote Governor Stratton of Illinois expressing his concern and seeking information over what appeared to be a new diversion of water from the Great Lakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.286" offset="13468505">His letter enclosed a copy of a letter of the Attorney General of a State of Michigan expressing the opinion that the contemplated diversion would be a violation of the decree of the Supreme Court dated April 21, 1930.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.591" offset="13545723">No reply was ever received to this letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.580" offset="13565680">Again, on March 11, Governor Williams wrote Governor Stratton to reiterate his concern over any diversion from the Great Lakes basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.908" offset="13618970">No reply was received to this letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.990" offset="13639346">On October the 9th, 1958, the Governor of the Sovereign State of Michigan, having twice failed to receive a response of the Governor of Illinois, an information having come to me of the organization of a water commission that proposed to serve the domestic and industrial needs of three inland, non-riparian villages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.736" offset="13782288">I did write the letter a copy of which is a pendant to complainant's motion for a leave to file a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.306" offset="13820635">Again, on behalf of the State of Michigan, I objected to the apparent attempt not to use but to divert the waters of the Great Lakes from the Great Lakes basin to the Mississippi watershed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.589" offset="13901720">Now, may I say that in attempting to deal with this controversy, the State of Michigan has found itself faced with an enigma or perhaps I should say, with a case of schizophrenia for we have attempted to deal with the State of Illinois and we found ourselves ignored, forced to turn our attention to the Water Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.429" offset="14029093">And if we attempted to deal with the Water Commission, then we found ourselves sued by the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.714" offset="14074232">We the defendants feel that we are faced with alternative situations, each of which presents its own legal problems and issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.032" offset="14127522">If we are dealing with a suit brought in reality by the Water Commission, then the issues as we view then becomes as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.821" offset="14174647">The State of Illinois is not the real party and interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.826" offset="14194709">The complainant -- the complaint does not present a justiciable controversy between states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.411" offset="14216965">No actual controversy or case exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.036" offset="14235564">Developed complaint shows neither juridical right nor injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.403" offset="14260955">The Federal Declaratory Act is not applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.170" offset="14280077">Well a co-counsel for Wisconsin, New York and Pennsylvania will address their attention to these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.639" offset="14313932">If we are dealing with a suit brought in truth by the State of Illinois, then we believe the following issues become pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.737" offset="14366281">Before entertaining jurisdiction of this Court as a precondition require that a good faith effort be made by the States themselves to settle their dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.150" offset="14432005">Require that the complainant's state make a clearer prima facie showing that the relief it seeks is truly to meet a present crisis in domestic usage.</text>

            <text syncTime="3595.871" offset="14486862">Mr. Banes, I understood him to say that there were efforts made and they approved the subordinates were unsuccessfully.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul L. Adams</label>
            <text syncTime="3604.484" offset="14521344">I would like to review those if I may, Mr. Justice Frankfurter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.101" offset="14559796">Second point that the complainant state make a clearer prima facie showing that the relief it seeks is truly to meet a present crisis and domestic usage not for industrial development or future domestic needs or in lieu of some other, well perhaps more expensive method of providing water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.709" offset="14670242">Secondly, that if the Court does entertain jurisdiction, then it should take cognizance of the whole controversy between the respective parties as it fits a suit between quasi sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.827" offset="14730637">And thirdly, that if this Court takes jurisdiction, it should direct its attention and concern to the preservation of the Great Lakes basin rather than to a division or apportionment of this great national and international treasure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.433" offset="14841083">One, before entertaining jurisdiction, the Court should require that a good faith effort be made by the States themselves to settle their dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.722" offset="14890297">On March the 6th, 1959, I suggested a conference to discuss problems of diversion at the suggestion of a Solicitor General of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.775" offset="14950484">On March 16th, 1959, the then Attorney General of Illinois, Attorney General Castle, replied to me that, and I quote, “Illinois is entitled to take the domestic pumpage from the lakes without returning any part thereof to Lake Michigan.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.277" offset="15048495">And that this was the position of the State of Illinois that well is perfectly willing to confer this was the position that the State would maintain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.825" offset="15098650">I realized that the complainant claims good faith that I submit that this type of position or to cite another example that an offer to negotiate on the basis that the only negotiation would be the withdrawal of the objections of the complainant states is not good faith negotiation or an attempt between the States to settle these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.952" offset="15235218">And I submit to the Court that under the contract clause or the Federal Constitution, under principles of international law, full disclosure, negotiation, inquiry, mediation, conciliation and other peaceful means are the course that should be adopted first before the jurisdiction of this high tribunal is invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.864" offset="15370846">The Court should cause the complainant to make a clearer prima facie showing that the relief it seeks is to meet a present crisis in domestic usage, not for industrial development or future domestic needs or in lieu of some other perhaps more expensive method of providing water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3842.839" offset="15474709">This Water Commission proposes to serve, and this is from their own motion, the City of Elmhurst, the villages of Villa Park, Lombard, Addison, Bensenville, Elk Grove and industrial users, pages 9 and 10 of the complainant's motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3870.656" offset="15585991">I submit to the Court that the affidavit of Ralph A. Smith will not stand careful analysis and scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="3880.050" offset="15623607">He states, “During recent years, the increasing consumption of water in domestic and industrial users is beginning to exceed the water supply available through underground sources.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3898.956" offset="15699153">Page 5, motion to advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3903.135" offset="15715871">And Joseph F. Collin, the other affiant, uses the same identical language in the body of his affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3914.395" offset="15760906">And both of these men say and summing out and I'm trying to justify this action the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.509" offset="15793403">Due to the increase need for water, they do not say, “Water for what?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3929.657" offset="15822033">They merely say, “Due to the increase need for water.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3934.267" offset="15840423">A real danger exists that the well supplies may diminish within the next few years to the point where a serious shortage will exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3951.284" offset="15908551">I submit that these affidavits do not provide a proper foundation for action by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3958.477" offset="15937285">Know well that their faced assertion of the complainant that there is no other source of water supply in the area except Lake Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3970.077" offset="15983679">But this plains and parks rivers cannot be explained the way by saying, and again I quote, “They do not have sufficient flow or wholesomeness of quality of water to serve these communities.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3992.060" offset="16071659">On the second point, if the Court does take jurisdiction, it should take cognizance of the whole controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4000.652" offset="16105932">We agree with the Solicitor General, that a State has a real interest, quasi sovereign in character in all the earth, water and air within its domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="4014.367" offset="16160789">And if the present suit were bought to determine all the relative rights of the State of Illinois in the waters of Lake Michigan, we would take no exception to the Solicitor General's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4030.358" offset="16224841">In a suit between quasi sovereigns, all rights should be adjudicated in a single or in consolidated action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4040.587" offset="16265697">We agreed that this controversy might well be likened to a boundary dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4047.438" offset="16293073">But we insist, look at the whole boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4053.446" offset="16317106">Do not attempt to settle the dispute an inch at a time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4060.486" offset="16345318">And as a final point which admittedly goes to the merits of the controversy but which is discussed in the Solicitor General's brief in terms of equitable apportionment, we contend that the prime -- that the prime concern of the Court and of all the lakes states should be the preservation not the division of the waters of the Great Lakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4087.058" offset="16451584">We contend that is not possible for this Court equitably or in any other way to apportion the waters of the Great Lakes as between Illinois and Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="4099.750" offset="16502366">We contend that the right of navigation is a paramount national right that would be affected if Illinois is permitted to divert unilaterally even 30 CFS.</text>
            <text syncTime="4113.787" offset="16558477">This is a measurable diversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4117.395" offset="16573001">It amounts to three one hundredths of an inch.</text>
            <text syncTime="4121.703" offset="16590137">This is in terms of the need of only 90,000 people.3</text>
            <text syncTime="4127.555" offset="16613543">3 and one-third times, three one hundredths of an inch equals one inch.</text>
            <text syncTime="4135.522" offset="16645413">One inch equals 1,500,000 tons of shipping annually.</text>
            <text syncTime="4144.799" offset="16682611">Certainly, the needs and use of an early 40,000,000 people in the Great Lakes area demand the most careful preservation of this national resource.</text>
            <text syncTime="4157.639" offset="16733915">It is not enough to assert that some solution to the overall problem will be found by impounding excess water during wet years when the lake cycle is high.</text>
            <text syncTime="4171.390" offset="16788982">And thereby, provide additional water during drought years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4177.031" offset="16811447">Such a solution is being and has in the past been sought by the U.S. Corps of Engineers but it has not yet been achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4188.714" offset="16858258">In the meantime, the only proper and sensible rule is once of reasonable use of as little diminution as possible of return to the -- to this treasure, to this common pool of that which is taken from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4210.822" offset="16946657">This has been the policy of all the lake states except Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="4217.671" offset="16974033">If this Court sanctions taking by unilateral action, the result can be either endless litigation on a peace meal basis or constant repeated injury to the Great Lakes States, to the paramount navigational interest of the United States and to the rights of Canada.</text>

            <text syncTime="4796.029" offset="19287437">I would like just to bring the Court back to review the complaint at this stage of the proceeding of course we're considering whether Illinois shall be given leave to sue the rest of us on the basis of the complaint, to this is -- before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4815.790" offset="19366536">It's our position, it's my position at least that I'm sure it's the position of the rest of my colleagues that the complaint does not invoke the parens patriae doctrine in -- in the present writing of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="4831.739" offset="19430379">If this lawsuit is either a class action or a private lawsuit which has never been within the -- never been taken within the jurisdiction of this type of action between sovereign states.</text>
            <text syncTime="4850.545" offset="19505507">To look at the complaint itself, it -- it -- the factual obligations involved the water needs of 90,000 people, the formation of a commission, the commission being a public corporation going into the business of hiring engineers of engaging in contracts for the acquisition of its rights of way for its properties and entering into contracts for the sale of its water and for the contracts of the sale of it bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4891.199" offset="19668198">Threats the allegation say by the Attorney General, however made the delivery of the bonds impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="4901.952" offset="19711143">We contend it's my position at any rate that that is the principle grievance of this particular complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="4909.160" offset="19739982">The -- the failure of the inability of Illinois of the commission to sell its bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4924.358" offset="19800795">The remaining allegations of the complaint make it clear that this is an action primarily for the commission for the sole benefit of this public corporation and not for the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="4939.671" offset="19862026">I refer for instance to the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="4944.807" offset="19882611">In paragraph 12, the complaint reads, “The commission here involved there's only the power to acquire a supply of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="4955.251" offset="19924407">It has no function or power to dispose of the sewage effluent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4960.219" offset="19944260">Only parts of the communities to be observed by the commission are within the Metropolitan Sanitary District of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="4967.817" offset="19974666">But like that district, they all dispose of their sewage effluent into the Mississippi watershed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4975.578" offset="20005700">Then the complaint goes on further to say in paragraph 13 on page 13, the question of return of sewage effluent by that area is involved in the other proceedings in -- in original actions two, three and four for which are the most impending before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5000.195" offset="20104129">The right of the commission, the complaint states to withdraw water from the lake for domestic purposes as proposed by it should be declared without consideration of any demand by the defendants that the sewage effluent resulting from -- therefrom, that is from their own water it's directions should be returned to the lakes.</text>
