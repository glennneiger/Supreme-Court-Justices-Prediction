            <label>Mr. Telford Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="12.102" offset="151803">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.331" offset="164655">This case is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals of the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.516" offset="185448">It's an appeal from a conviction under what is known as the membership clause of the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.966" offset="207287">The case has been here before.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.632" offset="217945">It came here in the 1956 term, after the petitioner had been tried at his first trial and convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.042" offset="255561">And, at that time, the constitutional and statutory questions were argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.974" offset="275310">The -- the Court set the case for re-argument at the beginning of the 1957 term.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.085" offset="299760">But before it was reached, the Jencks case, having come down in the mean time, the Solicitor General confessed error under the Jencks case and this Court reversed in a short per curiam opinion on the authority of Jencks, leaving those constitutional and statutory issues untouched that we had argued before.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.361" offset="392861">The case was, of course, remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.060" offset="403623">The petitioner has now been tried a second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.101" offset="415744">He has been convicted again.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.079" offset="423685">The Court of Appeals has again affirmed and the case is again here on certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.002" offset="455346">The principal issues that were argued when the case was here before are here again in substantially the same form.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.278" offset="488469">There are also some important new issues which arise chiefly out of the evidence and the evidentiary rulings at the second trial and out of the intervening decisions of this Court, especially in the Yates case.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.240" offset="544371">And I will come to some of those new questions presently.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.806" offset="562552">But, I would like, first, if I may, to call the Court's attention to the statute which is most closely involved here, the membership clause, which appears in the appendix to our brief, page 2A, because the wording of that clause and its setting in the Smith Act as a whole is rather critical importance to almost all the issues that we have to deal with this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.316" offset="660668">Court will recall, within the Smith Act, paragraphs (1) and (3) deal with advocacy and organizing.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.363" offset="692851">And, most of the Smith Act prosecutions, so far, have been for conspiracy to violate those two paragraphs.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.574" offset="721690">Those are the ones that were involved in the Dennis case, and the Yates case, and the Mesarosh case, and the other Smith Act cases that have been here before.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.164" offset="760038">Then, in paragraph (3), there's a second clause which describes “whoever becomes or is a member of or affiliates with any such society group or assembly of persons knowing the purposes thereof and that such society refers back to a group which teaches or advocates the overthrow of the Government by force and violence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="188.939" offset="859094">Now, this case and a few others, pending in the lower federal courts, have been brought under that clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.112" offset="887829">One of them, for example, was up here as a companion case two years ago, the Lightfoot case, and reversed on the same ground under the Jencks rule, remanded to the Court of Appeals in Chicago, and is pending there.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.692" offset="934118">And has been stayed pending the outcome of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.393" offset="952926">Another one is the Noto case from the Second Circuit which is pending here on petition for certiorari now.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="218.121" stopTime="221.072">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="218.121" offset="975809">Were those cases had been tried?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="telford_taylor" startTime="221.072" stopTime="646.388">
            <label>Mr. Telford Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="221.072" offset="987617">The Lightfoot case has not been tried again.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.038" offset="995558">It was stayed pending the outcome of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.562" offset="1009664">The Noto case, Justice Harlan, was tried before this case came up originally has been pending in the Second Circuit a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.907" offset="1039026">There are several others that we have listed in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.005" offset="1055431">If I may now state without, at this point, developing the two major issues that were here before and that are here again, the first is the constitutionality of the membership clause on its face under the First and Fifth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.003" offset="1111333">That clause was not involved in the Dennis and Yates cases and, therefore, it has not yet been passed on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.332" offset="1136724">And, secondly, the effect on the membership clause, if any, of Section 4 (f) of the Internal Security Act of 1950, enacted 10 years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.399" offset="1188968">That's set forth in the appendix to our brief, pages 3A to 4A, and that says that neither holding office nor membership in any Communist organization shall per se constitute a violation of any criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.237" offset="1244348">Now, that clause, we contend, was intended to be and it is a bar to prosecutions of Communists under the membership clause and, therefore, the indictment fails to state a cause of action, state -- state an offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.649" offset="1297951">The new questions I will come to presently, but let me say now that since this Court has for two days been hearing argument revolving around the Jencks case and 18 U.S.C. 3500.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.414" offset="1349047">This case -- the second trial in this case was after both the Jencks decision, of course, and the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.376" offset="1376841">And, the trial judge followed the procedures set forth in, I think it's paragraph (c) of the Jencks statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.428" offset="1409128">That is to say, he examined, in Camara, reports made to the FBI by witnesses of the Government and excised portions that he deemed irrelevant, so that the constitutionality of that feature of 3500 is raised here.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.213" offset="1480182">Most of the other questions that the Court has been concerned with the last two days are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.086" offset="1499721">Now, a word about the facts and the course of proceedings are heretofore in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.361" offset="1520828">The indictment is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.837" offset="1530755">The indictment is to be found on page A2 of the record, first page of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.306" offset="1552593">The Court will see, it was very short and simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.433" offset="1565132">The charge is that the Communist Party is a group that advocates violent overthrow and has done so since January 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.935" offset="1599091">The charge is that the defendant, Scales, was a member of the Communist Party and, I may say, that that -- the fact that he was then a member at the time of his indictment is not denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.537" offset="1645484">It's charged that the defendant had knowledge that the Party was a group which advocated force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.224" offset="1672234">And, finally, it is charged that the defendant personally intended to bring about governmental overthrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.978" offset="1695326">That last charge lies outside the specific language of the statute because the clause does not, in so many words at least, comprehend intent, as well as knowledge, as an element.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.040" offset="1747571">Now, the petitioner was convicted at his first trial and sentenced to six years imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.597" offset="1777768">The Court of appeals affirmed and it was reversed here, as I've already stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.198" offset="1792188">The second trial was in February of 1958, a little more than a year ago, found guilty, sentenced again to six years and I may say that, so far as I know, this is the only sentence under the Smith Act which exceeds five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.783" offset="1850493">There, of course, has been a five-year-ceiling on conspiracy convictions until recently and I know of no other case that is -- that has governed this sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.821" offset="1886647">The evidence -- the evidence in the Government's case is summarized in the briefs and, at some length, in the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.135" offset="1919875">I think, at this point, it is enough to say that the Government's evidence fell under two general categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.250" offset="1944325">There was, to begin with, evidence about the doctrinal teachings of the Communist Party which was presented, for the most part, through witnesses who did not know the defendant had never seen him and gave no testimony touching the defendant personally, but who told about what had been said at Communist meetings in various parts of the country, largely, statements made by teachers at so-called Communist schools largely in the 1930s and 1940s.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.179" offset="2060100">Then, the balance of the Government's case was largely the evidence of persons who had joined the Communist Party as informants for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in North Carolina and who had known the defendant there and testified about his activities and his statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.365" offset="2132825">There were some overlap but, generally speaking, that was the scope and nature of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.895" offset="2154977">This evidence about the Communist Party as to whether it engages in the proscribed advocacy, that is one of the things which raises important new questions or at least were not here in this form on the previous occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.223" offset="2220283">For example, in the Yates case, it was held that, on the basis of the record made in that case in Los Angeles, there was not enough to conclude that the Communist Party advocates force and violence in the sense of the called action.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.558" offset="2281618">That it -- and that it did not engage in action in citing advocacy on the basis of the record made there.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.282" offset="2304502">Well, the question arises, was there anything in this trial in Greensboro to justify coming to a different conclusion about the Communist Party on the record made in Greensboro, as compared to the record made in Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.520" offset="2357478">Then, another important question arising out of that evidence, we contend and I will in a moment develop, that some of the new evidence offered by the Government in an effort to meet the criteria laid down in the Yates case resulted in an unconstitutional application of the statute in this case, so that even if we were to assume that the statute is not void on its face that it had been unconstitutionally applied here because of evidence offered and rulings made thereon.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.115" offset="2479835">There are other questions in the case which I will mention, if time permits at end, but I think that those I have described are the major problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.063" offset="2519646">Now, it will be apparent to the Court from what I've said so far that there are issues here which, if our position is sound, would warrant reversal without touching the constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.422" offset="2581086">At the same time, it is equally clear that the conviction cannot be affirmed unless the validity on its face of the membership clause is upheld, so that the constitutionality of that clause it's -- is at the core of the Government's case and is basic to the case as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.330" offset="2648691">And, I would like to begin with the constitutionality of the clause, then pass to its constitutionality as applied here, and then discuss the effect of Section 4 (f) of the Internal Security Act.</text>

            <label>Mr. Telford Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="687.698" offset="2854118">With respect to the constitutionality of this clause, we have, in our brief, tried to give the Court the benefit of whatever historical background there is on this which may be pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.294" offset="2896541">It is an unusual statute in the sense that it attaches criminal consequences to association by membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.159" offset="2927992">There have been a few precedence but, as the Court will see from our brief, they are not many and I ask the Court to consider what this statute undertakes to imbue with criminal character.There is no charge that the defendant advocated violent overthrow or anything or that he incited anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.073" offset="2999672">There's no charge of organizing.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.330" offset="3008658">There is no charge of conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.124" offset="3019839">There is no act charged except for remaining a member of the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.741" offset="3038333">There is no concert of action or agreement with anyone else charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.886" offset="3054947">There is nothing but membership and the state of mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.919" offset="3071039">And, we suggest that the constitutional infirmities under the First Amendment are pretty plain on the face.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.176" offset="3092041">Whether we regard these as restrictions on free speech or on freedom of assembly might perhaps be debated.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.138" offset="3119940">In Whitney against California, Justice Brandeis, in his concurring opinion, seem to think that both of them were involved when he was analyzing a statute somewhat like this one, and he expressed very grave doubts on behalf of himself and Justice Holmes about the constitutionality of this kind of attributing criminality to association.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.695" offset="3206144">It is true that the majority opinion in that case leans the other way, but this Court has said in the Dennis case that the later decisions of this Court have followed the rationale of the Holmes-Brandeis opinion rather than the majority and, of course, that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.301" offset="3268524">The Holmes-Brandeis opinion develops, for example, the incitement versus advocacy distinction that was developed by this Court later in the Yates case.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.143" offset="3303946">Then, two, I think it's plain that the membership clause lacks the elements that this Court relied on in Dennis in sustaining the other provisions of the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.585" offset="3341667">There, we were dealing with defendants who were charged with conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.468" offset="3357236">They were the people who were supposed to attach this conspiracy in 1945 in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.897" offset="3382941">The danger of such a conspiracy was very much stressed in all of the majority opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.415" offset="3401017">That's not present here, but I think equally compelling are the arguments that have been made to sustain the constitutionality of the membership clause by the court below and by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.758" offset="3462353">The court below has dealt with this problem simply by saying that conspiracy is the same thing as membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.651" offset="3494013">I call the Court's attention to what it said there at my brief page 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.668" offset="3522017">The membership clause is, of course, nothing more or less than a statute denouncing and making criminal a conspiracy to overthrow the Government by force or violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.704" offset="3558170">Well, with all respect to the learned judge who wrote that, it seems to me utterly untenable.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.197" offset="3580113">To begin with, the Smith Act does not punish a conspiracy to overthrow the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.157" offset="3604041">That's accomplished by statutes that have been on the books a long time, since the War Between the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.977" offset="3623267">This is a statute touching advocacy and that is why the First Amendment is brought into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.439" offset="3645106">Then, this interpretation simply renders the membership clause redundant duplicate of the other portions of the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.757" offset="3686379">Nothing is left of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.197" offset="3696201">It is quite true again that, in the majority opinion in the Whitney case, there are some remarks that might be used to buttress this view that membership is the same as conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.119" offset="3743848">It seems to me that Justice Brandeis' opinion is very clear on his point and, even if he had not done this task for us, I think the differences between conspiracy and membership are plain enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.673" offset="3786062">You have to charge if there are coconspirators.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.234" offset="3796302">You have to name them if you know the names.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.551" offset="3805602">There are no conspirators named here, no coconspirators.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.614" offset="3817827">There has to be an agreement in pursuit of some unlawful objective or method.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.769" offset="3834441">There is no agreement charged here.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.728" offset="3842278">Under the statute, in federal courts, you have an overt act, that's not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.072" offset="3859623">So, none of those elements that constitute conspiracy, that are part of the safeguards around that defense are present here, and it seems to me wholly impossible to simply say this is a conspiracy statute and punish it on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.986" offset="3923362">Now, the Government's defense of this statute is a little different.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.333" offset="3944678">They like the result reached by the court below, but there seems to be some distrust of the logic because they have gone about it a little differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.793" offset="3974562">They seek to save the statute by extensive judicial amendment by reading into the statute words which are not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.380" offset="4024926">In our reply brief, on page 2, we have set forth the membership clause as it would be, if you read into it, the various words which the Government seeks to import.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.707" offset="4074245">I might say that one word they import is left out of there and that is “intent.”</text>
            <text syncTime="996.689" offset="4090128">It is arguable that intent could be implied into the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.027" offset="4103502">We think not for reasons given in the brief, but even if that hurdle be jumped then the Government wishes to read in all the italicized words on page 2 there, so it would read “or becomes or is an active court pursued, rigidly disciplined, high-level member of or affiliates with any tightly disciplined quasi-military, deeply conspirational such society.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.480" offset="4197334">Come right back to conspiracy again, not quite all the way back perhaps, as the lower court did, but certainly very close to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.259" offset="4232443">Well, now, I think that method simply will not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.425" offset="4249057">What the Government has done, of course, is to confuse what may be proved in a particular case about an individual or an organization with what may be read into the statute and the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.904" offset="4302973">It seems to me, it is indefensible as a matter of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.340" offset="4320737">Chief Justice Taft has had something to say about this sort of problem years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.257" offset="4344351">He called this making the statute a nose of wax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.356" offset="4360756">He was dealing with an identical situation, a Philippine statute, at which the constitutionality was dubious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.507" offset="4385416">The council made efforts to amend it, just as is being done here by reading in the many words that went there, and this was the phrase that Justice Taft -- Chief Justice Taft used in saying that would not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.484" offset="4437347">He also observed that the words that are in the statute “or affiliates with,” this covers not only membership but affiliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.229" offset="4472247">It's clearly suggest to me that Congress envisaged getting at a loser sort of association here than the Government is now trying to confine it to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.165" offset="4512057">Well, I will not labor the arguments on constitutionality further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.127" offset="4531911">I think I have made a fair and full statement of our contentions on it, and I would now like to pass onto the new issues that have arisen here involving the constitutionality as applied in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1163.765" offset="4758444">One of the problems arises out of one of these words that is attempted to be read in here, the word “active.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.256" offset="4788433">When the case was here before, the Solicitor General, in his supplemental memorandum, suggested that the statute should be applied so as to cover only active membership in the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.069" offset="4835662">I think Justice Harlan, you had considerable colloquy with the Government on that point at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.091" offset="4859695">In that memorandum, they suggested that this is not an element of the offense in the sense that it has to be put to the jury and found by the jury, but is what they call an overwriting constitutional limitation to be found by the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.147" offset="4915911">Well, we don't think that much can be said for that view but how that might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.200" offset="4936182">When this case is on trial, the Government requested that the jury be instructed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1234.008" offset="5039417">Yes, it's on page 841, Chief Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.431" offset="5057076">It was first determined whether he was an active member, not enough that he simply be a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.171" offset="5084035">Now, in this Court, the Solicitor General has reverted to his original position here and says that that is not a question for the jury, but is a question for the Court, what clear and present danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.986" offset="5131368">Of course we don't think that the word should be read into the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.218" offset="5148296">We don't think, if it were read into, would help very much on constitutionality because, as the Yates case certainly held, activity by itself is insufficient for any criminal implications here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.833" offset="5198660">The indictment says nothing about activity and we made timely objection to the failure to make that -- to allege that element if the Government were going to rely on it as an element of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.653" offset="5242023">But, all this now seems rather academic because the Court didn't find activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.926" offset="5267101">It sent it to the jury and, so, on the Government's own theory, there was error committed by sending it to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.563" offset="5297612">The situation can be better understood in the light of the Noto case, pending here, which was tried before the Solicitor General espoused the activity limitation and, therefore, there was no instruction there about activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.286" offset="5344528">It didn't go to jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.513" offset="5353409">So, there is a problem there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.292" offset="5364590">It seems to us that this is one of the pitfalls of reading into a statute, words -- after a case have been tried, words that aren't there and can't reasonably be implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.641" offset="5409938">Now, another and I think even more serious problem as the statute as applied here arises out of the evidence introduced to meet the criteria laid down in the Yates case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.212" offset="5472214">The Court said in the Yates case that there must be proof of advocacy which amounts to concrete action for forcible overthrow of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.740" offset="5510353">It seems to us that the prosecution, in this case, overlooked those last words, “for forcible overthrow,” and went on the assumption that if you could show incitement to action of any kind that that was going to meet the standard of the Yates case with the result which I will now come to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.666" offset="5590079">The evidence in question here, Your Honors, consists of Government Exhibits 64, 65, and 66 and they appear in the record between pages A18 and A22.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.567" offset="5653608">They don't appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.126" offset="5655907">They are quite complete, but the bulk of the three exhibits are there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.609" offset="5677850">These are three documents which strongly attack American policy in Korea and conduct of the War in Korea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.074" offset="5703659">They are publications a pamphlet, an article, and a book.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.147" offset="5723930">And especially Government Exhibit 66 which is this book, extracts and which appear on page A21.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.308" offset="5760606">The Court will see that this is a very repellant document.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.623" offset="5773876">I will forebear to read what is there, but it is indeed a repellant document.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.640" offset="5801984">But, for all the unattractive features of these documents, there's nothing in there that has anything to do, so far as we can see within inciting the violent overthrow of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.646" offset="5849945">Nevertheless, these were three documents out of a group of about half-a-dozen that the Government offered at the trial for the specific purpose avowed in colloquy at the bench, which appears in the record here, that these were being offered to prove incitement to action in order to meet the standards described in the Yates case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.028" offset="5935522">There was objection from the defense.There was extensive colloquy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.686" offset="5950151">There was more argument about the -- the judge reserved his ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.561" offset="5965615">There is more argument about it after the Government's case closed when we had our motion to -- for a directed verdict of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.364" offset="6000828">When the judge denied the motion for acquittal, he, at the same time, ruled on this group of documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.211" offset="6024234">He allowed these three to be received and excluded about three others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.402" offset="6045027">He did not say why he excluded the ones he excluded, why he received the ones that he received.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.303" offset="6072613">After they had been thus received, these three documents that aren't guarded, the prosecution then read extensively from these documents to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.316" offset="6116603">They then made a special request that these documents be sent to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.985" offset="6135306">The defense moved for mistrial on the ground that the documents were both remote and exceedingly prejudicial and inflammatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.053" offset="6159548">That was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.909" offset="6166967">The prosecution then, after the evidence was closed, in its summation to the jury, specifically called the jury's attention to this Exhibit 66 here and asked the jury to see whether or not there is language in that exhibit that would incite you to action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.948" offset="6263202">In other words, this document was relied on expressly before the jury to prove incitement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.260" offset="6284413">We asked for charge to -- so the jury would not feel free to find incitement on the basis of this document -- this sort of document alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.115" offset="6323806">It was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.056" offset="6327568">The Government objected and it was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.348" offset="6340733">Now, we suggest to the Court that this raises a most profound constitutional problem that if, on the theory of the court below and the Government, documents which are nothing more than polemical attacks on Government policy which consist of publications, books, articles, and so forth which are means of expression expressly protected by the First Amendment, if those can be relied on as evidence of incitement to violent overthrow and if, indeed, the jury can be left free to find incitement on the basis of that alone, that this indeed has ran afoul of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.671" offset="6514082">We think that the theory of the court below that because this is a thing which blackens the Government's reputation and so its dissention, that that means that it is weakening the Government against the potential revolution, that this theory would carry it so far that there will be very little indeed left for the protection of the First Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2019.324" offset="8180694">Would there not be a danger that registration as a Communist would incriminate one and could they not, therefore, decline to registration pleading the Fifth Amendment?</text>

            <text syncTime="2030.422" offset="8225102">1950, 10 years later, Justice Stewart, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.477" offset="8237328">And, this danger which might arise to the functioning of the statute from the plea of the Fifth Amendment was pointed out to Congress by the late John W. Davis in a letter and it was his letter which led to this language now in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.763" offset="8294379">Originally, that language only applied to Sections 4 (a) and 4 (c) of the Internal Security Act itself, but then it was amended on the floor by adding the phrase “any other criminal statute,” and the legislative history shows pretty clearly that that was done with the membership clause in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.934" offset="8363133">So, with this language in front of us and knowing the purpose, how do we interpret it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.040" offset="8387584">The Government says that the words “per se” show that this is only to apply to membership without more, that it does not apply to membership plus knowledge and, therefore, is not a part of this sort of prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.364" offset="8448815">The Government uses the phrase “mere membership,” that this is a bar to the prosecution for mere membership but not for membership with knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.762" offset="8486431">We do not think this view will stand analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.208" offset="8500224">We think it does bar prosecutions of Communists under the membership clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.790" offset="8518510">It bars prosecutions unless there is other evidence of criminally significant acts or conducts, such as under the substantive provisions of the Smith Act or elsewhere in federal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.199" offset="8556126">Now, what is the matter with the Government's position here?</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.699" offset="8570128">To begin with, so that we go to the face of the statute before legislative history, on its face here, Section 4 (f) doesn't apply merely to membership and there are the words “or the holding of office,” so that it goes outside of membership right on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.916" offset="8638986">And, the significance of that is rather greater than the mere presence of those words, “office holding.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.852" offset="8670751">In the Government's brief, for example, when they come to the matter of how evidence is to be weighed, we find that the Government, and I'm looking at the Government's brief, page 85, Scales was an officer of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.715" offset="8746193">He had been Chairman of the District of North Carolina and we find, in the Government's brief at page 85, acknowledging his role as a party functionary, that is an officer, petitioner contends that the evidence is not enough to show his knowledge of the Party's character, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.563" offset="8809618">Then, it goes on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.152" offset="8812022">Of course, Petitioner's status as a leader of such a rigidly disciplined and indoctrinated organization is, in itself, strong evidence against the suggestion that he might have not known what the party was about or might not have purposed the furtherance of its ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.676" offset="8882030">Now, I don't know much Latin but “in itself” I think means, in simple English, the very same thing as those Latin words “per se” in Section 4 (f).</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.864" offset="8918810">And, if we are confronted with a situation where being an officer is, in itself, strong evidence of knowledge and intent and if being an officer is not guilt and cannot be under Section 4 (f), it seems to me, plain enough, that Section 4 (f) does comprehend something more than what the Government calls mere membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.906" offset="9007000">Office holding does carry with it, according to the Government itself, evidentiary implication in terms of knowledge and intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.417" offset="9041063">So, on the face of the statute, that view, we think, will not stand up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.406" offset="9061021">The Government's position, we think, is also squarely in the face of basic questions and basic principles of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.315" offset="9100622">A base -- such a basic principle is to give effect to the words of the statute, so they're not nugatory and redundant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.422" offset="9133014">Section 4 (f) applies specifically to Subsections 4 (a) and (c), and via the phrase “any other criminal statute” to the membership clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.106" offset="9179826">All three of those statutes, Section (a), Section (c), and the membership clause, all specifically require knowledge as an element of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.061" offset="9223607">So that, if we say 4 (f) applies only where there is knowledge, there is absolutely no statute, no part of the Internal Security Act which can apply, no other statute which can apply, and it is left with absolutely nothing to apply to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.267" offset="9288391">Finally, though, I think we do have to look to some extent of the congressional purpose here and, if we do, it becomes even plainer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.593" offset="9321723">What Congress wanted to do is to create an effective system of registration of Communist Party members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.369" offset="9352861">To do that, it had to, so far as possible, remove the bar of the Fifth Amendment so that people could decline to register on the ground of self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.542" offset="9393507">Whether it was successful doing that is not at issue here but, certainly, that's what they were trying to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.032" offset="9419525">Now, the effect -- the practical effect of the Government's construction here is that only those Communists who do not know the teachings of the party could be required to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.830" offset="9474696">All the others would remain subject to prosecution under the membership clause for membership plus knowledge, could plead the Fifth Amendment, and defeat registration that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.827" offset="9510640">So that, it seems to us that, in terms of congressional purpose, this would simply reduce the Act to a futility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.304" offset="9532583">The Government says again and again, in its brief, that it seems inconceivable that Congress would have exempted Communists from the membership clause in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.722" offset="9574275">We think that overlooks that there are a variety of legislative techniques for dealing with Communism and its relation to Internal Security.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.271" offset="9608443">In 1950, Congress, we think, made a judgment that it was more important for this registration system to function than to -- than to prosecute members under the membership clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.713" offset="9658180">It's a very easy one to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.777" offset="9662464">There had been substantially no prosecutions under the membership clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.536" offset="9677511">The other provisions of the Smith Act remained available anyhow and, so, it would have been entirely compatible with congressional intent to say it's much more important that we make this machine work than to keep on the books a clause which hadn't been put to any practical use up to that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="2527.039" offset="10211558">It stands to reason, I think, that when the Government has tried 17 or 18 Smith Act cases over the course of five or six years, it is very difficult to prove different things about the Communist Party the 19th time when you prove maybe the eighth attempt.</text>
