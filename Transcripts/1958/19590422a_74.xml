            <text syncTime="29.806" offset="222647">The petitioners in case number 74, Henry J. Mills and Osmond J. Litolff at a time when the United States grand jury was investigating the question of violations of the income tax laws and other felonies under the laws of United States, in reference to certain officers of the police department of the City of New Orleans, these particular applicants, petitioners were called before the state grand jury for the Parish of Orleans, State of Louisiana and interrogated by the state district attorney for the Parish of Orleans, State of Louisiana and during the course of that investigation and interrogation before the state grand jury were asked certain questions concerning their individual connection and operation of lotteries in the City of New Orleans, were asked with whom they had been associated in the lottery business in the City of New Orleans, whether they had ever paid bribe money to the New Orleans Police Department with or anybody had paid it with their knowledge and that the grand jury was investigating the subject of bribery and graft on the part of the police department of the City of New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.871" offset="514905">Presenting to the district attorney in the sanctum of the grand jury room and before the grand jury a written statement, each petitioner respectfully declined to answer the questions claiming the benefit of the Fifth Amendment expressing the specific fear of federal prosecution for a violation of a federal income tax laws and other federal laws as such answers might incriminate them or intend to incriminate them, or might furnish a chain of evidence, or link in a chain of evidence which could become the basis of subsequent prosecutions under the laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.248" offset="656384">Each petitioner specifically claimed that he was in actual and immediate danger of federal prosecution by the United States under the income tax laws and other federal laws or all felonies as he was under investigation by the investigating officers of the United States of America, particularly the United States officials concerning the Internal Revenue Service concerning their income tax returns for the year '48 to '56 inclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.108" offset="771845">That they had been required by the officers of the United States Internal Revenue Service to sign waivers against prescription for the statute of limitations concerning their income tax returns for the years '48 to '51 so as to afford the federal officers an opportunity to proceed against petitioner should any violation of the law be discovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.589" offset="861706">At the period of criminal -- statute of limitations on criminal prosecutions arising under the federal income tax laws a period of six years had not expired.</text>

            <text syncTime="219.561" offset="981661">That the -- at that time these petitioners were being interrogated federal indictments had been returned by the United States grand jury against the members of the New Orleans police department, three for income tax evasions and eight for perjury.</text>

            <text syncTime="267.517" offset="1173400">Well the record does show this, it bears out this fact, but doesn't show exactly what Your Honor Mr. Justice Frankfurter asks, but it is an admitted fact that these two men had been engaged in the operation of lotteries for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.890" offset="1222928">That was why they were called before the state grand jury to find out whether they had been permitted to operate with the permission of the police department and had paid bribes for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.034" offset="1259499">However neither one of these two men claimed any fear of any state prosecution, my two clients, but they did base their contention exclusively and solely on the fact that they might be prosecuted under the federal laws for felonies which might arise as a result of testimony forced from their lips.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.191" offset="1332120">But the basis of their appeal to Your Honors is this, that there exists and the record bears this out, the contention made in the written statement that there exists collaboration and cooperation between the district attorney for the Parish of Orleans and the United States attorney for the Eastern district of Louisiana and the Internal Revenue Service of the United States and its investigators for the -- regarding public bribery and income tax evasions, record Page 46.</text>

            <text syncTime="386.385" offset="1648933">Now I am not unmindful of the fact that Your Honors have held in a number of cases that under the doctrine of two sovereignties rule, the privilege against self incrimination provided for by the Fifth Amendment protects only against the invasion of civil liberties by the government and has no application, and in those instances wherein a witness is asked questions in a State Court which might incriminate him in a federal -- for a federal offense Your Honors in Feldman versus United States and Barron versus Baltimore and Brown versus Walker and a number of cases said in my brief have held that such a witness could not claim the benefits of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.793" offset="1806503">However it is a significant fact that in those cases which have a approved the two sovereignties rule wherein Your Honor have held, that Your Honors indicated that that rule applied, Your Honors have indicated that there was in fact no danger of federal prosecution in that jurisdiction and that where such a threat did exist, one way or another, the witness was protected from incriminating himself in the second jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="582.786" offset="2434487">If a federal officer should be a party to the compulsion of testimony by state agencies, the protection of the Fifth Amendment would come into play such testimony is barred in a federal prosecution citing Byars versus United States and there are a number, there are number of other decisions such as the Macanese case, in support of what his Honor Mr. Justice Frankfurter enumerated in his opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.163" offset="2548067">Now one of the case is cited in support of the Two Sovereignties Rule is that Feldman versus United States, 322 United States 487 and if my memory serves to be correct and if I not I hope Your Honors will just know that its an unintentional error, I think his honor Mr. Justice Frankfurter also stated as dictum in that case on page 494, “If that Federal agency want to use a state court as an instrument for compelling disclosures for Federal purposes the doctrine of the Byars case as well as the McNabb versus United States case of what adequate resources against such an evasive disregard of the privilege against self incrimination citing some of the minority cases originally, United States versus (Inaudible) and so forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="2450.625" offset="9905821">Example one, witness X before a Grand Jury investigation, investigating public bribery, is told that he has immunity under those statutes which I read to Your Honors and the following ensues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.054" offset="9967574">Question - Do you know officers, police officers A and B, answer yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.298" offset="10000593">Question - Did you ever give them any money, answer, yes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2482.378" offset="10032880">So they wouldn't raid my gambling house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.838" offset="10050748">What happens now?</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.165" offset="10056077">X is not charged with bribery for which he has immunity under those statutes, but he is charged with a revised statute 1490, the gambling statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.726" offset="10102262">His testimony is not used against him, but the testimony of A and B is used against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.317" offset="10140609">And how did they get the A and B as witnesses, only as a result of that grand jury investigation on something else, where he was cloaked with this set of bribe immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.337" offset="10188675">The result he is convicted of an offense of which the grand jury had no knowledge until drawn from him under that pretext of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.623" offset="10221902">Now example two is even more serious, policeman A has been shot by person or persons unknown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.827" offset="10250637">Witness X appears before a grand jury investigating public bribery just as this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.594" offset="10277700">Witness, he is loaned into a sense of security with the immunity routine and this ensues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.388" offset="10308942">Question - Did you pay any money to any policeman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.106" offset="10319809">Yes sir; To whom, policeman A; Why, so he wouldn't raid my handbook.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.468" offset="10357217">What did he do with the money?</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.382" offset="10364949">He didn't do anything but raised hell that it wasn't enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.608" offset="10381772">Did you give him anymore?</text>

            <text syncTime="2572.844" offset="10394728">He started to arrest me and I shot him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.118" offset="10411865">If anything more he added to say, but to observe that but except for this blanket of spurious immunity well for which the grand jury wrapped this witness X of, if you are a policeman A, would still be a policeman or no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.510" offset="10465364">Now example three is drawn from actual questions before the grand jury and I have already called Your Honor's attention to that fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="2693.464" offset="10877262">That was a dissent I understand that Justice, but what you said in that encoding Boyd versus United States I think still stands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.285" offset="10920521">In Boyd versus United States that any compulsory discovery by starting the party's oath is contrary to the principles of free government, it is a bar to the instincts of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.200" offset="10976214">It may suit the purpose of dissipating power but it cannot abide the pure atmosphere of personal and political freedom and I think those words were well said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.667" offset="11033997">But Justice Frankfurter has cited with approval what was said in the Murdoch case, the principle established answering Justice Harlan is a full and complete immunity against prosecution by the government compelling the witness to answer is equivalent to the protection furnished by the rule against compulsory self incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.411" offset="11140995">But the immunity statutes of the Louisiana don't give you that full and complete immunity and if Justice Harlan as you suggested we had none then that exactly would be violation of the due process of law guaranteed to us under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.237" offset="11224273">But if Your Honors, I didn't go any further on that, the answer of Mr. Mills a hypothetical answer to that question that was actually propounded to him, I had Golden Bell lottery and what happens on page 17 I suggest that what happens actually did happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.634" offset="11313925">I cited to you those cases that were actually filed for the violation of that particular fictitious name registration and I cite them now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.444" offset="11365125">We believe though that this particular judgment with regard to my client Mills is contrary to amendment 9 of the United States Constitution which reads the enumeration and the constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others routine by the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.695" offset="11478183">Now I am sure that Justice Clark is well acquainted with Mr. Bennett Patterson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.375" offset="11496887">I don't know if you are familiar with the very illuminating book that he wrote called The Forgotten Ninth Amendment and I quote that, part, relative to part that is applicable to our case on page 19 of my brief and I also cite that the Ninth Amendment applies to states which this Court has held in (Inaudible) versus District Court and in Falco versus Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.599" offset="11617782">Now what are some of these unenumerated rights?</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.965" offset="11639202">It must be conceded, now this is Savings and Loan versus Topeka and Everson v. Board of Education, it must be conceded that there are such rights in every free government beyond the control of the State a government which recognizes no such right, which held the lives of liberty and the property of its citizens subject at all times to the absolute disposition and unlimited control of even the most democratic depository of power is after all but a despotism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.530" offset="11793533">Now suppose the Louisiana or any other states should enact a statute enabling one with a fancy claim against another to require that other person to disclose to him, Justice Black that's on page 20, to disclose to him detail -- all details of that transactions prior to the filing of a suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.702" offset="11918190">There is no probation in any constitution against any really -- such ridiculous procedure, but the right of privacy as to business transactions until added by due process of law in inherent in all individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.514" offset="11977435">Will there be any doubt what Your Honors would do with such a statute, yet that is exactly the situation with regard to my client in number 75.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.115" offset="12015783">If this petitioner were forced under the provisions of the Louisiana constitution and revised statutes to answer the question about his occupation during 1950 to 1955, the one that I read to Your Honors, and other questions that would inheritably have followed the provisions right upon by the grand jury would in effect become just such as hypothetical statute as suggested above.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.020" offset="12135424">But petitioner might then lay himself liable to a multiplicity of suits and actions, including suits by the United States Government, for income tax, gambling tax, gambling stamp and so on, none of which would have ever been instituted, but for that answer extracted for him under the cloak of fancied immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.034" offset="12235525">Now that's not a hypothetical case that I'm suggesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.832" offset="12254751">It actually happened in New Orleans and as I show you on page 21 of my brief, as substantiated by the admitted state of the facts, in the printed record, these suits were filed for occupational licenses by the City of New Orleans against men engaged in similar businesses as was my client.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.572" offset="12349628">In fact one of them was his son, August J. Mills Jr. I won't take anymore of Your Honor's time, except to thank you for the privilege of having this oral argument and to point out once more that, that forgotten Ninth Amendment is worthy of considerable thought and is applicable to both states and the federal government, thank you sir.</text>

            <text syncTime="3110.095" offset="12543770">Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.595" offset="12557772">I first want to present the compliments of my Attorney General Mr. Jack Gremillion and express his regret for not being able to be with you gentlemen today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.910" offset="12599045">On my behalf I again appreciate the honor and privilege of once again addressing you in a short period of less than a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.439" offset="12633109">In this particular case, if Your Honors please, I don't find any case that is exactly a positive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.899" offset="12686921">I start with the premise that from the case of Brown versus Walker, right up until the present moment, the self incrimination has never been held to be a fundamental right under the constitution of the United States, nor has it held to be a privilege in immunity, under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.684" offset="12822131">Now that has been a unanimity of opinion in the decisions, but not necessarily the unanimity of opinion among the various members of the Court over a period of years since Twining versus New Jersey up until today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.895" offset="12890990">In Brown versus Walker, the rule is clearly stated that self incrimination was merely a rule of evidence in England.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.932" offset="12935084">It became close in this country with impregnability of a constitutional amendment and that constitutional amendment as Your Honors will know was put in by four states of the original (Inaudible) as a restriction on the power of the federal government -- from tyranny by the federal government against the state government's citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.501" offset="13041351">The principle of the law is annunciated, without question, in Wigmore versus -- Wigmore in evidence in the third edition which Your Honors have quoted in Knapp versus Schweitzer and which the rule of law is distinctly stated the Federal Fifth Amendment of course, and notice wording of Professor Wigmore's evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.950" offset="13131212">The Federal Fifth Amendment of course applies in federal trials only, nor does the Federal Fourteenth Amendment make the provisions of the Fifth Amendment in the present respect to the privilege and immunity of citizens of the United States, so as to be protected and reviewable by the Federal Supreme Court as against a violation by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.207" offset="13216162">Mr. Stanley in a supplementary brief here today and in his argument talk about a very wonderful Article written by Dr. Grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.308" offset="13288573">Dr. Grant is the Dean of Division of social Science in the UCLA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.000" offset="13327339">That's been a pet theory of Dr. Grant's for 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.392" offset="13344893">He wrote his first Article on that in the Tampa Law Review back in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.488" offset="13369344">This is more or less a revamping of his original Article.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.955" offset="13387212">However, as Justice Frankfurter called attention, he himself, talking now about Dr. Grant, in his own Article says this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.167" offset="13432038">The most remarkable fact is that not one of the cases, now he has reviewed Fagan and all the other cases Mr. Stanley referred to, he referred -- took over the Sicily cases, all of the jurisprudence up until 1958, the most remarkable fact is that not one of the cases involving British federalism, has so much as discussed the issue from a dual sovereignty angle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.812" offset="13534647">In fact this maybe due to the (Inaudible) of the English common law, even as applied to foreign nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.630" offset="13569860">He himself admits that the issue has never been discussed for a good and sufficient reason, that you only have one sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.660" offset="13597968">We certainly have two sovereigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.267" offset="13612492">In fact in our own state was where the issue first came up with dual sovereignty in the slaughterhouse cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.176" offset="13652093">Since that time there has been innumerable cases that arose of the State of Louisiana, in civil as well as in criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.325" offset="13680724">Davidson versus New Orleans, (Inaudible) versus Louisiana in a case that I argued here about four years ago, State of Louisiana ex rel. Francis against Resweber, in which that same principal of dual sovereignty upheld by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.494" offset="13741328">There have been cases all over the United States, where the dual sovereignty theory has been upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.196" offset="13764106">To say that the Fourteenth Amendment wound encompass the Fifth Amendment, would throw out the entire constitutional theories of dual sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.661" offset="13798066">Absolutely throw it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.573" offset="13805693">No state in the United States could possibly administer its own criminal justice, if that was correct law there was no such thing as dual sovereignty, if there is, on which all of these cases have been based.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.929" offset="13863058">As to the Fifth Amendment itself, Your Honors have specifically held and in at least 30 cases to my knowledge, that the Fifth Amendment does not and cannot apply to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.565" offset="13925648">As to the Fourteenth Amendment, Your Honors have held in Twining versus New Jersey, Palko versus Connecticut, Adamson versus California, the last case Knapp versus Schweitzer that the Fourteenth Amendment has not encompassed the Fifth and has no regulatory power on self incrimination insofar as the state itself is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.181" offset="14028048">As to the use of the testimony in the State Courts, I mean use in the federal courts from the state sources, I think Your Honors have definitely decided that in the Feldman case, the Bryar's and McNabb cases, that wherever there is actually collusion, Mr. Stanley said he didn't want to use that word collusion, if there is actually collusion of courts, federal judges would throw it right out the window.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.664" offset="14154062">In other words, the District Attorney in this particular case, the Honorable Leon Hubert, was a former Assistant United States District Attorney, a Professor of Criminal Law and is still Professor at one of universities at Tulane, Mr. (Inaudible) is a high class gentleman, the United States District Attorney, the two federal judges in New Orleans, one of whom is my classmate, (Inaudible) and the other who was my sponsor before this Court, Judge Wright, certainly wouldn't tolerate any such unethical comic by United States District Attorney, now our State District Attorney and Mr. Stanley knows those gentlemen and their reputation as well as I do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.171" offset="14312051">Again I call Your Honor's attention to the fact, this is strictly a Grand Jury proceeding, and we are very particular about our Grand Jury proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.939" offset="14355101">We weren't so particular in our selection and we got thrown out on that nine to nothing, but as far as -- I reported the last case if Your Honor please, State versus (Inaudible), I always believe in taking about my law as well as my (Inaudible) [Laughter], but there is no attack in this case on our Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.073" offset="14435662">There is no attack on the charge given to our Grand Jury and our Grand Jury must charge, our judges must charge that Grand Jury, as soon as they sworn in, the law of bribery including Article 121, which is an immunity granted by the legislature far beyond the constitution itself, talking about immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.185" offset="14556139">Now I'd like to just briefly touch on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.248" offset="14592397">Louisiana is one of two states that you don't have a privilege of self incrimination at all in a bribery case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.730" offset="14642343">We don't give it to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.180" offset="14652061">We don't give it to you at all in our constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.866" offset="14666794">In other words, Louisiana and Pennsylvania have exactly the same constitutional provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.578" offset="14689677">Our Article I, Section 11, is the same as Pennsylvania's Article I, Section 9, which is the same as the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.177" offset="14740041">Our Article 19 which is cited by both gentlemen in their briefs our Article 19, Section 13 is exactly the same as Pennsylvania's Article III, Section 32 except that they combine in their Article 32, our Sections 12 and 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.278" offset="14820498">Our Section 12 and the Article 19 defines what is bribery.</text>

            <text syncTime="3691.132" offset="14867937">We do give you in the constitution itself the right to that testimony alone cannot be used against you, then the legislature to complement and implement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3742.260" offset="15072423">The Pennsylvania constitution was in 1874 and the wording is exactly similar where it simply uses the words that the evidence cannot be used.</text>

            <text syncTime="3756.944" offset="15131146">Now in Counselman versus Hitchcock is the only case that I find where there is any mention at all as what this Court might do, where the proposition was not the extent of immunity offered under a state court statute to compensate for the loss of privilege under the constitution, or where it was actually in the constitution itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.085" offset="15235741">(Inaudible) in Counselman versus Hitchcock it says the situation would be entirely different where that was done in the constitution and reason for that to me is very (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.480" offset="15293315">If the state of Louisiana and the state of Pennsylvania incidentally they set a Philadelphia lawyer to figure these things out but the Philadelphia lawyers figured it out, Commonwealth versus Haynes is the leading case on it in which exactly the same situation took place in the City of Philadelphia, as we had in the city of New Orleans.</text>

            <text syncTime="3846.305" offset="15488606">It's an exception to the general rule in our constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3850.269" offset="15504488">Article 19, Section 13 is the exception to the Article 1, Section 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="3855.455" offset="15525177">Now insofar as the state court jurisprudence is concerned, Mr. Stanley personally handled State versus (Inaudible) and I congratulate him upon his victory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.136" offset="15575960">We asked for rehearing and case was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3872.616" offset="15593827">The Supreme Court of Louisiana did not follow its original jurisprudence in State versus Rodriguez which was the seven to nothing we have seven members on our Court, unanimous seven and nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3884.213" offset="15640221">State versus Dominguez was four to three.</text>
            <text syncTime="3888.079" offset="15655685">Now in that four to three, the case next came up which Mr. Stanley did mention State versus Ford, Your Honor will find that in Judge Cox's decision and State versus Ford was written by the later beloved my former client, Justice Maurice in which State versus Ford although he had been in the majority opinion, in State versus Dominguez he revised the law, but did not come out with a direct reversal of the opinion written in State versus Dominguez and went on a basis of distinguishing the case because in the Dominguez case the man was actually under indictment and in Ford he wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3930.366" offset="15824854">In this particular instance here, in State versus Ford, State versus Rodriguez the Chief Justice, Justice Fournet was in a majority opinion, he had been in a minority in state versus Dominguez, he is back in the majority in state versus Ford and he is a minority in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3952.013" offset="15911476">In other words, Mr. William's case our courts did five to two and Mr. Stanley's case five to one and Justice Fournet took no part.</text>

            <text syncTime="4092.749" offset="16474363">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4095.596" offset="16485752">Let me say in the beginning that I certainly appreciate also the opportunity of appearing here before the Court and presenting our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4104.946" offset="16523160">I think for just a few moments I would like to summarize briefly and a few observations what seems to be the issue in the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4114.417" offset="16561089">I think we're confronted here with a very narrow issue in a very broad field and the issue seems to be this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4123.057" offset="16595571">From the holding of the Court in Knapp versus Schweitzer, the door was left open for a situation where there might be such collaboration between the federal and the state authorities as to vitiate any testimony elicited under immunity statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4143.611" offset="16677804">The Knapp case was almost a parallel case in this, Knapp was called before the Grand Jury and declined to testify even though he had been given immunity and he was convicted of contempt, just as the defendants in these cases were convicted, and the doors as I say was left open to determine whether or not in a proper case any collaboration between state and federal authorities would vitiate such testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="4171.970" offset="16791280">Now the question we're confronted with it seems to me is this, there are two phases to it; one assuming that there was such collaboration and I think Mr. Justice Frankfurter described it as illicit acquisition, I think the collaboration or cooperation would have to be of such nature, as to be an illicit acquisition type, in order to vitiate the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="4195.731" offset="16886262">But assuming that there was such collaboration, the question then would be, would the Court here stop the state from compelling the testimony under the immunity granted by the state, or would the Court here simply say that any such testimony elicited under the immunity statute, could not thereafter be introduced in evidence in a federal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4217.543" offset="16973511">Now that's what was done in the Feldman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4219.117" offset="16979884">The Court said that evidence elicited in that manner can be used in a subsequent prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4224.699" offset="17002141">The question before the Court today is, if this testimony, which the defendants Mills and so on declined to give under the immunity granted by the state, if that testimony was obtained by forcing such testimony, would the Court here restrain the State of Louisiana from going on and compelling it or would the Court say that, that testimony possibly might not be used in a subsequent federal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4253.629" offset="17117915">Now reviewing the facts on the basis of that proposition, we have a stipulation in the transcript which has been referred to by Mr. Stanley and Mr. Williams, agreed to between the District Attorney and counsel for the defense and the only three points there that I'll call the Court's attention to, that in any way relates to the collaboration and cooperation, those three points are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="4280.286" offset="17224495">One there were conferences admitted between the Federal District Attorney and the State District Attorney with reference not to these defendants, not to these defendants who are lottery operators, but to certain members of the police department of the City of New Orleans, now that's as far as you go.</text>
            <text syncTime="4297.659" offset="17293981">There was no collaboration, no cooperation with reference to any information by these particular defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4304.454" offset="17321148">The second thing is there were indictments returned against certain members of the police department, not these defendants and I call Your Honors' attention to that, but members of the police department, and then the third thing that was suggested was that there was a waiver signed by these defendants in connection with income tax assessments by the federal revenue department.</text>
            <text syncTime="4326.678" offset="17410069">Now I'll go in sort of reverse order, take the waiver that was pointed out by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4333.675" offset="17438072">These defendants had some eight months, at the very earliest and in the case of Mr. Mills it was some 12 months before, signed a waiver with the Federal Revenue Authorities stating that more time would be allowed in effect for them to -- for the federal government to determine what tax liability they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="4352.637" offset="17513932">Now that waiver as I say was signed some seven months in one case and 12 months in the other case, before this case ever came before the Grand Jury, and I call Your Honor's attention to the letter on page 80 of the transcript of Mr. Stanley's, the letter by Mr. Blake from the Revenue Department address to Mr. and Mrs. Mills, it's page 81, and I call Your Honor's attention to the language of that as indicating that there was no possible basis for Mr. and Mrs. Mills fearing an income tax prosecution on the basis of the kind of letter they received there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4386.830" offset="17650709">Here is the way the letter closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4387.968" offset="17655202">It is desired to assure you that it is the purpose of this office to proceed to a final determination of the tax liability as expeditiously as possible, and your cooperation to that end will be appreciated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4400.600" offset="17705775">And I submit to Your Honors that doesn't suggest that the federal tax authorities were in any sense posing an imminent threat of federal prosecution of income tax evasion by Mr. and Mrs. Mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="4411.473" offset="17749243">Now getting back to the cooperation proposition, I think Your Honors can assume that that in any case, that there will be cooperation between the Federal District Attorney and the State District Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="4423.433" offset="17797099">If there is not that kind of cooperation, somebody is not doing his duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4427.969" offset="17815280">Now the federal government is naturally interested in income tax problems, I mean that's a concern with all of us.</text>
            <text syncTime="4434.105" offset="17839835">In this particular type of case the men or the people that they were after were the policemen who had received the money, because they wanted to know, they wanted to get the tax from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4443.216" offset="17876198">It seems to be a particular problem with federal as well as state authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4447.530" offset="17893543">They are not concerned sometimes as much with the actual crime or violation as with saying that the proper tax is paid on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4455.079" offset="17923636">Mississippi you know has the only other prohibition statute, but they still tax (Inaudible) law in Mississippi on a black market tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="4463.585" offset="17957700">Well here it was the same proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4464.819" offset="17962611">Here policeman who presumably have been taking graft money and the federal government, and there's cooperation between the state and federal district attorney, wanted to know how much money they have been receiving.</text>
            <text syncTime="4476.195" offset="18008168">There was no suggestion of a threat against the lottery owner because they had given the money, that was the interest that the federal government had in the thing, so that the extent of the cooperation and collaboration in-between the district attorney and the federal district attorney could not amount to illicit acquisition which Mr. Justice Frankfurter has indicated, would be the standard by which the court would determine whether they had been such collaboration between state and federal authorities as to vitiate any testimony elicited under state immunity statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4508.559" offset="18137631">Now the third thing the indictment of the policeman which had taken place prior to this, I submit has no connection whatever to the issue that we are talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4518.150" offset="18175979">Mr. William's client, he says was actually indicted by this grand jury on the bribery charge, and I have to make reference to that fact because it might play some part in the court's consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4531.440" offset="18229164">Actually this indictment that he refers to was not an indictment for bribery, but it was an indictment for a conspiracy to commit bribery and a question was asked awhile ago what was the disposition of the case?</text>
            <text syncTime="4542.933" offset="18275140">The case was disposed by the Supreme Court of Louisiana about two weeks ago on a clear prescription.</text>
            <text syncTime="4548.423" offset="18297083">In other words, the Supreme Court of Louisiana held that all these cases had long since prescribed in the indictment which was returned by the grand jury against Mr. Mills and the policeman was thrown out on the basis of prescription by the Supreme Court about two weeks ago.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. David McNeill</label>
            <text syncTime="4566.879" offset="18370853">On the ground that more than two years had elapsed between the time the information relating to this had come to the attention of the district attorney and the time of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4577.256" offset="18412440">But at the time when the grand jury asked Mr. Mills these questions, he declined to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4582.554" offset="18433546">The matter was taken into the district judge and he was asked to cite the defendant for contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="4589.367" offset="18460818">The case was argued and then a continuance was asked by Mr. William's client.</text>
            <text syncTime="4596.506" offset="18489448">Then before the judge can hand down a judgment, I remind you the case had been presented, it was clearly apparent that Mr. Mills was not going to testify to the grand jury, he was not going to take advantage of his immunity, and he was going to take his chance of going to jail for contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="4610.930" offset="18547127">After that situation and after a continuance had been granted by the court to Mr. Mills on the basis of his request on account of illness, the grand jury brought in an indictment for this conspiracy to commit public bribery.</text>
            <text syncTime="4625.376" offset="18604910">And then a few days after that Judge Cox in a decision which is attached to the transcript, made part of the transcript, ruled that they were in contempt and sentenced the defendants to 10 days in jail and a $100 fine, but I'm pointing that out because I think it has no connection whatever to the issue that we're talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4645.324" offset="18684635">In other words, the indictment was not something that the Supreme Court referred to in the Dominguez case where Dominguez was actually under indictment at the time he was asked the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4654.398" offset="18720998">At the time these questions were propounded the defendant moved it was not under any indictment and actually indictment didn't come until after the fact that he was not going to take advantage of any immunity and was going to take his chance of going to jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="4665.993" offset="18767391">So on the basis of the facts that's presented by the record, we submit that there is nothing in this case that would distinguish it from the Knapp case or take it out of the ruling of the Knapp case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4679.104" offset="18819741">We submit that there has not been any such collaboration and cooperation even in the agreed statement of facts that would indicate any illicit acquisition of evidence by the federal government as a basis of this testimony to take it out of the ruling in the Knapp case and we submit in the second place that if the Court would define that as an alternative proposition, the Court should not grant the relief as asked for by these defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4702.359" offset="18912841">In other words, what they are asking for is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4704.585" offset="18921723">They are asking to be relieved of any obligation to testify on the basis they might be prosecuted in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="4711.736" offset="18950353">Now if the Court does that, the court will be doing what the Court has said it won't do, to interfere in the state's administration of its own criminal law, in the interpretation of its own law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4721.911" offset="18991000">We say even if that situation existed, the remedy would be to deny the use of the evidence and the presentation of the evidence in any subsequent federal prosecution, such was done in the Byars case, but we submit that question is not presented today because the facts in the case don't suggest that there had been the illicit acquisition of testimony or evidence or that there had been the collision that the Court has said would vitiate any testimony gained by the state or the federal government under immunity statutes.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eugene Stanley</label>
            <text syncTime="4764.777" offset="19162467">I think I have about six minutes if Your Honor please, I just want to point to Your Honors respectfully that at the time these interrogations were going on before the state grand jury by the state district attorney that the fear of a federal prosecution in the minds of the witnesses was not anyway doubtful or was real because the statute of limitations for the prosecution for any offenses against those particular people for violating the federal income tax laws or for a conspiracy to help others violate the federal income tax laws had not expired and they could have been subjected to a federal prosecution for those offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4812.789" offset="19354520">Now the Yale Law Journal says that since few states construe their constitutions to permit a witness to remain silent in the face of federal prosecution, Feldman may frequently enable the government to avail the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4831.102" offset="19427767">Seeking to exploit that decision federal authorities might prosecute a witness previously called before state proceedings to establish in which answers were compelled, sufficient to establish his guilt in the subsequent federal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4844.095" offset="19479803">The government might even have inspired the state interrogation where cooperation is quite common and collusion not unknown between federal and state officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="4853.807" offset="19518568">Furthermore the latitude on their own initiative (Inaudible) inquiries designed to support -- to design a further federal prosecution and a number of cases under the illegal search and seizure doctrine where state officials had cooperated with the federal officials (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="4871.368" offset="19588890">Now we find ourselves in an anomalous position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4874.909" offset="19602996">If my clients have no benefit for the fifth amendment, it's just a question for them to determine whether they want to go to the state penitentiary for committing perjury from Louisiana or whether they want to go serve ten days in jail or whether they want to elect to be put in the federal penitentiary at Atlanta by admitting certain violations if for that testimony would be excluded under subsequent prosecution against my clients, but my clients still would have to serve ten days in jail or perhaps be subject to repeated rules for contempt for further refusals to answer the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4911.052" offset="19747610">Thank you Honors very much.</text>
