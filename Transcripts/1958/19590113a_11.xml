            <label>Mr. Sidney M. Glazer</label>
            <text syncTime="11.346" offset="148773">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.559" offset="157654">This is also a multiple punishment narcotic case.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.200" offset="180224">Unlike Blockburger, Gore and Greene, this case does not involve any sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.105" offset="207809">Also unlike Blockburger, Gore and Greene, this case does not involve the order form statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.601" offset="241768">The only statutes involved in this case are the Stamp Act requirement statute and the illegal import statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.178" offset="288057">The question, primary question for consideration is whether under a charge of purchasing narcotic drugs from an unstamped package, and receiving and concealing the same drugs, known that the drugs have been illegally imported, a defendant may be given consecutive sentences under proof of mere possession and under instructions which do not try to distinguish the elements of one statute from the elements in the other statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.125" offset="459839">Now, Section 4704 of Title 26 not only makes sale an offense, it makes purchase, sale, dispensing and distributing drugs, except in original stamped packages, a crime and that statute has a presumption which provides that the absence of stamps is prima facie evidence of a violation by the person in whose possession the narcotic drug may be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.306" offset="616573">The other statute involved is the import statute which makes it a crime to either import or receive, conceal, buy, sell, or in any manner facilitate the transportation, concealment or sale of narcotic drugs after import knowing that the drugs have been illegally imported.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.962" offset="715212">Again, there is a presumption which provides that possession of the narcotic drugs shall be sufficient evidence to constitute a -- a conviction of a violation of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.107" offset="783757">Now, in this particular case, the defendant received the maximum sentence in each -- on each of the two counts, or at that -- at that time, the maximum sentence was five years and so he received a consecutive sentence of 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.269" offset="856482">Now, the Government's case, the evidence in the Government's case show that there were two police officers standing on cans peered into windows of an apartment and they saw three individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.624" offset="925863">One police officer testified that he saw the two codefendants, not the -- not the petitioner handling some powder.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.901" offset="966928">The other officer testified that the -- he saw the defendant with something in his hand, but he did know what it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.395" offset="1004962">The officers announced who they were and all three occupants of the room fled and the officers found filled and unfilled capsules of narcotic drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.307" offset="1056580">They found some capsules in a woman's coat.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.715" offset="1074239">They found narcotic power on the mirror and --and they also found a needle and syringe.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.831" offset="1106735">Now, in this particular case, the defense in this case, this petitioner was in alibi that he wasn't there at the time and place the crime was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.781" offset="1158457">Somebody else testified that he, not petitioner was in the room and this alibi naturally was rejected by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.243" offset="1208299">Now, the instructions are very important in this case and they are set out on -- the pertinent instructions are set out on page 7, 8 and 9 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.350" offset="1276740">In this particular case, the Court instructed the jury by first reading the statutes involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.668" offset="1310072">They next instructed the jury by reading the presumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.717" offset="1326268">He then read each count of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.010" offset="1335463">Then the Court immediately after reading each count of the indictment said, “So, the question under each count of this indictment resolves down to whether or not the defendants or either of them did possess this narcotic drug on the 8th day of February, of this year, out there in the room at 4567 McMillan.”</text>
            <text syncTime="329.447" offset="1421145">Then the Court stated that under Count 1 that possession was prima facie evidence and significantly, the Court said, this is on page 8 of our brief, “So if you find and believe from all the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants or either of them possessed the narcotics mentioned in Count 1 and that the said narcotics did not bear the required internal revenue tax stamps, then you will find the defendants or either of them guilty as charged in Count 1.”</text>
            <text syncTime="364.681" offset="1562102">Then the Court gave a similar instruction under -- for Count 2, the difference being instead of saying that you will find the defendants guilty, the Court said that possession would authorize -- would authorize the conviction of the defendants under Count 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.731" offset="1630333">Then the Court went on to say that unless you find that the defendants had possession, that you must acquit the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.326" offset="1672652">Now, the Court of Appeals affirmed on a theory that the single act of possession justified cumulative sentence -- sentences and that the Court instructed the -- trial court instructed the jury as to the necessary elements required for a -- for a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.028" offset="1767528">Now, the first problem involved is, what did the Blockburger and Gore cases hold?</text>
            <text syncTime="425.557" offset="1805563">In Blockburger, there was a sale involving -- and Blockburger was charged under the order form statute and the stamp package statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.917" offset="1855091">The order forms statute doesn't have any presumption, so Blockburger did not have that issue as to whether or not you could get cumulative punishments from this substantially similar presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.626" offset="1913919">The Gore case, one count involved the order form, that's not -- that statute isn't involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.102" offset="1951744">The other two counts in Gore, Gore was charged with the purchase, sale and distribution of narcotic drugs from unstamped package in one of the other counts, and in the last count he was charged with transport -- transporting and concealing illegally imported drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.889" offset="2042964">The evidence in the Gore case show that Gore delivered narcotic drugs to a government agent in an unstamped package without any of the use of any order form.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.918" offset="2111091">So, the Gore case really didn't involve the question whether or not there was a conviction on both presumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.568" offset="2153618">Now, these presumptions have been said to place on the defendant, the duty of going forward with the evidence and their vice consist in the fact that different offenses may be presumed in an essence from the same fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.597" offset="2269811">In other words should you find -- if the jury finds that the defendant had possession of the drugs, then the burden of furnishing an explanation shifts to the defendant and if he doesn't furnish a satisfactory explanation, he can receive, according to the court below, cumulative sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.187" offset="2380152">Now, the Blockburger test which was referred to in the preceding argument, we don't believe, would require the imposition of cumulative sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.441" offset="2437099">And under that test, the test is whether each provision requires proofs -- proof of -- of an additional fact which the other does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.647" offset="2486000">Well, here, Congress itself has said, by these presumption statutes that different proof isn't required.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.451" offset="2529155">We don't have a situation where Congress hasn't spoken as to what the proof is, but here Congress in the very statute, in the very statutes in which it creates the crime, sets out what proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.291" offset="2588505">In effect, Congress has made possession the crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="653.529" offset="2717445">Well, if -- if all the -- if the extra proof was an unstamped package, I don't think there should be a multiple sentence for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.128" offset="2751927">In -- the original narcotics statute was the import statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="670.747" offset="2786408">The next statute was the Harrison Act and originally, the Harrison -- Harrison Act, that imposed the order form statute and there -- there was also a registration requirement.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="692.375" offset="2872822">But you're going all over Gore again.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.578" offset="2881703">We've disposed with all that in court.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="696.506" stopTime="889.250">
            <label>Mr. Sidney M. Glazer</label>
            <text syncTime="696.506" offset="2889435">No, Your Honor, I'm -- I don't mean to go back over Gore.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.222" offset="2904273">I -- I just want to refer to the reason for enacting the presumption in the Stamp Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.174" offset="2940113">The reason for enacting that presumption in the Stamp Act was to be sure the possessor should be punished.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.536" offset="2981491">Also as a matter of fact it's impossible for anybody in one sense, the tax is imposed upon all narcotics drugs, and tax has to be evidenced by the stamp.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.209" offset="3048260">And it's impossible to import any -- any narcotic drugs for the purpose of making heroin out of it, so from one point of view all narcotic drugs, all heroin, at least, would be unstamped.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.235" offset="3108342">Now, I think you have a different situation if -- if there was a purchase involved in -- in the two counts, if one count had a -- if -- if there was an -- if evidence -- there was actual evidence of a purchase, then it may be that you could impose consecutive sentences, because the -- there would be a little difference between the two charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.468" offset="3209279">In other words, the evidence would be a little different, but in the absence of -- of some evidence of a -- of a purchase, I don't think this -- this whole business of presumptions set forth in time, all are -- are based on the question whether or not something logically followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.802" offset="3286601">These presumptions and the whole theory of shifting the burden, the prayer or the reason for that rule is to convict a defendant where it's very difficult or impossible for the Government to obtain the necessary evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.380" offset="3348877">Now, I think it may be reasonable to assume that a person in possession has violated one -- one narcotic statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.118" offset="3391822">But just because a man has possession doesn't necessarily mean he was a purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.707" offset="3410213">For example, in this particular case, there were three people in the room.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.946" offset="3423169">Now, it all -- it may be that one person purchased the narcotic drugs and the other two didn't come into the picture until after the purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.089" offset="3467682">In other words, they didn't aid and abet the purchase, but their -- but their function may have been to assist in the disposition of the narcotic drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.156" offset="3499969">So, actually, the presumption, as applied in that case, in effect, is they are convicting -- convicting a man of -- of an extra crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.816" offset="3538631">A crime which doesn't -- which I don't think logically follows and -- and which, I don't see the reason when you're basing this thing on a presumption to have two sort of substantially similar presumptions, when the whole purpose of the presumption is to apply to a situation where you do not know what the wrong is and you say, “Well, the man has done some wrong in connection with the narcotic law.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.442" offset="3637164">If he can't come forward with -- with an explanation he should be punished.</text>

            <text syncTime="936.054" offset="3847607">In other words, at the time of the sale, there was an actual delivery of narcotic drug in an unstamped package.</text>
