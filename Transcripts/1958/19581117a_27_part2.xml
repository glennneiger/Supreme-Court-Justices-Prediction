            <text syncTime="18.464" offset="177194">It is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.683" offset="182105">The record shows that one third, the weight of 100 milligrams that is which is roughly one third of the weight of an ordinary five grain aspirin tablet.</text>

            <text syncTime="33.458" offset="237171">And the Secretary in denying the motion to reopen based part of his refusal on the fact that Red 32 had been involved in a -- an acute episode of poisoning from a single food.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.210" offset="288162">A 196 children and adults have been poisoned from one single food popcorn containing between 3000 and 9800 parts per million of Red 32 which established that if the corn was not restricted and used, certainly it had the potential of causing serious consequences if left unregulated in the dark.</text>

            <text syncTime="82.994" offset="435388">There's no -- the -- there's no legal restriction against this being used on popcorn except the judgment on the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.572" offset="469661">Now, the Secretary's order would have taken it out of all foods, drugs and cosmetics.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.927" offset="491081">Now, it's now in oranges and in any other food in which it's economically needed as a -- as a necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.526" offset="537475">Now, the toxicologist who testified in this case drew a distinction between Red 32 and salt.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.827" offset="558686">He recognized that salt maybe of use and that some consequences could flow from 3 or 4 ounces of salt taken at one term.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.061" offset="595571">But he also drew a comparison with carbolic acid.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.259" offset="612394">He testified that on a chronic basis, that is a long term use of a small amount of Red 32 or carbolic acid everyday in the diet, Red 32 was substantially more toxic than carbolic acid.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.214" offset="676237">Now, my opponent's implied to the Court that the amounts tested in the new scientific work between 1951 and 1953 were massively higher than what had already been tested back in the early 1940s.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.019" offset="731408">That is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.113" offset="735796">The exhibit is set forth in full beginning on page 239 of the record and it shows the various levels fed to the entire series of animals.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.418" offset="781040">What actually happened, the toxicologist started off with 2% in the diet, killed all of the rats within a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.411" offset="809044">He then went down to 1%, killed them all within two weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.389" offset="824926">He went down to a half percent, killed them all in 21 days and went on down to where he was at one tenth of a percent of the diet, which is the lowest level fed for the animals to survive any period of time to allow for an evaluation of toxic potential.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.816" offset="890650">Now, the record also shows that the rats which had 1000 parts per million or a tenth of 1% of the diet had a heart damage where there was no heart damage to the animals fed in somewhat higher level.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.306" offset="940596">And the pathologist himself remarked on the fact that this showed the significance of long term exposure to a toxic substance of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.927" offset="979048">We are concerned here not so much with whether a man is going to drop dead tomorrow from eating three or four oranges or 2500 oranges.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.498" offset="1013321">We don't expect man to eat 2500 oranges per day, but we do expect that he'd be not exposed to the insidious effects of a small amount of a known poison in his diet over his lifetime.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.665" offset="1070059">That the very least that should be required is a positive showing that no possibility of harm can come to him.</text>
