            <text syncTime="1549.938" offset="6303117">And that is that Section 9 (c) of the Act is mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.202" offset="6316178">I've indicated how the language was changed in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.585" offset="6329762">The "mays" in 9 (c) were changed to “shall”, and I've indicated that if the Board has found a commerce impact in the case, it has no discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.673" offset="6378036">The Board will argue that -- that the history of the Act doesn't support the language, but that's quite a novel theory that the history must support the language.</text>

            <text syncTime="1640.237" offset="6664338">I think at the outset I should make clear, perhaps it hasn't been made clear, and as for the Chief Justice's question that the Board throughout its 23-year history has not asserted its statutory power over hotels in the several States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.629" offset="6733928">Now, I think it is not entirely without significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.006" offset="6755349">As Mr. Brown has already indicated, that four years before the Board decided the case, which is now before this Court, the International Union, which is the petitioner here, appeared before the Board and at that time, the International defended the policy which it so vigorously attacks today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.520" offset="6833403">Indeed, I might say that I for one is tempted to read -- to answer the arguments that's been made here today by simply reading excerpts from the argument that was made by petitioner's counsel before the Board at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.468" offset="6905292">Now, at that time, petitioner argued before the Board that this was a long-standing policy which had received the approval, the endorsement, not only of the union, the largestunion in this field, but as of management as well and of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.703" offset="6970180">Secondly, it urged the Board not to depart from this policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.273" offset="6984495">And finally, it warned the Board they would be making a serious mistake if it departed from this policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.547" offset="7009573">Now, it may well be that the wisdom of the Board's policy may be open to argument, but I suggest, Your Honors, that the pendulum has not swung so far that this policy which the union so strongly endorsed has now become arbitrary, capricious and -- and beyond the Board's policy to adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.296" offset="7104554">Now, let me explore -- let me explore the basis of this change -- change of attitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.634" offset="7129945">Initially, it is argued that the Board does not have the power to decline, would assert jurisdiction on representation cases such as this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.374" offset="7172890">Of course, this argument goes beyond a hotel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.329" offset="7184697">It covers everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.525" offset="7193475">And if this argument is valid, then, of course, all of the Board's jurisdictional window through all the Board's jurisdictional standards, its administrative criteria for exercising this legal jurisdiction are knocked out, insofar as representation cases are involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1802.526" offset="7313429">Now, if I may by way of anticipation of my argument, I do not believe that the decision of this Court stands for the proposition that the Board may never exclude a group of employers as a class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.706" offset="7374242">What I think that decision stands for is that in that particular case, the reason which the Board had given for excluding labor organizations as -- when acting as employers for excluding them as a class, that those reasons were without rational basis and both the majority and the concurring opinion agreed on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.856" offset="7446758">But -- and then the second part was that the express inclusion of unions within the -- within the definition of the term employer in the statute plus the legislative history, be it -- be behind that -- behind that precluded the Board from adopting a standard with respect -- with respect to the labor organizations when acting as employers, which would exclude all of them.I suggest, Your Honors, that the teaching of that decision, the significance of that decision is that the critical factor is not whether the Board has excluded a group of employers as a class, but rather the critical factor is whether the considerations, which underlies such a policy are rational and within the Board's competence to make.</text>

            <text syncTime="2506.018" offset="10127444">The underlying theory of the statute, I think, makes evidences a congressional purpose not to require the Board to assert its jurisdiction to the hilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.336" offset="10164746">I'm not going to go into the legislative history because I haven't got the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.562" offset="10177599">We've set it forth in our -- we've set it forth in our -- our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.004" offset="10191391">Congress has repeatedly looked into the Board's policies with respect to decline to assert its statutory jurisdiction to the hilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.809" offset="10218559">Between 1948 and 1950, at least three different congressional committees looked into this problem and they did nothing about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.036" offset="10247502">Now, the argument is made that -- that Section 9, Section 9 of the statute, unlike Section 10 which deals with -- which deals with unfair labor practices and Section 9 which deals with representation cases is phrased in mandatory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.424" offset="10313017">Now, you -- and that because it's phrased in mandatory language, the Board cannot decline to process representation and petitions unless they are of a de minimis character.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.154" offset="10360038">Now, there are several answers to this contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.279" offset="10376443">In the first place, one would have supposed that in the face of the Board's 23-year history of declining to assert jurisdiction to the hilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.163" offset="10412074">Its legal power to the hilt whether over representation cases or unfair labor practices, one would have supposed that in the face of that history, there would be some mention of this problem in connection with Section 9 that Congress intended to change that policy and yet, there is not a word about it in either the legislative debates or the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.406" offset="10481037">Secondly, it would be something of an anomaly to force the Board to assert its jurisdiction to the hilt in representation cases, and yet permit the Board, and petitioner acknowledges the Board has this power and yet permit the Board to decline to assert its jurisdiction to the hilt and the unfair labor practices which looks to the enforcement of the certification.</text>

            <text syncTime="2649.551" offset="10701615">Looking at it in that light, I think that there is an explanation of why Congress changed it from “may” in the Wagner Act to “shall”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.805" offset="10730559">And the explanation, I believe, lies in this Court's decision in the Inland Empire case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.294" offset="10752502">In that case, which was decided in 1945, the problem came up whether the Board could hold a representation hearing, which, of course, is part of the investigation after the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.377" offset="10808926">The Board did that for reasons I won't go into at the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.056" offset="10819584">It held an election and then subsequently held a -- the hearing with respect to the contentions of the parties as to units and what have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.624" offset="10857827">This Court -- this Court said that the statute did not require the Board to hold the representation hearing prior to the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.994" offset="10891368">Indeed, the statute didn't require the Board to hold an election at all, that the Board could determine whether a union was a representative of a particular group of employees on the basis of something other than an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.042" offset="10939538">Now, I think, although I cannot point to any legislative history that supports this, my -- my own -- my own notion is that the language of the statute was designed to meet that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.541" offset="10985514">In other words, it was designed to make the Board hold a representation hearing prior to the election and it was also designed to preclude the Board from certifying a union except on the basis of -- of an election.</text>

            <text syncTime="2821.639" offset="11389889">They were not thinking of Section 9 if that was a test in permissive terms and it is my own -- my own view -- my own view that what Congress was concerned here was to make clear what Section 9 had not made -- had either not made clear or simply was the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.186" offset="11468152">And namely, that they want to make sure that the Board would hold an election prior to or -- or to conduct the investigation including the representation hearing prior to the -- to the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.028" offset="11511515">And secondly, that the Board could not issue a formal certificate as it had been doing under the Wagner Act on the basis of -- of cards that it would have to issue a certification solely on the basis of a Board election.</text>

            <text syncTime="3333.176" offset="13436113">Indeed -- indeed, representatives of both labor and management in 1948 appeared before Congress when the Board's then general counsel indicated that he was going to assert the statutory jurisdiction of the Board to the hilt and issue complaints involving hotels.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.489" offset="13501315">Representatives of both this union and of management went before Congress and strangely opposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.656" offset="13522004">Then it changed in the Board's policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.959" offset="13531199">And indeed, in 1951, they came before the Board itself and are advanced in support of the Board's policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.350" offset="13556799">All the arguments which I am making today in support of that policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3370.098" offset="13583757">Now, finally -- finally, I think there is cogent evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.053" offset="13599535">There is cogent evidence of the legislative proof of the Board's policy and let me mention those very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.862" offset="13626807">In 1947, when Congress was considering to amend -- to Taft-Hartley, the suggestion was made that the Board's policy had left it in doubt as to whether hotels came within the Board jurisdiction or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.595" offset="13673723">And the suggestion was made that an amendment be passed, which in effect would require the Board to depart from its policy and to assert jurisdiction over hotels.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.810" offset="13710608">Nothing came of that proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.762" offset="13718444">Second -- secondly, in 1940 -- in 1948 -- in 1948, when the Board's then general counsel, as I said a moment ago, indicated a purpose to assert the Board's jurisdiction to the hilt in the issuance of complaints, both representatives of management and of the union went before a congressional committee and opposed to any of the parts from the Board's policy and the upshot of that was at that committee approved to the Board's policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.485" offset="13833279">Again, in 1949, Senator Taft, it's true that this comes after -- after the Act was passed and I think we cannot minimize -- we cannot minimize the views of a man like Senator Taft on this piece of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.821" offset="13882702">In 1949, Senator Taft, in answer to a specific question put to him on the floor, the Senate not only implicitly approved the Board's policy, but went even so far as to say, and while we ourself don't take the position, but it's indicative of this, approved of Board's policy, he went so far as to say that he didn't think that the hotels were intended to be covered by this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.015" offset="13963473">Now, more recently -- more recently in 1955, as a result of the difficulty that the union has been experiencing in Florida which have been brought to this Court, in the case that was argued before this one, Senator Lehman introduced a bill which would in effect have required the Board to assert it's jurisdiction over hotels.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.666" offset="14038079">Nothing came of that either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.358" offset="14044766">Now, taking all of these factors into account, we believe that the judgement which the Board has made here is a permissible one which lies within its competence to make.</text>
