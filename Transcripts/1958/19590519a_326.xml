            <text syncTime="35.735" offset="246262">We are hereby in certiorari to the Ninth Circuit which affirmed a judgment of the Territorial Supreme Court of Hawaii suspending petitioner, a lawyer, from the practice of law for a period of one year, by virtue of the rules of the local court that suspension is tantamount to disbarment because she cannot get back without taking another examination and passing the character test and I quote from the rule, "As an applicant for admission".</text>
            <text syncTime="69.652" offset="381994">The conduct upon which the matter was tried in the Territorial Court involved two incidents, one was a public speech given in a little hamlet called Honokaa over on the Island of Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.583" offset="445733">And the second was a series of interviews of a trial juror after the case in which that juror had served -- had closed and the jury had been dismissed.</text>

            <label>Mr. John T. McTernan</label>
            <text syncTime="125.425" offset="605080">This juror had served 10 months, Your Honor, in one case and he was dismissed for good.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.510" offset="633396">We contend that the findings with reference to the Honokaa speech are arbitrary and that the discipline imposed upon her involves an infringement of her rights under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.094" offset="691702">She was found to have impugned the integrity of the trial judge in the remarks that where attributed to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.589" offset="721690">Before getting into the details of our argument on that, let me just give you this much background.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.012" offset="747395">Counsel and her firm -- I mean petitioner and her firm were counsel for the ILWU, the dominant labor force in the island.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.655" offset="785951">And the regional director of that organization along with six others was indicted for conspiracy to violate the Smith Act in a case called United States against Fujimoto.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.511" offset="833390">Petitioner was a counsel of record in that case and had been from a day or two after the indictment had been returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.829" offset="866722">She was counsel for this regional director whose name was Jack Hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.154" offset="888038">The trial had been under way for approximately six weeks at the time of the speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.638" offset="909876">And during those six weeks, the Court had her testimony from a witness named Paul Crouch, one of the three perjurious witnesses referred to in an opinion of this Court in Communist Party against SACB.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.662" offset="965987">This man had told a story about galloping over the Russian steppes in 1927 at a time when defendant in the Fujimoto case, Jack Hall, was 14 years old and another defendant was four years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.183" offset="1024084">And there had been a series of objections and motions to strike with reference to that testimony, and the testimony had been admitted subject to connection and subject to later a motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.349" offset="1080717">They had also been contentions made to the Court in Fujimoto that the trial should not be held because of the adverse climate of public opinion and similar matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.874" offset="1126902">Now, the union had set out a defense committee which was doing the job of raising money for the defense, Jack Hall and other people who might be caught in the then political prosecutions that where going on both in Hawaii and elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.611" offset="1205791">And this Committee called the Union Defense Committee sponsored the meeting at Honokaa at which petitioner gave her speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.153" offset="1244035">And it says in the record that this was kind of rapport back to this -- this union membership and some of their friends from the public who attended this meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.367" offset="1316864">It should be pointed out that -- as I think I've indicated already, that Honokaa is a small rural hamlet over on another island about 182 air miles from Hawaii over open ocean.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.978" offset="1363257">It's a little town in the rural section there, the sugar plantation area.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.177" offset="1388126">Now, we -- as I say, we attacked the findings that in this speech, petitioner impugned the integrity of the trial judge as arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.453" offset="1445177">The issue obviously is from the finding of the Court, and that will be found at page 117 of the record or rather at page 118, the paragraph beginning at the top of -- the continued paragraph at the top of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.468" offset="1525217">Issue is, did the language, which he used, impugn the integrity of Judge Wiig?</text>
            <text syncTime="361.777" offset="1550503">Now, we concede at the outset, because much of it has made of this in appellant's brief, that this speech was largely all then concerning the Fujimoto trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.654" offset="1590000">Indeed, the speech was critical of the conduct of the Fujimoto trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.162" offset="1607973">And in one or two passages, it may reasonably be said that petitioner was critical of Judge Wiig.</text>

            <text syncTime="410.100" offset="1743809">And as I recall the Fujimoto record, the evidence of this man, Crouch, was put on, remote as it was, back in 1927, speaking as of that date, to show the nature of the Communist Party and then apparently, the -- the burden still remained upon the Government to connect this up with the particular defendants who were standing trial there.</text>

            <text syncTime="553.116" offset="2315786">There was no casting of any reflection upon his honesty, no charge of corruption or political motivation or abuse of power or willful partiality nor is there any evidence of direct and explicit attack upon the District Court or upon the judiciary generally.</text>

            <text syncTime="585.837" offset="2446712">Then in a conspiracy case like Fujimoto, the prosecution is predicated upon an alleged agreement to do something not the actual doing of it that in a conspiracy case there is -- like Fujimoto, there is great latitude in the receipt of evidence of third party declarations and third party conduct, that this latitude was necessary for the Government to make its case, and that the Government was constantly pressing for greater latitude in these respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.209" offset="2568234">And these characteristics of Fujimoto are not found in prosecutions for the substantive offense and they raise grave questions of vicarious guilt and finally, the thesis that the Government's pretrial propaganda in the FBI methods of recruiting witnesses had cast a -- a heavy cloud of unfairness upon the trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1284.613" offset="5241814">But I submit that this compares the operation of the hearsay rule and the substantive offense cases as against the operation of the hearsay rule and the conspiracy cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1414.714" offset="5762278">And his city editor then asked him to type up his notes which he did in a slightly expanded form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.162" offset="5796028">Now, he says the slightly expanded form means that he was spelling out ellipses which crept in to his handwriting when he was writing in a hurry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.895" offset="5835003">I do think, however, that the notes have a certain post litem motam quality about them and in any event, they are not verbatim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.546" offset="5881605">Incidentally, the original note that was testified, they were turned over to the FBI when it conducted an investigation which Judge Wiig ordered, and the original notes were never produced in the hearing and the FBI certified that it couldn't find them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.284" offset="5948479">These notes which are in evidence then are sort of two steps removed from the original event having been put together after the to do was (Inaudible) in court, they are not verbatim and they were -- reflect a layman's understanding of fairly complex legal subject matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1533.646" offset="6237915">Now, we get down to those notes themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.211" offset="6252231">The core of respondent's case turns on four sentences which it is taken out of context, out of a 30-minute speech and hatch together as if they where a single excerpt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.027" offset="6327463">If the Court will follow me on page 577 of the record, we find that the first paragraph breaks the words “There is no such thing as a fair trial in a Smith Act case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.404" offset="6401024">All rules of evidence have to be scrapped or the Government can make a case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.359" offset="6424848">Then we go down what represents the page in the original document to another paragraph that says, “There is no fair trial in the case, they just make up the rules as they go along.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.326" offset="6480645">Now, those four sentences do not belong together, they are separated by important contextual material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.453" offset="6521187">They are preceded and they are followed by important contextual material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.595" offset="6541772">Let's take the first sentence, “There is no such thing as a fair trial in a Smith Act case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.875" offset="6558908">The whole page of the notes preceding that deals with what the -- the notes refer to as a barrage of Government propaganda carried on by the Government prior to this trial making the climate of public opinion unfair to these defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.291" offset="6624528">It talks about FBI tactics in recruiting and coercing witnesses not only the service witnesses but to say what the Government once said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.592" offset="6661726">It seems to me, if the Court please, that this constitutes a rational explanation of her statement, “There is no fair trial in a Smith Act case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.301" offset="6696626">And it doesn't -- and it, at least, is rational as -- saying that she is charging Judge Wiig with deliberately and perhaps dishonestly causing the trial to be unfair.</text>

            <text syncTime="1812.316" offset="7352613">But I -- it presents a problem which the case at least suggest if it doesn't actually raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.594" offset="7369749">I -- I think this, Mr. Justice Stewart, that -- that there are two categories of limitations on the lawyer's right of free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.034" offset="7403499">I think that he operates under the same restriction or lay down or indicated in Bridges, Pennekamp and Craig as applicable to laymen as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.720" offset="7442265">I think that in addition, he must -- he must not indulge in speech which causes loss of public respect and confidence in the court, the so-called Canon 1 offense that we referred to the -- the Code of Ethics prescribed by the American Bar Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.861" offset="7522826">There is another canon that might be involved, Canon 20 which is actually a fair administration of justice situation, the so-called leaking of essential information to the newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.857" offset="7566817">Now, so far as I can find in -- in my research and we've given a considerable attention to this and we wrote our brief in such a way that -- to challenge our adversary to find authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.759" offset="7610389">We could find no authorities which say that the limitations imposed upon the lawyer are any greater than this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.566" offset="7641631">Now, I recognize that in weighing all the factors in either one of those situations, there would be additional factors operating where the lawyer's speeches involved on the fair administration of justice cases for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.548" offset="7697533">It would mean a lot more in the public principles, the lawyer in the case to say that the witness testifying on the stand is a lair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.208" offset="7732224">And that we're prepared to show that he has committed to all kinds of public events and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.776" offset="7758451">But I -- I think that we have essentially the same question of law although, the -- the questions of fact could be weighed would be somewhat difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.660" offset="7790007">So also, in the -- in the public respect and confidence in the Court, the case has recognized and when a lawyer speaks, casting reflections upon a judge or upon a court, his words weigh more than those of the laymen's.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.566" offset="7841625">But again, we're dealing with the -- the same question of law that is slightly different questions of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.805" offset="7886555">Now, getting back to this -- to this analysis of the evidence because I think context is all important here with reference to that first sentence about no such thing is a fair trial in a Smith Act case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.278" offset="7932531">Let me suggest also that the paragraphing in those notes is of significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.127" offset="7959907">If the -- the statement, “There is no such thing as a fair trial on a Smith Act case” were written in Matsuoka's notes as a part of the paragraphs that preceded it, its relationship to that context and the meaning it gets from it would be considerably different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.000" offset="8015391">And this paragraphing is Matsuoka's paragraphing not petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.349" offset="8032737">Now, we come to the second sentence, “All rules of evidence have to be scrapped or the Government can make a case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.831" offset="8058650">Incidentally, the court below did not find that that remark had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.584" offset="8081742">But in any event, the context that follows shows that what she was talking about was the disuse, if you will, of the hearsay rule in conspiracy cases as compared with substantive offense cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.514" offset="8145377">And therefore, I think that while this may have been in exact language, it may have been fully chosen language, what she was saying is that the conspiracy technique results in depriving people of the protection of the hearsay rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.897" offset="8210996">And if you go back early in the speech, you'll find that this is the theme that she's struck in various forms through out the speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.769" offset="8246418">Now, we go down to the next two sentences, “There's no fair trial in the case, they just make up the rules as they go along.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.103" offset="8275780">The context which precedes that, that which I have discussed and the context which follows it again refers to the hearsay rule in the conspiracy cases and also to the problem of remoteness and the Government's pressure in these Smith Act cases to enlarge this scope particularly with reference to remote evidence from case to case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.322" offset="8384658">And this again strikes the theme struck earlier with reference to Crouch in Russia in 1927 when Paul was 13 and Fujimoto was four.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.487" offset="8425305">It also, it seems to me, indicates or finds support from or my reading of evidence in this respect finds support in the testimony of one of the witnesses, he was a labor relations manager for one of the plantations who said that the way he understood the significance of the speech, he had tied in to any Smith Act case whether in New York or Honolulu or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.329" offset="8524675">Now, if the Court please, we get down by virtue of the treatment of the evidence in the court below to a pretty fine hair, that pronoun “they”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.691" offset="8570128">The court below, if you'll look at page 561, in setting forth its findings as to what she said puts -- as to paragraph 3, puts the pronoun “they” in quotation mark.</text>

            <text syncTime="2164.253" offset="8760404">The context about making up the rules as they go along is one in which he is talking about the pressure of government lawyers in successive Smith Act cases to expand the limits of remoteness in the -- in the receipt of evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2192.902" offset="8875029">But even more, if the Court please, let us look at the testimony of the witnesses who dealt with this remark.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.500" offset="8897390">And these were the witnesses now whose testimony was focused just on the remark and not on the context as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.478" offset="8925288">Six witnesses dealt with this remark in their testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.019" offset="8939499">Four of them said that the subject of the sentence about scrapping the rules was government, and two of them said “they”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.015" offset="8975444">And I submit that respondent's position and the position of the court below that “they” equals Judge Wiig is bad grammar torn out of context, contrary to the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.450" offset="9037197">Now, respondent's case next rest upon an excerpt which appears on the same page 577, the next paragraph which reads, “Unless we stop this mistrial trial in its tracks here, there will be a new crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.006" offset="9099368">People will be charged with knowing what is included in books' idea.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.089" offset="9123715">Now, I think that the meaning of this is perfectly obvious that what she was saying is that Smith Act prosecutions continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.908" offset="9147016">We're going to define as a crime of reading books and having ideas.</text>

            <text syncTime="2268.533" offset="9177527">And as a matter of fact, I don't think that's too remote from the conclusion to which these courts reach in the Yates case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.499" offset="9201351">But in any event, I think that it -- this is the only reasonable, rational conclusion that can be drawn from the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.285" offset="9236564">And I think that respondent's construction of it is utterly tortured and unsound.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.671" offset="9262059">They say that this sentence means or these two sentences mean that Judge Wiig's conduct of the trial was a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.574" offset="9301661">Now, the only way, if the Court please, that that construction could possibly be supported.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.226" offset="9324231">It's in the excerpt with the words “unless we stop the Smith trial in its tracks here, there will be a new crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.671" offset="9350040">And that's cropping the evidence, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.650" offset="9365922">Somewhat similar to the irresponsible cropping of the evidence that is conducted by a certain late senator in a hearing conducted across the street a few years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.148" offset="9412002">This evidence, if the Court please, does not rationally justify the finding that petitioner impugned Judge Wiig's integrity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.049" offset="9447528">Neither the lower court in its opinion nor the Territorial Court in its opinion attempted to examine these remarks in context or try to ascertain precisely what petitioner said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.008" offset="9503431">Neither evaluated the remarks in the context of the trial in which she was speaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.455" offset="9533210">Those courts and especially respondent here gloss on to the remarks, words and ideas which are not found in the evidence and which are contrary to the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.836" offset="9574693">And if I may pick out what I think is a -- an agriedous example of this, I refer the Court to pages 57 and 58 of respondent's brief, where these very words, not put in quotes, are treated this way, right from the bottom of page 57 that there could be no fair trial in the Smith Act case because all of the rules of evidence have to be scrapped so the Government can make its case and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.665" offset="9690049">Now, there is nothing in the evidence from which the word “because” can reasonably be interpolated in to her remark.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.221" offset="9720247">It's not there in the Matsuoka notes, it's not there in the testimony of the witnesses and it's contrary to the context in which she made the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.854" offset="9754833">There is nothing in the evidence which says or attributes to her the remark that the scrapping of the rules was so, that is for the purpose of enabling the Government to make its case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.313" offset="9800600">And it's simply a -- a matter of interpretation by interpolation, if you will, which constitutes, it seems to me, an evidentiary force.It's just not there and it -- and it doesn't belong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.888" offset="9882937">I submit that here, the burden upon petitioners' accuses was to establish the charges by clear and convincing evidence, the charge that she had impugned the integrity of the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.193" offset="9932152">I submit that under the evidence here, the remarks are at best dubious as an attack upon integrity and in context there as an obvious and rational construction of them quite the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.597" offset="9985755">And I submit that the free speech aspect of this case alone require the acceptance of the rational explanation of her remarks when the evidence afford such (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.776" offset="10034448">Now, addressing myself to the First Amendment aspect of the case for the moment and again, we're dealing only with the Honokaa speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.830" offset="10070706">Central to the lower court's disposition of this aspect of the case were these two factors, first, that the speech was given during the pendency of the trial and secondly, by a lawyer of record in the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.829" offset="10122637">And our positions for reasons which I've indicated to Mr. Justice Stewart earlier are that these two considerations have no application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.428" offset="10161089">The value of public discussion during the course of the trial has been pretty well spelled out by this Court in the Bridges, Pennekamp and Craig cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.916" offset="10195048">I would think that a lawyer, given his training and his ability to articulate and to expound, could be a particularly valuable contributor to public discussion when the discussion deals with law and the operation of law, law enforcement technique and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.402" offset="10269027">Now, I recognize that there are risks here, and I think Mr. Justice Frankfurter has already indicated them that what is done with the speech in public, in the public prints may resolve in their being some impact upon the fair administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.051" offset="10335587">But I think that this calls for an even nicer discrimination of the evidence, if the Court please.</text>
