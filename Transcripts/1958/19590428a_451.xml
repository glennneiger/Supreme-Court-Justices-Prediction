            <label>Mr. Edward M. Dangel</label>
            <text syncTime="17.324" offset="172701">-- may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.512" offset="185448">The petitioner here was tried upon an indictment that contained two counts, first count, for having transported in interstate commerce a check that was procured by fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.025" offset="251486">The second count, for a conspiracy between himself, one Meierdiercks, and an unknown person called Mr. Rice in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.622" offset="309896">He was found guilty after two trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.307" offset="332570">The first trial was reversed by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.509" offset="377396">The first trial was before the Jencks decision and before the so-called Jencks Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.043" offset="419506">The reversal by the Court of Appeals was based upon the fact that he was not given FBI material or statements reports, and was not provided with the grand jury minutes concerning two principal witnesses, one Meierdiercks and one Ms. Vossler, Ms. Vossler being the victim of the fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.193" offset="528175">The Jencks Act had not been passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.435" offset="549073">Then, he was tried again before the same judge after the Jencks Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.593" offset="581778">And during the trial, he was deprived of the material of which we now complain, FBI reports and some statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.975" offset="623261">And the Court of -- and the judge, I'll go into this much more fully later, claimed he was acting both under the Jencks Act and under the Jencks decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.184" offset="692120">The Court of Appeals confirmed the conviction and they acted under the Jencks Act and the Jencks decision, although they don't say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.213" offset="752201">The District Attorney or United States Attorney adheres strictly in his contentions to the Jencks Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.983" offset="787310">This Court granted certiorari on the grounds, first, whether the rule on the Jencks case was a rule of mere procedure or did it involve the defendant's constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.062" offset="859617">Then, again, whether or not a clear violation of the rule was harmless error, whether the conceded error of the trial court and the Court of Appeals found that there was -- there was error, error in withholding from counsel prior statements of a principal government witness could be excused by the Court of Appeals because it found that the defense was not hampered in cross-examination of those witnesses concerning material that's in a sealed envelope that's never been seen by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.647" offset="993991">And, another part of the certiorari is that it is proper for a Court of Appeals to determine what use defense counsel might have made of the statements erroneously withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.029" offset="1043519">The -- the case, when it came up for trial again and prior thereto, the defendant made two motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.709" offset="1114258">The third one, which is not too important for a continuance, the two motions were that he be allowed to inspect before trial the statements of Meierdiercks, who was the principal witness and Vossler, who was also a principal witness and who the judge knew, all the judges knew, had to be material witnesses or the Government had no case.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.259" offset="1236407">It was first presented to the assignment judge whose ruling was that, because of the Jencks Act, he could not allow the motions at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.897" offset="1298996">The preposition being stated to him that it would delay the trial and interrupt the trial, and so forth, and a -- the judge said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.313" offset="1344658">He was bound to wait until the witness testified, although he knew and everybody else knew that those witnesses were bound to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.033" offset="1383528">However, he put a loophole in his ruling to this extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.000" offset="1403382">He said “you may renew this request again to the trial judge.”</text>
            <text syncTime="329.527" offset="1421458">And, the request was renewed to the trial judge who, as I say, was the same judge who tried the case first, and his remarks in the record show that he knows just what the Government needs because he said the Government cannot prove this case, unless Mr. Meierdiercks testifies.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.425" offset="1501080">They might leave out Ms. Vossler but I don't see how they could do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.133" offset="1519888">However, he denied the motion again not as a matter of discretion, as I read the record, but as a matter that he was bound to wait until the witness testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.892" offset="1586970">Now, at the trial, Mr. Meierdiercks was not only the main witness, but the only witness who implicates the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.162" offset="1635976">And, Mr. Meierdiercks, who himself was a confessed criminal in not only this particular activity but running many, many years with a long criminal career, had made statements to the FBI.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.059" offset="1723643">The first statement that he made was that he was in no way implicated in any wrong doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.987" offset="1767320">He then made another statement in which he again denied that he had done anything wrong or that he knew the petitioner Rosenberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.234" offset="1816325">Now, there were two interviews with Mr. Meierdiercks before he made a written statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.395" offset="1860942">Those two appear at the bottom of page 46 and they were not given to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.660" offset="1889991">I might say, at this point, that never did the Government asked the judge to edit any reports or material in its possession, although I believe that the Government's brief says that the judge could edit what had to be submitted to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.021" offset="1975463">I don't believe that Mr. Bechtle's objections were based upon anything except the fact that 3500 did not permit these papers to be given to the because they were not signed by Mr. Meierdiercks, they were not approved by him, they were not adopted by him, nor were they verbatim.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.768" offset="2070444">He rested on 3500.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.705" offset="2082147">Now, these two reports to the FBI agents are interviews with Mr. Meierdiercks but they were not given to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.127" offset="2127914">I believe they are in the sealed envelope.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.148" offset="2139930">This -- most of the material that I can tell you about appears in the Court of Appeals opinion at page 94.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.106" offset="2207848">Judge Hasty has, there, revealed the contents of these papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.156" offset="2240031">Now, what the judge did, he examined them himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.269" offset="2264482">He took charge and he examined them in camera.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.982" offset="2291336">He never allowed the defendant to know any of the contents and, in connection with Exhibits 5 and 6, he gave part of those exhibits, pages 2 and 4, I believe, of Exhibit 6 and certain parts of Exhibit 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.921" offset="2359045">That's C5 and C6, his own exhibit, the Court's exhibit, but he wouldn't show the rest and the rest, I believe, is also contained in the sealed envelope.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.152" offset="2407946">There are also two office memoranda of the FBI concerning the progress and procedure of a then-pending prosecution against Meierdiercks.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.459" offset="2445249">That's also page 95 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.862" offset="2478791">There's another paper which contains the detailed physical description and summary and personal history of Meierdiercks.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.721" offset="2506271">Still, another is a record of an unsuccessful search for certain names on hotel registers on or about the time of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.287" offset="2544515">The -- then, he says “these and other miscellaneous items from the prosecution's files were obviously not germane to the request of the defendant.”</text>
            <text syncTime="619.126" offset="2579832">Why the Prosecution produced them is not clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.666" offset="2594043">Their surrender could not have been responsive to the defense's request or to any proper request for whatever records the Government had, in verbatim text or otherwise, of prior statements of certain witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.963" offset="2643257">These were given to the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.678" offset="2658095">And then, he says there -- in addition, there was a minute or office notation, stating of fact that, on the first questioning, Meierdiercks had denied any involvement and any alleged wrong doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.578" offset="2705638">Then, there was a typewritten copy of a detailed statement of Meierdiercks about the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.385" offset="2728939">The Court of Appeals says there that the handwritten copy was the original.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.710" offset="2750255">How do we know that it was the original?</text>
            <text syncTime="664.924" offset="2763107">It is a -- it is Exhibit 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.317" offset="2772616">It's Court's Exhibit No. 2 or maybe Government's Exhibit No. 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.296" offset="2800515">It's a 10 or a 12-page handwritten statement which Meierdiercks testified -- it's C2, Court Exhibit 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.932" offset="2851088">Meierdiercks testified that, upon questioning by the FBI agent, the FBI agent wrote a lot of things and he was hesitant about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.672" offset="2906049">He wasn't cooperative, and then, he became cooperative, and the statement was finally presented to him and he signed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.240" offset="2936351">And, I saw it this morning in the Clerk's Office and is witnessed by two special agents of the FBI.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.154" offset="2968012">But, the typewritten --</text>

            <text syncTime="722.299" offset="2992567">That was not withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.831" offset="3002702">The thing that was withheld was the typewritten copy, and I've dared say that a skillful cross-examiner might have been able to show that the typewritten copy was the original and that the FBI agent's copy, the typewritten copy, and, from that, Mr. Meierdiercks attached his signature.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.941" offset="3095176">All I say is that, if the defendant was entitled to this material, he was entitled to make such use of it as might have been available to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.964" offset="3139271">That is to say, the record at page 96 says, as the Court of Appeals finds, that the handwritten one was the original.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.138" offset="3187963">Now, I don't know how the Court of Appeals reaches that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.251" offset="3200397">Certainly, they really -- the Court of Appeals reaches that conclusion without any statement from the defendant or without any evidence except as they look at the papers.</text>

            <label>Ms. Beatrice Rosenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="1784.736" offset="7242271">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.533" offset="7253556">The issue in this case is very much narrower than would appear because of what actually happened on this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.568" offset="7289605">Now, let me say just a -- one word about the fact because it, again, said the background of what happened here must be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.528" offset="7325445">This is a case which the Government's main witness, Meierdiercks, went to Ms. Vossler.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.738" offset="7366301">He testified, at the direction of petitioner and offered to buy her leases, certain oil leases that she had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.278" offset="7396498">In the meantime, according to Meierdierck, at the direction of petitioner, some other persons who was never identified also came and fitted up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.008" offset="7439444">So that, eventually, they agreed to about $35 an acre and, presumably, she was going to sell all her leases for $57,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.047" offset="7479568">Well, the subject came around discussion of her taxes, capital gains on that, and Meierdiercks said, “Well, if you give us 10% down now, cash, this can be handled as if it was profits of an oil company which has a deduction and, so, that will cut down your tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.832" offset="7566712">But, you must give us this 10% first before the sale.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.437" offset="7593148">As a result of that, Ms. Meierdiercks -- Meierdiercks and Ms. Vossler went to Philadelphia where she backed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.354" offset="7620838">She drew out a certified check for $5700 and gave it to Meierdiercks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.342" offset="7652707">Now, he testified that he, in turn, gave it to petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.054" offset="7667545">The petitioner went to Washington and bought some leases for -- he wasn't present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.615" offset="7705788">He testified that was the arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.597" offset="7713729">The petitioner bought the leases and -- for Ms. Vossler for $500 or $1000 and then got the balance of the certified check in cash, and then, part of that money was given to Meierdiercks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.453" offset="7773184">Now, Ms. Vossler testified as to her dealings with Meierdiercks, but she never saw petitioner.She never identified him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.617" offset="7821876">All that she could do was corroborate Meierdiercks as to her testimony -- as to his dealings with her.</text>

            <text syncTime="1939.108" offset="7859806">When you say corroborate, do you mean not to tell what were the durations that she had to find?</text>

            <label>Ms. Beatrice Rosenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="1945.520" offset="7885406">That's right, but they were corroborative of his version of what he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.990" offset="7899303">That's all I meant by that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.293" offset="7908498">Now, that was basically the picture and, at the first trial, the Court had examined Meierdiercks' grand jury testimony and statement to the FBI and had said there was one item that it thought significant to the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.517" offset="8001390">It didn't find anything else contradictory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.872" offset="8014869">That was before Jencks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.682" offset="8022079">It went up on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.101" offset="8027826">By that time, the Jencks decision had come down and the Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.826" offset="8046634">Then, this case came on for retrial at the time, as the statute had been passed, but there was this reversal of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.998" offset="8091355">When it came up, there was, the petitioner said, a pretrial demand which was denied on the ground that Jencks didn't require in the statute for a bad pretrial production.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.856" offset="8150810">The judge said that it was clear that Meierdiercks would be called.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.211" offset="8172231">That the Government, as he recalled, the case -- couldn't possibly have a case without it and, therefore, he would arrange to have both the grand jury minutes and the sworn statement of Meierdiercks turned over to the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.323" offset="8236701">At the conclusion of the first day of trial, which was not literally within the statute because Meierdiercks had not completed his direct testimony, but it was felt that, since he was such an important witness and known to be such, that would do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.531" offset="8309530">And, this was done, and then, what happened appears in the record at page 47, a little bit later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.036" offset="8367522">The defense attorney said “as I remember the first trial, Meierdiercks testified that he was interviewed several times by the FBI, but all the Government turned over to me is one signed statement.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.362" offset="8448815">And, the United States Attorney said “now, this is a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.161" offset="8468041">We do have reports of -- or summary of interviews in addition to the signed statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.569" offset="8525615">And, as we read the statute, the defense is not entitled to that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.617" offset="8545886">That was the United States Attorney's position, but what the Court said was “you had better turn them over to me and I will look at them, and I will decide whether I think the defense is entitled to them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.690" offset="8630105">At this point, you see, the United States Attorney had taken position that all he had to turn over was a signed statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.723" offset="8658213">The Court had said “I want to see the summary.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.777" offset="8674513">At this point, the United States Attorney turned over its file and the Court went through it, and then, after doing that, the Court turned over to the defendant in this case the summa -- the FBI summary of its very first interview with Meierdiercks, that's C4.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.627" offset="8789870">And then, it turned over -- it said -- the Court's letter, it said R70-71, and it's printed on page 13 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.567" offset="8845667">The Court also turned over a note that had been added to the copy of the signed statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.963" offset="8927274">The Court said, when it turned it over, “I have had the FBI report dated July 12, that's the date of the signed statement, marked C4.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.213" offset="8960188">This report contains a copy of the statement of May 12 -- I'm sorry, May 12, which I understand has been delivered to you, and then, it has the following materials” and it turned over the note that had been put on the copy, which was an additional fact recalled by Meierdiercks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.096" offset="9035734">And, it did not turn over certain other documents in the file.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.985" offset="9063320">Those -- it's sealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.828" offset="9078680">It's perfectly clear that the Court did turn over the summary of interviews with Meierdiercks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.222" offset="9112221">What was not turned over is described by the Court of Appeals in its opinion, we printed that on page 14 of our brief, that one of the documents contained no reference to, much less the texts of any summation, text or any summation of anything said by either witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.232" offset="9200306">Two were office memoranda concerning the progress of a then-pending prosecution against Meierdiercks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.947" offset="9231130">Another is a physical description of Meierdiercks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.956" offset="9243146">Another is an unsuccessful search of certain names on hotel registries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.138" offset="9267911">Now, the Court also noted that there was an office notation of the fact that Meierdiercks, when arrested, had denied all implications in the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.398" offset="9316916">But, the inter -- the summary of the interview where that was done had been turned over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.204" offset="9340217">So that, in other words, what the Court of Appeals found was that, after Meierdiercks, everything had been turned over except material that was in no sense attributable to Meierdiercks, in no sense whatsoever, except insofar as there was a copy attached to that report of the statement -- of the longhand statement which we have sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.511" offset="9457455">Now, as to Ms. Vossler, she, as I say, never identified petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.254" offset="9480338">She was merely the victim of this and she dealt only with Meierdiercks and with a man named Mr. Rice who was never identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.095" offset="9515760">She never saw petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.842" offset="9522761">She didn't name him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.449" offset="9533210">As to her, the Court delivered -- the Government delivered to the Court immediately and turned over a report which she had signed, which gave a detailed statement of what had occurred in January.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.032" offset="9623489">It also turned over certain other summary which were detailed that Ms. Vossler has applied, including then, like her speculation as to how the defendant might possibly have gotten her name, in which she named an individual who never was shown to have any significance of the crime and in which she -- and which happened also to contain facts that she hadn't identified certain other individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.529" offset="9797465">The Court turned all that over nevertheless, and then, he said “the United States Attorney has also turned over to me,” because the United States Attorney had turned over his file in view of this dispute as to what should be done, “certain letters and I will look at those letters, and I'll see if they had anything to do with the case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.100" offset="9895790">And, so, he went through that group of letters and turned over two which are C13 and C14, which the defense has seen, which have some mention of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.141" offset="9955976">They were letters written after Ms. Vossler had testified at the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.296" offset="9980531">But, the Court of Appeals found that the Court didn't turnover, and which the Court of Appeals thought should have been turned over, were the letters which was described by the Court of Appeals as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.845" offset="10050748">And that's at page 16 of our brief, 96 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.988" offset="10075303">A letter to the Prosecutor by Ms. Vossler just before the second trial of the case in which she expressed concern that the lack of time had made her recollection of details hazy, so that, she would have to rely upon her previously detailed statement to refresh her memory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.412" offset="10165060">Now, this was written by Ms. Vossler and, in the very broadest, it may have related to her testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.759" offset="10210408">But, it had absolutely no -- this is the only statement that had anything possibly to do with the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.989" offset="10243323">And, it is, I think, seriously questionable whether this can be said to relate to the subject matter of her testimony, but this is the sole iss -- the sole document which the Court of Appeals found among the sealed exhibits which could possibly have been said to be relevant insofar as they were not duplicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.304" offset="10340603">And, as to that, this is what the defense said about what they wanted to do with the report that they got, and this is at page 64 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.270" offset="10404446">The question was -- the defense had asked for more time to study the reports of Ms. Vossler, and the question was, well, the Court said “do you de -- intend to deny that these things happened?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.680" offset="10462124">And, trial counsel said “may it please the Court, we are not denying the allegation that Ms. Vossler is making from the stand, not in the least, but there are certain things that she has not testified to that are contained in these other reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.014" offset="10535476">There are certain items which we must assume are as truthful as the statement she is making here, and we want to get all this in the record,” and that's what the Court -- that's what defense counsel did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.420" offset="10601096">The transcript which hasn't been printed shows that he had her read her signed statement and had her read pages of these -- all reports to refresh her recollection so she could give details.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.165" offset="10672044">So that, the failure to produce even if, since time is going short, it could possibly be deemed the statement, the failure to produce this one letter saying that her recollection was hazy can't be considered prejudicial error in view of the fact that whole statement of the defense was “we want to use these statements because” -- at one point, he had said, “we want to use these statements to get in this material which she hasn't testified to,” and that brings me to the question of harmless error in relation to these problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.721" offset="10862216">This Court, in the Kotteakos case, went through the whole history of the harmless error statute which, as to criminal cases, is embodied in Rule 52.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.421" offset="10917073">And, we -- there is one sentence of it that I think summarizes what that whole history said, and that is that the object of the statute was simple to substitute judgment for automatic application of rules, to preserve review as a check upon arbitrary action and essential unfairness in trial but, at the same time, to make the process perform that function without giving men, fairly convicted, the multiplicity of loopholes which any highly rigid and minutely detailed scheme of errors, especially in relation to procedure, will engender and reflect in a printed record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.070" offset="11127620">Now, this, as the Court went on to the say in Kotteakos, is easier to say than to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.459" offset="11153220">But it seems to me, the important thing is that it does involve judgment and, so, it can't be said that just because we don't know what the defense might have done with something if, in the judgment of the whole case, whatever the defense would have done with it, it really has no significant relation to the case, there must be judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.617" offset="11277876">And, in this case, as it happens, we don't even have to speculate about what the defense would have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.633" offset="11297938">We know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.129" offset="11303894">The defense said “what we want to do, we know Ms. Vossler is telling the truth.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.163" offset="11324061">They repeated that in argument to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.599" offset="11333778">They said “we're not denying Ms. Vossler is telling the truth, but she didn't implicate petitioner.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.435" offset="11361155">They said “what we want to do with these statements is to put in the fact that she forgotten.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.458" offset="11385187">Then, on that basis, it can't be said that the fact that they didn't have a letter which takes it -- isn't really a statement in any sense of the word, but which merely reflects the fact that, in time, her memory had gotten somewhat hazy, something the defense absolutely knew and relied upon to get in material which is only very remotely relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.237" offset="11492289">In view of that fact, it is clear in this case, it seems to me, that judgment -- there's hardly judgment involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.289" offset="11528547">But, even in a somewhat other type of case, it does become necessary to look at possible errors, if there could be, in relation to the whole case and that there cannot be any kind of an automatic rule saying, merely because we do not what a defense might have done --</text>

            <label>Ms. Beatrice Rosenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="2932.386" offset="11832926">Well, Your Honor, I don't think that even a violation of constitutional rights or a statutory right that it's less open in Kotteakos but, nevertheless, for example, let's take a motion to suppress which should have been granted as to, let's say, two grains of narcotics, a theoretical case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.030" offset="11963538">When one can't cover those two grains and 42 other grains, which are completely proofed, that is, as I read the Kotteakos decision and the history which it embodied, let me say that the Kotteakos decision does leave open the question of, possibly, a constitutional or statutory right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.758" offset="12078373">But, if you read the history they had set forth and what Congress is trying to do and what, in a sense, the appellate function is, it seems to me that even so, even if it's a constitutional right, ther -- it doesn't mean that an appellate court is still not automatically, just finding that, required to reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.446" offset="12189132">No matter how insignificant the error, no matter how unimportant the witness or, as in this case, in a situation where we know that what the defense was trying to do was to improve her recollection rather than show that it was hazy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.251" offset="12268335">And, it seems to me that, therefore, there has to be judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.038" offset="12283486">Now, there are certain things, of course, that change the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.143" offset="12303966">If -- if you're dealing with something like a confession, and that's the example the Kotteakos case gives, there is something the -- there can always be a doubt if you don't have the defending admitting -- the defendant admitting it himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.020" offset="12371466">Therefore, the courts have said a confession, by and large, is so inherently difficult, that no matter how great the proof, we will reverse if we find the confession was not properly given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.131" offset="12435937">But, that's a very different thing from saying that this witness or, in some of the other cases, where you have a situation where, if that material was used to the ultimate reach that any possible person could reach it, even so, it simply really didn't go to the issues in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.322" offset="12540635">There is no doubt about the fact that where you have room for doubt, room for difficulty, it's one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.421" offset="12573027">But, here, you have a case of a judge who did as he said, “lean over backwards.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.170" offset="12592044">There isn't any question in the world that if he thought this letter would have been the slightest bit useful to the defendant, he would have handed it over.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.730" offset="12626317">But that, in view of all that they had and in view of the little that was not given to them which, as I say in this case, we know that they didn't intend to use then, it seems to me, an appellate court would not be doing justice if it reversed on such ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.946" offset="12715133">There's one other topic that I think I should cover because it wasn't reached and it was raised to enact this matter of pretrial discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.096" offset="12771767">Jencks didn't involve pretrial discovery.</text>

            <text syncTime="3171.861" offset="12790784">Well, it wasn't raised in petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.112" offset="12803845">It's here only in the sense that the question on which this Court granted certiorari includes a question where the Jencks is a rule of mere procedure or involved a defendant's constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.922" offset="12879078">And, apparently, the petitioner has said that constitutional rights include the right to pretrial discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.372" offset="12908857">I was about to say that in the Government's view, this question is not properly here because it was not raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.341" offset="12932786">And, in turn, it was not argued in petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.522" offset="12953475">I can also say that, it seems to me, the language could not be clearer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.278" offset="12972492">And the legislative history just confirmed the absolute clearness of the congressional decision that these, according to statements that are involved in this legislation, shall not be produced until after the witness has testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.064" offset="13043649">Now, of course, it is true that Rule 16 and Rule 17, as interpreted by this Court in the Bowman Dairy case, reached documents of another kind that don't involve statements by the witnesses but, as the statements of government witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.360" offset="13136854">The statute and the legislative history is decisive that Congress made the decision that those should not be produced until trial, that they should not be produced pretrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.997" offset="13191398">And, it seems to me, clearly a subject matter on which Congress had the right to legislate because the right to get this material pretrial was not known before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.395" offset="13248972">And it was the subject of controversy at the District Court level just in a sense, it was a -- something just beginning to be talked about before the statute was passed, and then, Congress made a definite decision between two conflicting points of view on that issue and decided that these should be produced at the trial.</text>
