            <text syncTime="45.718" offset="286281">At some however, other been deceived or entrapped into committing the offenses with which they were subsequently indicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.596" offset="325778">That, the -- the basis for that suggestion is in the dissenting opinion of one of the judges of the original consideration of the case in the Ohio Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="112.674" offset="554088">“Under the situation in the present cases, it seems clear to me that the defendants after being apprised by the Commission that they had a right to rely upon the protection against self-incrimination could not be in contempt with the Commission except as to the few questions which two of them were directed to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.396" offset="624933">I want to make this point, nowhere in this record of the Talmadge-Brown or Stern hearings is there any statement from the chairman of this Commission or from any member of it along the lines stated here as the fact backing that portion of this dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.313" offset="724616">You will recall that this Court, the Supreme Court of Ohio, when it's hearing this matter, is hearing two cases involving four defendants.</text>

            <text syncTime="219.041" offset="979571">The only other portion of that opinion, I want to refer to and I am not adopting it as the State's position here, is to point out that even that judge in his dissent, reserves for his own consideration without deciding the possibility that two of the three defendants, Raley, Brown or Stern may in his own language be in contempt except as to the few questions which two of them were directed to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.465" offset="1109243">And the record there is clear in regard to these three defendants in case number 175.</text>

            <text syncTime="367.238" offset="1572342">And in doing so, it was a rather extensive weeding job.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.448" offset="1601181">The conviction of Raley was affirmed on seven of 16 counts and reversed on all other accounts.</text>

            <text syncTime="404.600" offset="1721762">The reasoning of Judge Mathews in the Court of Appeals in affirming those counts which were affirmed by his court, does not go to the extent of ruling that there was a specific positive requirement that the witness received a direct order to answer a question in order to be in contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.161" offset="1835969">The Court of Appeals opinion was to the effect that the witness under the circumstances where the Committee Chairman or a member of the Committee is asking the questions that there is a -- an order, an implied order to answer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2531.991" offset="10231306">In the time remaining, I should like to address myself to the question of the Ohio immunity statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.517" offset="10257429">May I say at the outset that I believe the -- by a mistake, this Court was misinformed as to the applicability of the Ohio statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.502" offset="10305390">The distinction between committees and commissions in Ohio is not a very precise one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.191" offset="10332139">As a matter of fact, this particular question was considered by the Supreme Court of Ohio and in the first branch of the syllabus, stated very specifically that this was a select committee so as to be with in the terms of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.537" offset="10397550">Now, I should like to point out in this regard that that the Ohio statute on immunity is not like the federal statute where there must be a specific action taken before the immunity is conferred, where the Attorney General must be consulted in the District Court of permission granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.570" offset="10469648">To the contrary, in Ohio, the provision for immunity before the legislature is a great that you must specifically divest your self up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.046" offset="10519594">You have it until you take action and you must take your action in writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.184" offset="10540074">Now, this is similar of course to the Ohio law on a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.861" offset="10554807">A person is entitled as a matter of law to a jury trial, unless they specifically waive their right in writing, so too is it the immunity statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.899" offset="10594931">There is no question in the record that at no point or that at any point were these witnesses told of the immunity statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.000" offset="10627323">But the statute does exist, it did exist and it did cover these witnesses as fully and as completely as the State of Ohio could do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.637" offset="10669955">If these witnesses in fact do not have immunity, it is not because of the action of the legislature of Ohio, it is despite the action of the legislature of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.682" offset="10710079">And I submit that this is an important consideration particularly in view of the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.008" offset="10731395">But getting back to the record, and in connection with the -- the discussion that has gone on as to the misleading by the Chairman of these witnesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="4224.169" offset="17000051">I should like to call the Court's attention to what I consider a very important element in this case which -- which is as relevant to, particularly to Mr. -- appellant, Stern's refusal to answer the question, the point where -- where you live, the question as to where he lives.</text>
            <text syncTime="4241.123" offset="17067865">This Court will note that the mandate to the Commission required or -- or authorized the -- the Commission and this is on page 5 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4254.314" offset="17120632">“To maintain a liaison with any agency of the federal state or local governments in devising and promoting means of disclosing those persons in groups who seek to alter or destroy the Government of this State or of the United States by forced filings, intimidations, sabotage or threats of the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="4273.280" offset="17196492">I think this -- Court's attention should be called to the fact that throughout these hearings, these witnesses, and each of them were asked many questions about men, their associations with men, their friendship with men who were then under indictment under the Smith Act in federal court who had been convicted of -- of a violation of the Smiths Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4295.812" offset="17286666">But more importantly, in this particular instance in which Mr. Stern refused to answer the question as to where he lived, Frank Hashmall was later alleged to have been at his residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4306.691" offset="17330134">Frank Hashmall subsequent to these hearings was indicted under the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4314.113" offset="17359809">Subsequent to these hearings, Frank Hashmall was indicted under the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4318.043" offset="17375587">And I submit to Your Honors that it -- it was very proper and very correct for -- for appellant, Stern, to be concerned about questions, about with whom he lived and where he lived and who lived with him, particularly given the fact that the -- it seems to be to the Commission's opinion that Mr. Frank Hashmall, who subsequent to these hearings, had -- was indicted under the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4340.005" offset="17463359">I feel that this -- this whole case and all of the issues that the case raises stand or indicate one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4350.396" offset="17504946">Human experience, as I think Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out in the Ollman case has a tendency -- there was a tendency in human experience to abuse power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4360.445" offset="17545174">And I think, Your Honors, that not only is there a tendency to abuse power, I think there's a tendency to abuse power in the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4368.908" offset="17579029">The National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement summarized the rather inglorious history of the Star Chamber and the High Commission, the ecclesiastical courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4379.692" offset="17622183">And pointed out that in those days, those -- those commissions in courts which did not operate like our judiciary does today exactly, were trying to do much the same things and have the same tendencies to do the things that this Commission had tried to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4395.173" offset="17684041">To not have a specific charge, because when you have a specific charge, it requires that the questions must be pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4401.910" offset="17711000">To be authorized to poke around into somebody's life and -- and into their activities in hopes that they might be able to find someway to condemn, to indict, to accuse, to expose an individual whose activities may have created a certain amount of hostility on the -- so far as the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4421.674" offset="17790098">And I suggest that the whole tenor and attitude and authority of this Commission stem back or generated to the very problems that -- out of this high Commission, out of this Star Chamber, out of the ecclesiastical courts hail specifically, the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4439.875" offset="17862823">But the operations of those -- of those courts were much the same as legislative investigating commissions can be if they're not required to -- to take into account pertinence, if there isn't a specific matter under inquiry so that he witness can determine whether or not the -- the Commission has the authority to ask the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4461.117" offset="17947878">And therefore I submit to Your Honor that these convictions should not be allowed to -- to stand, they violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and I urge their reverse.</text>
