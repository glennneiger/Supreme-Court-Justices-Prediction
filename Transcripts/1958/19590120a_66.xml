            <text syncTime="23.488" offset="197360">Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.074" offset="219617">This is the second occasion upon which this case is before this Court for consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.655" offset="245948">However, I believe that because of issues raised in the brief of respondent, it might be desirable to review very briefly the facts of the case and the determinations of law in the various courts prior to its appears again before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.102" offset="319822">Now, we believe that the testimony discloses that the union presented a contract to the employer for its examination and advised that it would not request the employer to sign it until the employees joined or agreed to join the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.694" offset="406131">And we believe that's verified by the record at page 96, 229, pages 231 and 232, 244, 265 and 309.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.301" offset="476557">And we believe that the reference to page 309 is particularly pertinent because that is the testimony by the plaintiff in the case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles P. Scully</label>
            <text syncTime="105.544" offset="525563">That they presented the contract to the employer for examination and that they stated they would not request him to sign it until the employees joined or agreed to join.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.712" offset="574255">And I think it's critical because we believe that the case of Weber is applicable here and there has been a determination below by the trial court on other evidence binding contrary to this contention by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.602" offset="633814">And we've accordingly believed that the Court should be aware of the fact that there was evidence presented, that it -- in effect this was not a compulsion on the employer to coerce his employees but on the contrary that the union contacted the employees first and advised the employer they would not require him to sign until they agreed to join.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_p_scully" startTime="165.561" stopTime="542.776">
            <label>Mr. Charles P. Scully</label>
            <text syncTime="165.561" offset="765576">All right, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.654" offset="778010">In that regard, then I think its desirable, Your Honor, to point out that with respect to the chronological order of the case that -- with respect to the issue that was involved in this case, the employers attorney testified that a -- a petition for representation was filed with the Board by mailing from San Diego to the Los Angeles office on May 7, 1953, that is page 191 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.199" offset="952195">That on the same day, a complaint was filed in the Superior Court of San Diego and that is found at page 196 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.053" offset="1019591">That the complaint gave rise to injunctive relief and that thereafter, the regional office of the Board dismissed the petition for representation from which no appeal of any kind was taken and that the trial court then on the ground that there had been a violation of the National Act granted injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.074" offset="1147695">The union appealed to the District Court of Appeals of the State of California and I think it's interesting to know that in that appeal, in reversing the determination of the trial court, and this is at page 32 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.634" offset="1225958">The District Court of Appeal found that the picketing was without violence or a breach of peace and did not involve any secondary boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.774" offset="1274441">That is at page 32 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.306" offset="1292622">The appeal was then taken from this decision of the District Court reversing the trial court to the Supreme Court of the State of California, which by four to three decision reversed the District Court and sustained the trial court and stated that although the Board concededly had primary jurisdiction, and this is at the record on page 46, and I'm now quoting, “There is no conflict of jurisdiction where the federal Board determines not to adjudicate the issue.”</text>
            <text syncTime="334.351" offset="1440789">And that is at page 48 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.681" offset="1454059">And accordingly, because of the letter from the regional office of the Board dismissing the petition on the ground that the amount of business was insufficient toward the exercise of jurisdiction by the Board, it admitted that under the state law, the concerted activity was a proper labor objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.418" offset="1540995">That's is at page 51 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.206" offset="1556146">But then held that the economic pressure to compel an employer to sign the type of agreement here involved is an unfair labor practice under Section 8 (b) (2) of the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.214" offset="1632214">That's at page 52 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.134" offset="1643917">And so the first decision of the State Court of California was specifically on the ground that there was a violation of Section 8 (b) (2) of the Taft-Hartley Act and that the conduct was otherwise legal under the California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.593" offset="1709746">The case then came to this Court and this Court noted that the picketing was peaceful, that the plaintiffs had alleged a violation of the Taft-Hartley Act and together with Guss and Fairlawn reversed the decision with respect to the injunctive relief, reserved its decision as to the failure to exhaust administrative remedies on the ground that it was necessary to reach it and then stated that it did not reach the question of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.848" offset="1882781">The case then went back to the California Supreme Court and it conceded that with respect to the injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.466" offset="1917262">It was not possible for it to sustain the judgment of the trial court and accordingly, it reversed as to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.095" offset="1947773">But then it construed the remand of this Court and stated that this Court had invited the California Court, and this is the page 332 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.437" offset="2005138">That it had invited the California Court to examine the state law to determine whether a cause of action for damages in Court could be maintained under that law in a situation which this Court referred to as different from the violence in the Laburnum, stated that the particular case was distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.861" offset="2094791">And then it's included, and this is at page 337 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.979" offset="2119241">And this is -- quoting, "Based on the foregoing provisions of the statutory law of this State in the findings and conclusions of the trial court which is amply supported by the evidence, the conduct of the defendants constituted unlawful labor practices contrary to and in violation to the laws of the State."</text>
            <text syncTime="527.760" offset="2214431">And so I believe Mr. Chief Justices -- Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court, that summarizes very briefly for you what has transpired in the courts below insofar as the litigation in this case is concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="555.320" offset="2324668">And that's what I -- that's -- that's what I had started, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.309" offset="2336580">I had pointed out with respect to the first item the testimony that the union had presented the contract to the employer for its examination in a statement that would not request its signature until after the employees had joined or agreed to join the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.371" offset="2400841">Then the union advised the employer that all of the men were agreeable to becoming members of the union and that's in the record at pages 103 and at page 237.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.143" offset="2463953">So that the union went out, spoke to the employees, they agreed to become members and the union then advised the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.831" offset="2494673">The employer then stated that it wished to speak to each man individually.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.269" offset="2516407">That's at page 103 and page 238 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.423" offset="2537096">And the employer spoke to them outside the presence of any union representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.925" offset="2563114">That -- that's at page 110 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.406" offset="2577011">The employer then stated, and this -- testimony by the employers at page 240 of the record, that he didn't want any union that in the testimony from an employee witness was that the employees drew an inference that the employer disapproved of unions, page 133 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.943" offset="2659140">And in fact, the employer admitted that everyone knew he was not union-minded, page 159 of the record, and that he left the employees know his feeling.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.281" offset="2708459">That's at page 269 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.474" offset="2725282">The employer testified also that he had never employed a union member and have never signed a union contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.505" offset="2765406">That's at page 111 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.240" offset="2780348">The employees then later decided to leave it up to management whether they should join or not join the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.997" offset="2819323">That's at page 120 and 129 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.517" offset="2841475">But then later on, they changed their minds about joining and the employer advised the union representative that the employees had voted unanimously no union, page 240 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.732" offset="2914304">At that time, the union representative stated that he believe management and I'm quoting, “had influenced the employees in his absence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="713.847" offset="2958712">That's page 270 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.924" offset="2975117">Then after the employees had decided not to join the union, there was a raise in wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.405" offset="3005001">That's at page 131 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.000" offset="3019421">And then it was that the unions instituted what we contend was peaceful picketing with the sign reading and I'm quoting, "Millmen's Union 2020 Teamsters Union number 36, invite employees to join."</text>
            <text syncTime="748.610" offset="3097788">That's at page 262 of the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="758.621" offset="3137808">That was the only sign and the record will disclose that it is the first time that such type of a sign had been used by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.189" offset="3180126">Then the employers' attorney testified with respect to items I have just mentioned that a petition have been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.847" offset="3214712">You'll find that at page 191 of the record that there had never been any filing of an unfair labor practice charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.412" offset="3248985">That's 197 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.535" offset="3261524">That there has never been any appeal from the dismissal of the representation petition by the Regional Director of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.858" offset="3302797">And as I say, there was contrary evidence to some of these items introduced at the trial court and then the trial court made its finding that with respect to the business of the plaintiff, it affected interstate commerce and then found that the conduct of the union was for the purpose of compelling the employer to coerce his employees to join the union in violation of the National Act and issued an injunction and damages in the sum of $1000 with the injunction reading that it should remain, and I'm quoting, “Unless and until the defendants have been properly designated as the collective bargaining representative of the plaintiff's employees or inappropriate unit thereof.”</text>
            <text syncTime="854.055" offset="3519613">And that's on the record on page 17, and then it entered judgment in accordance with its finding of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.842" offset="3554722">And so I believe, Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justices, I have briefly summarized for you the procedural backgrounds of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.117" offset="3591816">I have attempted to give to you the facts of this case as we believe they could be viewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.485" offset="3617311">We believe that, that is important because as far as we are concerned, we respectfully submit to the Court that this case is governed by the decision in Garner and Weber and the decision in Oliver issued by this Court yesterday and that it is not controlled by the so-called Laburnum doctrine as stated by the respondents in this particular case.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="1043.326" offset="4276642">Mr. Scully, is there any dispute as to whether there was any violence in there?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_p_scully" startTime="1047.426" stopTime="1439.526">
            <label>Mr. Charles P. Scully</label>
            <text syncTime="1047.426" offset="4293047">There is no dispute and in the first decision in this case, this Court itself specifically stated that the conduct was peaceful, and you will find that in the appendix to our petition for certiorari and it's on page 50, in which this Court stated, “The union's commence peaceful picketing to enforce their demand.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.559" offset="4389595">And that is found in the decision of this Court in its first opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.102" offset="4403806">And so we submit the -- that also in the record both in the court below and in the testimony that there is no dispute but that the conduct was peaceful, you'll recall that I referred to the decision of the District Court of Appeal where not only indicated that was peaceful but that not even any secondary boycott was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.901" offset="4502967">The reason I stressed that is because of an inference in the Government's brief which we received yesterday along the lines of secondary boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.152" offset="4539956">Then if we may, we believe that the language in the Garner and Weber cases are particularly pertinent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.008" offset="4571408">In the Garner case, this Court stated and I'm quoting, “The power and duty of primary decision lies with the Board, not with us.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.212" offset="4620204">They also stated, “We conclude that when federal power constitutionally is exerted for the protection of public or private interest or both, it becomes the supreme law of -- supreme law of the land and cannot be curtailed, circumvented, or extended by a state procedure merely because it will apply some doctrine of private rights to the extent that the private rights may conflict with the public ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.110" offset="4763773">The former is superseded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.436" offset="4773073">And that's at page of 500 and 501.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.387" offset="4792926">Then in the Weber case, this Court stated that -- and I'm quoting, “If this conduct does not fall within the prohibition of Section 8 of the Taft-Hartley Act, it may fall within the protection of Section 7 as concerted activity for the purpose of mutual aid and protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.835" offset="4878712">I do believe I may have misstated, within the prohibition of Section 8 and the protection of Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.516" offset="4905462">And there again, I think the facts of this case as I have outlined from the Court are particularly pertinent because in this case, the union contended that it was a peaceful picketing with respect to organizational activity, the Court found that it was coercive picketing to compel an employer to compel his employees to join the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.907" offset="4991039">And so we believe that factually, this case squarely counts within the statement of the Weber case namely that it could either be protected activity or prohibited activity and that it is up to the Board and the Board alone in the first instance to make that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.303" offset="5052583">But that here, a trial court where no unfair labor practice charge had even been filed steps in and intruding itself in violation of the doctrine of Garner, comes in and makes a determination that it was a violation of Section 8 (b) (2) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.212" offset="5120188">And I have quoted that portion of the record already to this Court in which the Supreme Court of the State of California specifically found that this was an 8 (b) (2) violation, although what had never even been before the Board and although no charge had ever been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.467" offset="5185285">With respect to the decision of this Court yesterday, we believe the language is particularly pertinent insofar as this case is concerned at pages 49 -- 48 and 49 of the -- of the page proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.267" offset="5260413">The Court has stated in the Oliver decision, “Congress has provided for a system of federal law applicable to the agreements -- agreement the parties made in response to that duty citing Lincoln Mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.655" offset="5314017">And federal law sets some outside limits not contended to be exceeded here on what their agreement may provide,” citing the Allen-Bradley and other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.845" offset="5362709">And then continuing, “There is no room in this scheme for the application here or this State policy limiting the solution that the parties' agreement can provide to the problem of wages and working conditions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.633" offset="5421955">And then finally, and we believe this is particularly applicable here because of the argument of respondents that it's the nature of the remedy rather than the substance of the dispute that should control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.027" offset="5471483">This Court stated at the bottom of page 49 and at the top of page 50, “Clearly, it is immaterial that the conflict is between federal law and the application of what the state characterizes as an antitrust law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.224" offset="5540237">We believe that's particularly pertinent here because we submit that respondents are now attempting to re-characterize the nature of the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.682" offset="5578062">We submit that as we have quoted the record to you, the California Supreme Court pursuant to the finding of the trial court specifically found that this conduct initially was illegal because it was a violation of 8 (b) (2) even though it had never been before the Board on an unfair labor practice charge that the case is still founded upon that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.350" offset="5672730">That accordingly, under the principle of Garner, Weber, and Oliver, if this Court permits a state court under the facts of this case to intervene by awarding damages, it not only will permit a multiplicity of actions to be asserted in the labor management field but also will in effect permit it to -- to give a type, in effect a type of -- of prevented relief because a multiplicity of damage actions can be as equally preventive as an injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.929" offset="5807104">Then if we may, Your Honor, we would like briefly to attempt to indicate how we believe the cases relied upon by respondents are not applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.581" offset="5857677">First, with respect --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="1439.526" stopTime="1452.183">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="1439.526" offset="5861439">And before you do that, I was looking -- whether the -- which is just extension opinion, dealt with the bearing of adversity upon problem now before us.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles P. Scully</label>
            <text syncTime="1452.183" offset="5912116">I do not believe it does, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.531" offset="5933537">All right, first, if we may then, Your Honor, the first particular case is of course the Laburnum case itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.435" offset="5973138">In the Laburnum case, we believe it is to be noted that the conduct was violent and that in accordance with the decision of this Court in the Kohler case, the state court could have awarded both injunctive relief and damages and accordingly, we believe that that case is not applicable to this case because this Court in its first decision has clearly indicated that this field is preemptive insofar as the Garner decision is concerned and has reversed as to injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.630" offset="6105840">And so, we believe that Laburnum case is not applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.852" offset="6126738">Secondly, with respect to the remaining two cases, the first one is the Russell decision, and we believe here that the Russell decision is even further removed from the orbit of the so-called labor management field which is involved in this case because that involved the prevention of access to a plant by violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.766" offset="6250454">An employee was prohibited from entering the plant because of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.982" offset="6267277">And we submit that absent any labor dispute at all, assuming there was no labor dispute at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.248" offset="6292355">That clearly, this would be conduct which would be subject to state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.295" offset="6308551">And that accordingly, that conduct is totally remote from the conduct to this case, where we have peaceful picketing, which may depend upon the determination of the Board.Be either protected or prohibited under the National Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.680" offset="6370095">Finally, with respect to the Gonzales case, we believe that also is clearly distinguishable because it involved purely personal rights of the member of a labor organization with respect to his contract with the labor organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.639" offset="6441880">And so we respectfully submit to this Court that in accordance with the doctrine of Garner, Weber and Oliver, that the State Court in the facts present in this case is without authority to award damages and we accordingly, respectfully submit that that portion of the determination should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1621.667" offset="6590046">I think that the case would be a little bit clearer in my mind not in minds of the Court if I reviewed briefly the background as I understand it to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.716" offset="6654203">There was a picket line established by the petitioners here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.341" offset="6684714">There was a dispute as to the nature of that picketing which dispute was resolved by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.560" offset="6713657">And this findings of fact were held upon field to be supported by the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.812" offset="6734660">And why when I state the facts, I'm not stating our version of the facts or the union's version of the facts but the facts as found by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.024" offset="6775515">And the facts found were these.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.844" offset="6786800">That the unions had presented the employer with a contract which contained a union shop clause that they had demand -- demanded that he sign it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.812" offset="6842598">That's when he refused to do so because his employees had not designated the union as their bargain -- bargaining representative, and apparently didn't want it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.667" offset="6886066">They established the picket line for the purpose of forcing him to sign this contract and thus, to interfere with his employees and their free choice of the bargaining representative and to discriminate them against them for failure to join this union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.842" offset="6958791">Now, those are the facts as found by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.788" offset="6970493">The activity was the activity of a stranger union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.359" offset="6988779">The National Labor Relations Board through its general counsel declined to take jurisdiction of the representation matter because the impact of the employer's business on commerce was so slight that the Board did not think that the matter required its attention.</text>

            <text syncTime="2014.719" offset="8162200">It said that the fact that the case fell in this twilight zone was immaterial because the only way that the National Board can cede to a state its power to prevent was the method proscribed by Section 10 (a) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.899" offset="8234924">However, the employer argued that though the state court was deprived the power to grant injunctive relief, it nevertheless was empowered to award damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.831" offset="8298663">And to follow on that question, this Court said this, “Respondents however, argue that the award of damages must be sustained.</text>

            <text syncTime="2061.875" offset="8350908">The California Supreme Court leaves us in doubt, but its opinion indicates that it felt bound to apply or in some sense follow federal law in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2086.172" offset="8448084">We cannot know that the California Court would have interpreted its own state law to allow an award of damages in this different situation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.661" offset="8494059">And the case was remanded to the California Supreme Court for the purpose of permitting it to determine whether there was liability for damages under the state law of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.525" offset="8549439">The state court reviewed that question and determined that that Section 923 of the California Labor Code, like a similar provision in the National Labor Relations Act, rendered it against public policy for an employer to discriminate against employees because of union membership or left thereof or to otherwise interfere with them in the exercise of their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.113" offset="8683813">And that for that reason, the picketing was for the purpose of compelling the employer to a violative public policy of the State of California and it was tortuous.</text>

            <text syncTime="2240.619" offset="9065827">Now, throughout the debate, they ran this theme of concern for the small employer of the need to give him additional protection against various union abuses, and it was upon that theme that the debate closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.423" offset="9141060">In presenting the closing argument in favor of overriding the present -- presidential veto, Senator Taft again said.</text>

            <text syncTime="2333.312" offset="9436662">He has been denied injunctive relief under state law because the Board's power to prevent is exclusive of parallel power upon the part of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.288" offset="9500505">And because Section 10 (a) of the Act provides the only method by which the Board can cede to a State this power to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.767" offset="9554422">And now we are here with the petitioners condemn -- contending that not only is this employer deprived of all right with any kind of preventative relief, but that he has -- is also deprived of a right of action for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.637" offset="9637909">Now, if the petitioners are correct in this contention, then it means that this employer who has been injured by conduct, which violates both state and federal law and for which each provides remedies, is without any remedy whatever.</text>

            <text syncTime="2849.964" offset="11503261">The substance of that argument is that the jurisdiction of the State does not depend solely upon the nature of the remedy, but depends also on the nature of the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.868" offset="11558849">And that the Laburnum case is distinguishable because it involved violence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2901.496" offset="11709315">First of all, he said in the Laburnum case, there was no conflict between the federal and state law because the conduct was a tort under Virginia law and an unfair labor practice under the federal statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3274.754" offset="13202369">Now, the fact is that Congress enacted Section 303 of the Taft-Hartley Act which renders certain conduct tortuous in terms practically identical with Section 8 (b) (4) of the National Labor Relations Act which characterizes that same conduct as an unfair labor practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3368.562" offset="13577592">At the same time, the Board would be required as provided in the committee bill on which I shall comment in the moment to seek injunctive relief which means that -- that there would be two of the actions going on the same time or that there might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.984" offset="13643316">Well, they acquiesced in this latter provision when it was added to the bill.</text>

            <text syncTime="3604.303" offset="14520613">And after all, it is the intent of the Congress with which we are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.139" offset="14539943">And I might add that there is much less danger of conflict between a State applying state law and the federal Board applying state law -- federal law, then there is a conflict between two bodies applying the same federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3662.727" offset="14754252">Well now, the fact is -- furthermore, with respect to this question of violence which arose a moment ago that the Laburnum case did not go off on the basis of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.898" offset="14834918">Now, true, there was violent conduct involved in that case, but the Court's decision was not based upon that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.268" offset="14868459">The rationale of the Court's decision was simply that a judgment for damages did not present any potential conflict with preventative relief by the Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="3749.214" offset="15100217">I don't think that the Board has given any discretion in determining whether or not there has or has not been an unfair labor practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3963.995" offset="15959333">Well, that to me is a distinction which makes no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3969.776" offset="15982425">It really isn't a distinction because here, the California Court was not applying a basic rule of law which is simply the product of a labor relation statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3983.585" offset="16037700">It, like the Virginia Court, was applying a rule of law which says in substance that an unprivileged interference with the business of another is tortuous.</text>

            <text syncTime="4073.336" offset="16396727">And Justice Brandeis said this about it, “The right to carry on business, be it cause liberty or property has value.</text>
            <text syncTime="4086.908" offset="16450957">To interfere with this right without just cause is unlawful.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4092.085" offset="16471751">Now, that's simply the basic rule which has been applied here just as in the Laburnum case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4098.854" offset="16498813">And I cannot see that there is any distinction on that respect between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4103.318" offset="16516681">But let us suppose that the California law were a law, simply a labor relation statute, that's happening in some States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4111.399" offset="16548968">Why would that make a difference?</text>
            <text syncTime="4114.265" offset="16560462">Why would the nature of the statute and the source of the substantive rule, which we're applying make a difference as to whether or not there was or was not preemption?</text>
            <text syncTime="4129.180" offset="16620126">I just don't see any materiality to the problem before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="4136.399" offset="16648965">And the fact is that this Court in the Anheuser-Busch case seem to say that the nature of the statute is immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4146.724" offset="16690239">Whether the State is enforcing an antitrust law or a labor statute, the result is the same and that's what we're interested in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4166.207" offset="16768188">Now, having concluded that the Laburnum case was not in point and that the question for it there had or had not been decided, you would have thought that the dissent would have then looked to the statute to see if there was anything to justify the conclusion that this man was left without any remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4193.095" offset="16875708">But it didn't look at the statute from the premise that the point had not yet been decided by this Court has simply dealt to the conclusion that there was preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="4205.912" offset="16927013">Now, that conclusion I submit as well as the premise, the conclusion is unjustified.</text>
            <text syncTime="4218.093" offset="16975705">The Garner case, if I read it correctly, was based upon the language of the Act which confers power upon the Board to prevent unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="4231.022" offset="17027427">And this Court concluded that a State Court injunction might conflict with the Board's exercise of this parallel preventative power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4243.364" offset="17076851">The Guss case and this case, one of these before you before held that this preemption extended to the twilight zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="4255.349" offset="17124812">Because the only way in which the Board's power to prevent could be seated to a State was through the -- the session proceedings provided for -- for by Section 10 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="4273.361" offset="17196805">Now, that reasoning of course simply could not justify the conclusion that the State was deprived the power to award damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="4284.515" offset="17241422">The State's power to act, certainly, cannot depend upon session by the Board of a power which the Board does not have and it does not have the power to award damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="4296.677" offset="17290115">The very section which confers upon the Board its power to prevent provided that this power shall not be affected by any other means of adjustment or prevention that has been or may be established by agreement, law, or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4315.765" offset="17366392">Now, this seems to contemplate that there may be other means of adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4322.150" offset="17391992">And it says that the fact that there are other means of adjustment shall not affect the Board's power, shall not deprive it of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4331.187" offset="17428146">Now, just what did Congress understand that provision to mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="4335.921" offset="17447058">It didn't leave us in the dark as to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4338.603" offset="17457821">It said something which has been quoted in prior opinions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4350.474" offset="17505259">It said that, “By retaining the language which provides the Board's powers under Section 10 shall not be affected by other means of adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4361.887" offset="17550921">The conference agreement makes clear that when two remedies exist, one before the Board and one before the courts, the remedy before the Board shall be in addition to and not in lieu of other remedies.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4381.003" offset="17627408">Now, I don't know what clearer statement we could possibly hope for.</text>
            <text syncTime="4386.866" offset="17650813">That statement couldn't be referring simply to remedies in the Courts under Section 303 of the Act because the language to which it refers and which it was explaining had been contained in the Wagner Act at a time when there was no Section 303, so they couldn't simply have been talking about remedies in the courts under 303.</text>

            <text syncTime="4572.119" offset="18391855">There has been considerable talk in the opinions about the uniformity of the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4580.425" offset="18425083">And I think that if we are too general in such talk, we're liable to be misled because the Labor Relations Act does not attempt to impose and I think it's clear from the decisions of this Court that it does not attempt to impose a uniform form of code of labor law, which is to be exclusive of all other laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="4604.273" offset="18520482">It establishes substance -- certain substantive rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="4609.286" offset="18540544">For example, the rule that certain conduct is to be protected and it intends uniformity in the sense that it means that that is to be protected in all of the States and all of the states must observe those rights so protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="4625.748" offset="18606373">It is as for uniformity, in the sense that it creates certain to the wrongs called unfair labor practices which are to be unfair labor practices in all the States and not just some and creates a Board to enforce them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4644.900" offset="18682964">But I don't think it goes so far as to say that the States may not also enact law which does not conflict with the substantive law or that it might not -- may not provide remedies for violations of its own law.</text>

            <text syncTime="4690.255" offset="18864358">The only significance I attribute to the presence of violence in that case was that in the circumstances of that case, it rendered the union's conduct tortuous.</text>
            <text syncTime="4705.570" offset="18925693">Now, that was not the only reason however, the union's conduct was tortuous.</text>
            <text syncTime="4710.871" offset="18946905">And to speak of the Laburnum case as involving violence and violence only is wrong because it involves something more.</text>
            <text syncTime="4721.448" offset="18989119">You will recall that Laburnum was a contractor, that he had some contracts with some mining companies to do some construction work and that he had the promise from those companies of further contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4736.367" offset="19048887">He was awarded damages because the mining companies terminated his contracts and because they reneged on their promise of further work.</text>
            <text syncTime="4748.903" offset="19098937">That was his damage, the loss of business suffered by that means.</text>
            <text syncTime="4752.598" offset="19113775">Now, why did they terminate their contracts and why did they renege on their promise?</text>
            <text syncTime="4758.149" offset="19135927">Because they were threatened that unless they did so, you might have mine workers, would pull their own employees out on strike and they would be shut down.</text>
            <text syncTime="4768.169" offset="19176051">And the damages awarded in the Laburnum case were in fact and you will see this from reading the Court's opinion, the result of the threat of a secondary strike and consequent yielding by the mining companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4783.107" offset="19235819">Now, that language is in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Virginia and some of it was quoted in the opinion of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4793.673" offset="19278033">Now, in answer to your question, I can't distinguish violence from any other sort of tortuous conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4800.921" offset="19307081">It is not tortuous per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="4803.499" offset="19317321">Whether or not it's tortuous, depends upon its purpose usually upon the factual context in which it's committed just like any other context.</text>

            <text syncTime="4870.282" offset="19584502">I do believe however, we should point out that with respect to Mr. Plant's contention that this Court should consider the small employer and that even though the field is preemptive that it should permit damages, because otherwise that he is without any protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4889.090" offset="19659734">That with respect to that item, it should be stressed that this employer never even filed an unfair labor practice charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="4896.475" offset="19689305">The facts indicate that at the time he -- he mailed his charge, he already was in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4903.839" offset="19718771">Correction, at the time he filed his petition for representation, the same day he was in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4908.918" offset="19739042">He had no time to file the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="4910.629" offset="19745938">Secondly, that the argument he presents has been disposed of by this Court in the initial Guss, Garmon, and Fairlawn cases by saying that it is not even necessary for Congress to meet this problem because the Board can correct the problem by adjusting its discretion as to the scope of activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4931.746" offset="19830366">And in fact, we now know that they have revised in a substantial way their rules in regard to asserting jurisdiction and it may well be that an employer of this type, and there is the fining as the $250,000 here will well be subject to Board jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4952.951" offset="19915212">And so we submit that the argument overstates itself that there is not a question of no relief being available.</text>
            <text syncTime="4960.657" offset="19946036">But assuming -- assuming in spite of the action of the Board and assuming in spite of the failure of the employer to file any charge that there is this avenue still open, then we believe that this Court has already answered that argument in the first Garmon case with respect to the 10 (a) argument by saying that that's a matter that must be corrected by Congress and certainly, that this Court should not permit the award of damage in violation of the overall principles of a uniform National Act solely because in that particular refined area, an employer may not be afforded relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="5103.429" offset="20517073">The Court said, "The assertion of economic pressure to compel an employer to sign the type of agreement here involved is an unfair labor practice under Section 8 (b) (2) of the Act."</text>
            <text syncTime="5115.738" offset="20566288">And so our main answer is, Your Honor, that to permit the State Court to make that determination which is the primary function and duty of the Board is to create the worst possible types of conflict and we believe as already then precluded by the Garner and Weber decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="5147.220" offset="20692302">I -- I think that the whole reading of the opinion indicates that that is still the underlying thought of the Court and that it is not privileged conduct because it is violative of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5161.724" offset="20750294">Now, with respect to Mr. Plant's second main point, this 303 argument, we would like to make it clear first of all that in this case, we believe 303 is a no way involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5174.984" offset="20803271">The District Court of Appeal as we have noted indicated not only that it was peaceful, but there was no secondary boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="5182.376" offset="20832841">Secondly, we -- we believe that Mr. Plant has misconstrued Section 303.</text>
            <text syncTime="5190.041" offset="20863561">In this regard, it is to be pointed out that this Court in the Juneau Spruce decision at page 238 of the Supreme Court Reporter series stated, "Congress was here concerned with reshaping labor management legal relations and it was taking precise steps to declare an announced objective,” and then continuing, “for the jurisdiction dispute proscribed by Section 303 (a) (4) are reserved, -- are -- are made unlawful "for the purpose of this section only, thus setting apart for private redress acts which might also be subject to the administrative process," and then the Court continued and this is at page 239.</text>
            <text syncTime="5257.203" offset="21132204">"These prohibitions limiting and curtailing the administrative power find a counterpart in the provisions for private redress in 303 (a) (4).”</text>
            <text syncTime="5269.209" offset="21180165">And so we submit first of all that Section 303 on its face says and I'm quoting, "It shall be unlawful for the purposes of this section only and that the Court in the Juneau Spruce case emphasized and stressed that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5289.897" offset="21262921">Secondly, that rather than being weighed against the position of petitioners before this Court, it supports us because it shows that where Congress wished to afford rights to private parties under the Act, they knew how to provide them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5308.295" offset="21336586">And that when they wished to provide rights to private parties, they called out only these specific items, put them in Section 303, and as this Court has noted, and said, “You can have these private rights.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5323.655" offset="21398026">And we submit certainly rather than arguing that all private rights exist under the Act, the 303 argument will support our contention that having so limited and specifically stated for the purpose of this section only that you certainly cannot argue that 303 supports the contentions of respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="5344.464" offset="21481200">Now, further, with respect to Mr. Plant's contention that the decision of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Deena case where on the same day it said, "We affirm the order of the Board and we affirm the order of the Court," created a conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="5360.827" offset="21546715">We believe that the very statement in the Juneau Spruce indicate that Congress purposely stated we are going to proscribe two separate types of remedies (1) the Board and (2) we're going to restrict the wide broad discretion of the Board and provide private remedies and of necessity, where Congress purposely gave two forums the same subject matter upon which to act, then inconsistency might result.</text>
            <text syncTime="5392.717" offset="21674193">But in this case, Congress has confined to one forum, the ability to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5398.455" offset="21697181">Now, we --</text>

            <text syncTime="5405.199" offset="21724139">In other words, not only in this case but in this type of case, whether -- and forgetting for the moment Guss, as you said affirming this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5417.684" offset="21774085">Putting that to one side for the moment, compares that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5421.561" offset="21789654">In this case, in this very case or in this type of case, namely where the Board refused to take hold in accordance to this administrative restriction, self imposed, the administrative restriction, than you'll ever have a conflict.</text>

            <text syncTime="5445.981" offset="21887248">This is not a case where the Board refused to take jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5449.407" offset="21901040">And as the footnote to the original decision will show, the failure to exhaust administrative remedies was reserved in the first Garmon case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5456.706" offset="21930193">And as we stated before, we believe that question is still before the Court at this time, namely, can a person simply file a petition for representation, have it rejected and thereafter, do nothing so that he can escape the state courts to get damage actions?</text>
            <text syncTime="5472.891" offset="21994977">But with respect to the particular issue you raised, we wish to know that in this case as we stated the facts to the Court, it may well be that this was coercion by the employer against the employees to prevent them from being unionized.</text>
            <text syncTime="5491.426" offset="22069060">And so we would have a state court awarding damages against the union where the employer had itself violated a protected right, which under certainly a National Act, should not only have been privileged but should have been protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="5506.043" offset="22127574">And so you have the unique result that assuming that the Board would not take jurisdiction either of a representation case or of an unfair labor practice case from either side, the Court could then be granting relief to an employer where in fact the Board would have disciplined the employer and we think --</text>
