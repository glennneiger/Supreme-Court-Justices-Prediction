            <text syncTime="531.647" offset="2230000">The stacking would be done in -- in various piles of packages one on top of the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="562.128" offset="2351835">The City of Algoma in May 1, 1955, levied a tax on the -- both the lumber and veneer that were located in the storage yard and in the warehouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.397" offset="2408991">They, of course, also levied a tax upon that part of the imported goods both in and out of their packages which were in the factory itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.371" offset="2444831">Though those -- that assessment as to the property that was in the factory whether in or out of the package is not involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.520" offset="2473462">It was not contested.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.070" offset="2479626">We deal here only with the assessment on the lumber and veneers in the storage yard and in the warehouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.583" offset="2505749">The total value of the goods found on that date worth $288,593 and they were as such that $144,296.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.463" offset="2553187">The ratio of assessment to true value in the City of Algoma in 1955 was 100% and the reason they were assessed at 50% of their true market value, in this case, was on the ground that the assessor determined that one-half of the veneers on hand were currently operationally required by the petitioner in this case for its manufacturing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.396" offset="2677008">The petitioner objected at every stage of the proceedings until the assessment on these goods on the ground that it was in violation of Clause 2 of Section 10 of Article I of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.842" offset="2738761">The case ultimately, after a hearing before a Board of Review, reached the Circuit Court for Kewaunee County which is the court of original jurisdiction of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.511" offset="2781393">And there, the position of the City was that the goods were currently operationally, necessary to the extent of half of what was on hand and hence, came within an exception indicated in Hooven &amp; Allison versus Evatt, to the original package rule, or the rule of the Brown case.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.923" offset="2879091">Now, the assessor, in this instance, determined what was taxable according to the findings below by an observation of what the methods of the petitioner were with respect to the use of its imported goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.844" offset="2958712">The testimony was that he knew how much in value, the petitioner had on hand in its warehouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.827" offset="2990686">He observed the removal of goods from the warehouse to the factory.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.559" offset="3009599">The arrival of goods to the warehouse from the foreign shipment and that it was his opinion that one-half of the goods were required to be kept on hand, to meet the current operational needs of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.349" offset="3072815">The Circuit Court for Kewaunee County sustained that conclusion by the assessor, taking the position that the amount of such goods which could be included within the assessment were not unlimited to the immediate needs of the petitioner in the factory, in the manufacturing operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.011" offset="3171453">And concluding with the portion so included were -- was taken out of the stream of commerce and had come to rest in the plant of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.185" offset="3220146">There, to a practical certainty, to be used in its manufacturing process and not reshipped in the original form or packaging.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.736" offset="3250343">And hence, because it was so highly improbable that it would again be sold and transported in commerce that it will become a part of the commoness of property in the State and could be taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.455" offset="3293184">As to the lumber, the trial court found that the assessor would have been justified in taxing it all, going to taxed only half on the current operational needs fairly, because it had been subjected to manufacture by reason of it having been stacked in the storage yard to take advantage of air-drying which took place between the time it was stored there and ultimately taken into the factory for manufacture.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.238" offset="3396315">This was a suit for a refund, so it did not affect the determination at all, but it indicated that the Court would've gone private in the assumption in that respect.</text>
