            <label>Mr. William Simon</label>
            <text syncTime="5.219" offset="124217">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.573" offset="137697">In the case of fabric shops, patterns are but a means to the end and the end is the sale of fabrics which are the business of the fabric shops.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.533" offset="189524">Fabric shops generally have a substantial area of their place of business devoted to the sale of patterns.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.596" offset="217736">As the Hearing Examiner found, they invite the women to come in and sit and browse through the pattern catalogues in the hope that when they find a pattern that suits their taste, it will generate a fabric sale, but fabrics to the things they want to sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.551" offset="289625">The Red Fronts or 10-cent stores on the other hand sell pattens wholly on their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.922" offset="315016">The evidence is they won't carry patterns unless they can sell them at a profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.906" offset="334973">And they devote just a small little space on the counter big enough for one catalogue.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.683" offset="354095">A woman stands there and stumps through the catalogue until she finds the pattern she wants, and then the clerk reaches under the counter and hands her -- her pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.676" offset="394115">And when a woman has purchased a pattern in a Red Front store, there is just one thing she can do it, and that's go to some fabric shop and buy some fabric with which to make a dress.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.650" offset="445942">These are the findings of the Hearing Examiner which were later adopted by the Commission, and I quote from page 222 and 223 of the record, “It is quite true that stores of the two groups approach the sale of patterns from widely different view points and that their methods of selling the patterns also differs substantially.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.136" offset="539878">With the 10-cent stores, patterns are handled as any other item of merchandise.”</text>

            <label>Mr. William Simon</label>
            <text syncTime="127.278" offset="612498">-- that the two -- that stores in the two groups approached the sale of patterns from widely different view points that their methods of selling the patterns also differ substantially.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.022" offset="651473">With the 10-cent stores, patterns are handled as any other item of merchandise, that is patterns must stand on their own feet and show a profit, otherwise the store will not handle them.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.317" offset="688671">The patterns are usually kept in a cabinet under the counter and the only thing the perspective customer sees is the catalogue which is a lot of small space on the counter.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.966" offset="723257">No use is made of respondent's monthly fashion previews or any other advertising material.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.712" offset="746245">The situation is quite different with the yardgood store.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.992" offset="763382">Usually, it does not make any profit on patterns nor does it expect to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.073" offset="787623">It handles patterns to promote the sale of fabrics and because its customers expect this service.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.214" offset="820224">The patterns, catalogue, fashion previous and other advertising material are prominently displayed and the customers are invited to sit and browse through the material all in order to create fabric sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.482" offset="881351">The record evidence is that something like 90% of the cost of making a garment is in the fabric.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.433" offset="909145">Now, the other costs include the buttons and the accessories and a minor cost for the pattern, but 90% of it is the cost of the fabric.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.443" offset="945194">Three of the Commission's six fabric store witnesses testified they'd like to have a Red Front on either side of them selling fabrics because that would generate selling patterns -- excuse me, so long as they didn't sell fabrics because that would generate fabric sales and two more of the Commission's witnesses said, “We don't regard Woolworth as our competitors because they don't sell fabrics.”</text>
            <text syncTime="231.872" offset="1030875">And one of those men said, “When she buys a pattern in a Woolworth store, she might come to me to buy for fabrics.”</text>
            <text syncTime="241.535" offset="1069537">In addition to the things that we do for the Red Fronts and Mr. West from this morning named four things that we do for the Red Fronts, the catalogues, the cabinets, the transportation, the initial inventory and there are other things that were charged in the complaint that we also do for the Red Fronts.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.981" offset="1139336">But significantly, most of the alleged differential treatment was charged by the Commission as a violation of count one were they conceded they had the proving through the competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.806" offset="1190640">And in their brief in this Court on page 4 of the first brief and page 9 of the second brief, they expressly say that 75% of the total differentials were charged under count one.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.261" offset="1248423">This morning, Mr. West told you that Woolworth has a $1,800,000 worth of inventory.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.614" offset="1269844">That was charged under count one, in spite of the fact that 75% of the differentials were charged under count one including the major items he mentioned this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.700" offset="1310177">That count was dismissed because of the affirmative finding of knowing through the competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.890" offset="1334941">And this record shows that we do even more for the fabric shops than we do for the Red Fronts although they are different items.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.797" offset="1370572">Simplicity spends a half a million dollars a year promoting home sowing in the economics departments of the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.754" offset="1402337">They have a core of women who tour the country calling on home economics teachers and promoting home sowing and these women coordinate their work with the local fabric merchant.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.096" offset="1443715">So as to introduce him to this youth market were girls are acquiring the habit of home sowing.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.547" offset="1473599">The company sends free to 40,000 home economics teachers a monthly -- a magazine periodically devoted to promoting home sowing.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.156" offset="1516022">They have a nationwide 4-H program devoted to promoting home sowing.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.042" offset="1539532">The company spends $200,000 a year in sending fashion posters and fashion design material to these fabric stores and this don't portray the pattern, they portray the finished dress that it's hoped the women will see in the store of the window and come in and buy the ingredients, most of which is fabrics to make that dress.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.480" offset="1629288">And finally, from six to 10 times a year, they send to these fabric merchants from New York throughout the country the latest style information on women's fashions and women's designs of new dresses.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.582" offset="1677667">And these are used by the fabric merchants to promote the sale of fabrics which is what they're really interested in.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.318" offset="1704626">In these matters, the company spends more than a million dollars a year, none of it is charged to the fabric merchants.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.804" offset="1742555">If permitted to do so and the Court of Appeals reversed because we had not been permitted to do so, we can readily prove that not -- the -- as Mr. Weston said, the small fabric merchants get the short-end of the stick.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.484" offset="1797308">We can prove they get the long-end of the stick because we spend more on what we do for them than what we do for the Red Fronts and if the Commission --</text>

            <text syncTime="473.172" offset="1996048">Our women who go to the schools and promote home sowing in the economics department at the schools, they bring the local fabric merchant over by the hand and introduce them and promote them.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.994" offset="2035336">The Red Fronts stores don't even have personnel that they can send to a school to coordinate these promotional activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.373" offset="2064906">We give them these large fashion posters which we spend $200,000 a year on the Red Fronts use, and they're helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.666" offset="2090088">The 10-cent stores have no place for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.124" offset="2099911">Now, granted that many of the things we do have a benefit that applies to anybody who carry Simplicity patterns.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.064" offset="2131675">But the great bulk of this home sowing program, particularly the fashion material, the design material, promotes the sale of fabrics in the fabric stores and isn't used and in the very nature of their operation couldn't be used by the 10-cent stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.699" offset="2206177">Might I, at this point, Mr. Justice Stewart, elaborate on the answer of Mr. Weston gave you to the question this morning as to whether we had 6000 customers whom we sold at a -- a loss, and he said that was hard to believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.029" offset="2267512">The record evidence, however, is that the Commission lawyer asked the president of Simplicity this question which appears at page 232 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.996" offset="2303352">Question, “You testified earlier that your company had 6000 accounts selling $400 a year or less and they were unprofitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.425" offset="2345044">Have you eliminated any of them?”</text>
            <text syncTime="562.304" offset="2352567">Answer, “We have not eliminated any of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.782" offset="2366464">We have never eliminated a customer who has paid his bills whether he has been profitable or unprofitable in the years I have been president of this company.”</text>
            <text syncTime="575.664" offset="2406066">And then at page 284, the same witness in response to another question by Commission counsel said, “And now, we have always thought of ourselves as the common denominator in the pattern business and that is that we sell our patterns at the lowest possible price for the best possible value and it is to our interest to have Simplicity available in every place that is reasonable for it to be sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.727" offset="2506271">If we can get as popular as Wrigley chewing gum or Coca-Cola, so much the better.”</text>
            <text syncTime="606.113" offset="2527796">And finally on 286, Commission counsel asked him.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.382" offset="2540857">Question, “Well, anyway, you got your start with the small stores.”</text>
            <text syncTime="614.357" offset="2560815">Answer, “Yes, sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="616.193" offset="2568129">Question, “And now, you wouldn't want to be kind of like a man that gets tired of its wife and cast her off, would you?”</text>
            <text syncTime="623.530" offset="2597491">Answer, “I certainly would not, sir, and that is straight unequivocal.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.827" offset="2614732">As long as a small merchant conforms to the normal business practices or paying his bills and has a store open, he is going to get service from Simplicity Pattern Company unless it is made impossible for me to do so.”</text>
            <text syncTime="641.942" offset="2671156">There is an advantage to this company in having the widest distribution of its patterns and it does so serving 6000 stores at a loss.</text>

            <text syncTime="829.428" offset="3421080">What each group gets that which is best suited to their own needs and what the Commission is charging here would be anomalous to charging that a seller discriminated when he gave suits to men and dresses to women because each group wasn't given the same that the other group was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.988" offset="3499342">In this case, the complaint for procedural purposes was divided into two counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.424" offset="3525047">Count one was brought under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act charging an unfair method of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.127" offset="3551901">But throughout the proceedings, it was conceded that it was analogous to a charge of price discrimination under Section 2 (a) of the Robinson-Patman Act, both the Examiner and the Commission applied the standards of 2 (a) of the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.335" offset="3608743">And as I said a moment ago, some 75% of the total dollar value discriminations were charged under count one of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.162" offset="3648031">We did not dispute that certain services, certain benefits were given in one group and not given to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.634" offset="3669870">The issue litigated before the Commission as whether there was injury to competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.958" offset="3687215">And at the close of the administrative hearing, the Hearing Examiner dismissed count one on the ground that the evidence showed an absence of probable competitive injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.799" offset="3730578">But as to count two, he said that it was a per se statute and that it was not necessary to show any adverse competitive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.264" offset="3776449">The Hearing Examiner adopted his findings and his conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.889" offset="3798915">And I think it's important here to note that before the Commission, commission counsel argued the entire group of discriminations as a single package and he reached this 25% aggregate discrimination by combining discriminations of count one and of count two, and saying they were 25% and that proved injury to competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.186" offset="3892120">The Commission disagreed and dismissed the count where the bulk of discriminations occurred on the ground of no injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.497" offset="3929318">We say that the Commission's order should be set aside for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.410" offset="3948962">First, that there is no competition between these two groups of customers on the Commission's own findings of fact and the law as established by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.513" offset="3989400">And secondly, that under the proviso under the clause in the first half of Subsection 2 (b), we are permitted the affirmative defense of showing an absence of competitive injury which the Commission here found and under the same subsection, we are permitted the defense of cost justification which the Commission denied as the opportunity to present.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.746" offset="4082395">In the Automatic Canteen case, this Court held and the Commission has never disputed that this statute is not a model of clarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.681" offset="4122102">It contains six subsections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.830" offset="4134640">Subsection (e) relates to buyer liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.229" offset="4148328">Subsection (b) contains the affirmative defenses and (a), (c), (d) and (e) contained prohibitions against seller conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.680" offset="4190124">Subsection (a) makes it unlawful for a seller to discriminate in price in the course of interstate commerce where the effect may be substantially to lessen competition and where the discrimination is not justified by differences in the cost of sale, manufacture or delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.402" offset="4276955">Subsection (c) has nothing to do with discrimination at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.718" offset="4294196">It is the only one of these statutes that is violated even though you give every customer the same treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.638" offset="4321886">It places a ban on the payment of brokerage to the buyer or the buyer's agent and presumably was intended to protect the broker, and it is violated even though every customer gets equal brokerage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.122" offset="4379878">Subsection (d) prohibits payment of allowances for promotional or advertising activities to one customer which are not made available on proportionately equal terms to all competing customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.576" offset="4433690">And subsection (e), the one here at issue prohibits discrimination and services to our facilities not made available to all customers on proportionately equal terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.452" offset="4477158">Now, the Commission argues here that you must take each of these four subsections and treat them an isolation and that you will not consider anyone of the other three subsections in determining the scope of anyone of the four.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.373" offset="4528880">But at the outset, they are met by the facts that the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held and they don't disagree, there is no reference in subsection 2 (e) to interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.227" offset="4572244">The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that we will read in from 2 (a) the interstate commerce provision to save the constitutionality of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.132" offset="4607875">There is also no provision in 2 (e) that the customers discriminated against must be in competition with each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.352" offset="4636818">The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in the Corn Products case, which was later affirmed by this Court, held that 2 (e) was violated only where the discrimination was between competing customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.010" offset="4687391">And the Commission in his brief here concedes that you will read in 2 -- 2 (e) the competition requirement of 2 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.132" offset="4731904">It says at page 11 of its second brief, and I quote, “Subsection 2 (d) is expressly limited to inequality between customers competing in the distribution of such products or commodities.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.673" offset="4798046">The two subsection are complementary to each other and there is no evidence that Congress intended 2 (e) to be broader in scope than 2 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.374" offset="4852903">Now, conceding that the statute has violated only if these two groups were in competition, we say that the hearing examiner's findings as to the nature of the business of each of these two groups and what he said about the testimony shows that they were not in competition with each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.608" offset="4929808">At page 24 of the record, the Hearing Examiner found and this finding was later adopted by the Commission, about the middle of the page, “They,” meaning the fabric store witnesses, “emphasized that they all handled patterns only to sell fabrics and because their customers expect the service”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.798" offset="5010578">None of the witnesses regards the competition of the 10-cent store in the sale of patterns has of any real consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.808" offset="5038582">In fact, two of the witnesses did not regard themselves as being in competition with the 10-cent store at all, while these two expressions of opinion are, of course, not conclusive on the fundamental question of the existence of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.804" offset="5102634">They served to emphasize the apparent feeling of all the witnesses that they are sustaining no substantial competitive injury as the result of a more favorable treatment accorded the 10-cent stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.796" offset="5154565">The record seems clearly to be without any substantial evidence warranting a finding of injury to competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.825" offset="5190719">And in another part of his findings which appears at page 294 of the record, the Hearing Examiner found, and I quote at the top of the page, “The attitude of the witnesses, that is to say the smaller merchants who have testified in this case, seemed to be about this,” and then I'm skipping a sentence, “They would like all of those things as well as the other items mentioned in the complaint but none of the witnesses seemed to attach any real significance or importance to any of those things.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.613" offset="5309837">No witness comes in complaining about any of these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.662" offset="5326033">It would seem to me it would be a rather strange situation for the Federal Trade Commission to undertake to give relief to a group of merchants who apparently do not need any relief, that is to say they are indifferent about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1328.013" offset="5415476">The Commission's definition of competition here is at variants with any definition of competition in an antitrust action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.363" offset="5452779">Conceding that there's no rivalry between these people, they defined competition at page 12 of their second brief vastly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.287" offset="5488515">In our view, however, that test is satisfied by the facts that the two kinds of stores sell the same commodity to the same class of customers in the same area and no other proof of competitive rivalry is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.528" offset="5561448">We say in an antitrust case that there must be competitive rivalry before you can find competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.536" offset="5589556">The Commission says this is a per se statute, if you give them ones the service you don't give it to the other, it's per se illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.773" offset="5618500">And then they have a per se definition of competition, if you're both selling the same thing in the same community, you're in competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.768" offset="5646399">But this Court in a case dealing with the same statute, Section 7 of the Clayton Act, and this is Section 2 of the Clayton Act, in the International Shoe case held that competition in the Clayton Act met substantial competition and that it did not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.678" offset="5710033">At least Section 7 did not apply to competition which was not substantial or of consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.077" offset="5739708">I'm impressed by the fact that we relied upon that case in our opening brief and it has not been mentioned by the Commission in their reply brief although my good friend Charles Weston was also counsel for the Government in the International Shoe case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.928" offset="5799058">In addition to the Commission's findings of no rivalry, which we say is a matter of law, under the Shoe case means no competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.596" offset="5833749">The ruling of this Court in the Morton Salt case compels a similar conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.013" offset="5855378">And the Commission here confesses error before this Court on this point, although we are not in agreement as to what is the error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.791" offset="5886516">They concede that under Morton Salt, a substantial price difference, and it was 4% in that case, to competing customers is equated to competitive injury under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.268" offset="5936462">We argue a fortiori a 25% discrimination which is expressly found not to have a probable adverse competitive effect, must necessarily be between customers who are not in competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.464" offset="5993200">The Commission says our theory is right and if there was any error, it was in their not finding an injury to competition under count one and that they should have found that the 25% differential did result in an injury to competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.601" offset="6057775">But I submit to this Court that that was the very issue litigated below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.140" offset="6075956">That was the very issue to which all the testimony was directed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.480" offset="6089331">And in their argument before the Commission, commission counsel said, “This 25% differential is so big, you must find injury to competition.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.462" offset="6137187">The Commission rejected that argument.And they said at page 29 of the record in the Commission's own opinion in the middle of the page, “The substance of the argument made seems to be that the total value of the preferences granted to the 10-cent stores were of such substantial percentage of the purchases that they create a presumption of competitive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.385" offset="6236871">And then at the first of the following paragraph they say, “As appealing as this argument may be, it is clear that under the circumstances, the mere showing of discrimination among customers is not allowed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.960" offset="6283264">And may I point out that that finding isn't before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.679" offset="6298102">No appeal was taken and in fact no appeal could be taken by the Commission from its own finding of adverse competitive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.838" offset="6326732">And if it is conceded that the finding of no competitive injury cannot stand side by side with the finding of competition then since one finding has not been brought to this Court, it must that the latter finding must fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.779" offset="6398516">But apart from that technical point, the Commission itself adjudicated this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.594" offset="6417742">It was litigated and they found no competitive injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.450" offset="6441148">With respect to the defenses based on the language of Section 2 (b), I would like to say initially that we do not urge that the proviso of 2 (a) must be read into 2 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.224" offset="6516276">The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the Elizabeth Arden case held that that was not required, and we do not contend otherwise.</text>

            <text syncTime="1615.913" offset="6567058">But we do contend that the language of Section 2 (b) contains a bridge which when you read the entire statute makes clear that there is an affirmative defense and we concede the burden is on us to prove the absence of competitive injury or cost justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.055" offset="6651591">We concede the Commission made out a prima facie case by merely showing the different treatment to the competing customers, but 2 (b) in clear language gives us this affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.766" offset="6710418">And there are three factors that, to me, illustrate the merit of our position and the weakness of the Commission's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.670" offset="6746049">The Commission said if there's price discrimination, then it's a defense to show cost justification, it's a defense to show no injury to competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.772" offset="6786487">But it if it's price -- if it's service discrimination, those defenses aren't unavailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.644" offset="6805922">Therefore, had Simplicity given the Red Fronts a price reduction of an exactly equal amount to the value of these cabinets and catalogues, the Commission would say, “You're free.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.029" offset="6851480">In fact, they would then have been under count one which was dismissed.We would have no liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.372" offset="6872900">But while it would be proper for us to give them a price reduction of the same value, the Commission says it's per se unlawful to give them the same value if you put a label of services and facilities on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.136" offset="6939878">Secondly, the 2 (b) Section contains two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.202" offset="6964224">The first part reads in terms of justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.291" offset="6980524">It says, “The seller may justify.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.345" offset="6992750">The second part reads in terms of excuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.464" offset="7009259">The second part says, “If you have violated this impact, if you created competitive injury, if you can't cost justify, you may still excuse your violation by showing that you were meeting the services and facilities of a competitor.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.579" offset="7077700">It seems to us unthinkable that Congress would say, “You don't have the right to justify this action by showing that nobody was injured, that there was cost justification, but you do have the right to excuse and even though there was injury and was no cost justification.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.871" offset="7150843">And thirdly, we can conceive of no reason why Congress should treat price discrimination so very differently than service or facilities discrimination without there being some reason why Congress thought one was more iniquitous than the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="1808.613" offset="7337775">Mr. Weston gave three points this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.627" offset="7349896">The first of which was substantially what Your Honor has said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.901" offset="7366928">I don't see how it's any easier to hide service discrimination than it is to send customer's rebate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.334" offset="7396707">There are many cases in the books where a big buyer is charged $10 a dozen for the commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.924" offset="7419068">He gets a $10 dozen bill and then at the end of the year, they give him back the rebate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.237" offset="7436309">That's a common thing and yet that's difficult to please.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.294" offset="7452505">There was no dispute about the facts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.974" offset="7463267">Mr. Weston added that it is more difficult to measure the value of service discrimination, price discrimination you measure it easily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.498" offset="7501406">He said it was more difficult to measure the value of service discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.159" offset="7520005">Our answer to that is that this is an affirmative burden imposed on us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.051" offset="7535574">If we can't measure it, we don't prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.739" offset="7550307">Mr. Weston also says -- said that it was more difficult to measure injury to competition resulting from service discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.274" offset="7584475">But again, that's a burden on us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.475" offset="7593253">If we can't meet that burden, we lose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.744" offset="7606314">And finally, he said it would make it more difficult to try the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.406" offset="7621047">And of course, I concur in that when you make anything a per se violation, the Government can try its case in two or three minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.935" offset="7651140">But in an antitrust case, it seems to me that the cardinal objective of the statutes and of the Court's interpretation should be to protect and preserve competition and where something is done which is competitively healthy, it seems inconsistent to me to deny the legality of it merely because of the label which attaches to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.854" offset="7750823">In fact, in the Motion Picture Advertising case which was another Federal Trade Commission case involving a sister statute in an opinion of this Court by Mr. Justice Douglas this Court said referring to the anti-trust cases, “The crucial fact is the impact of a particular practice on competition not the label it carries.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.097" offset="7843715">And we submit here the Commission makes the crucial fact of the label.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.891" offset="7858970">If you call it service, then these defenses aren't available.</text>

            <text syncTime="1972.224" offset="7992299">And there, they were contending that they didn't strictly come within the letter of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.887" offset="8014869">And this Court said, “It isn't the label that carries, it's the impact of the practice on competition.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.333" offset="8056665">The Commission has referred here to the legislative history as supporting their view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.255" offset="8080384">We say the legislative history is exactly to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.856" offset="8098774">As Mr. Weston said the Robinson bill was introduced in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.010" offset="8115388">The Patman bill was introduced in the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.378" offset="8128867">The Senate bill was reported out with no 2 (b) provision in it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.447" offset="8149138">The Patman bill was reported out in the House with a 2 (b) provision like the present one except that it did not mention services or facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.287" offset="8188531">On the floor of the Senate, the 2 (b) amendment, as it now appears, was offered and accepted by the sponsor and the House then added services and facilities to its bill in order to conform to what the Senate had done and both bills were then alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.047" offset="8259584">To me, the most significant fact is that Senator Robinson certainly didn't think he was changing the purposes of the bill by expressly saying, “You can justify discrimination and services and facilities,” because they thought that could be done under the bill without the provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.900" offset="8342967">Both the Senate and the House reports on this legislation under a section entitled “Analysis of the Bill” contain a paragraph which is verbatim identical except for the first two or three words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.404" offset="8400959">The Senate bill on page 3 of the report it starts out by saying, “The bill proposes to amend Section 2.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.665" offset="8438053">The House bill starts -- the House report, which is on page 7 of the report starts out, “The object of the bill briefly stated is to amend Section 2.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.166" offset="8476087">From thereon, both reports are identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.056" offset="8487581">And this is what they say, “The bill proposes to amend Section 2 of the Clayton Act so as to suppress more effectively discriminations between customers of the same seller, not supported by sound economic differences in their business' position or in the cost of serving them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.489" offset="8581308">Such discriminations are sometimes affected directly in prices or terms of sale and sometimes by separate allowances to favored customers for purported services or other considerations which are unjustly discriminatory in their result against other customers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.973" offset="8667303">The bill is accordingly drawn in four subsections of which the first three contains substantive measures directed at the more prevalent terms of discrimination, while the fourth is designed to facilitate private remedies and damages to persons immediately and actually injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.898" offset="8738983">Significantly there, they didn't talk about price discrimination when they said, “The bill didn't prohibit discriminations which were justified by economic differences.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.799" offset="8778585">They talked about discriminations and then they made it crystal clear that it wasn't limited to price discriminations by saying that these discriminations are sometimes in price and sometimes in these other matters.</text>

            <text syncTime="2650.757" offset="10706422">And the Court of Appeals, while disagreeing with us on the law on that point, did agree with us on the fact that there was affirmative finding of no injury to competition.</text>

            <label>Mr. William Simon</label>
            <text syncTime="2712.121" offset="10951868">The statutory language, Mr. Justice Black, is where the effect maybe substantially less than competition or tend to create a monopoly or injure, prevent or destroy competition with the beneficiary of the discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.096" offset="11011741">That, I think verbatim, is the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.286" offset="11024488">And when the Examiner and the Commission used competitive injury, I think it was a shorthand phrase for that longer statutory phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.765" offset="11074435">If I may get back to the point discussed before the recess, this Court has held in many cases that wherever possible, every phrase, every clause, every provision of a statute will be given meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.798" offset="11146533">The Commission's position here frankly requires you to read out of the statute the first clause of subsection 2 (b) and that clause clearly was not limited to price discrimination because the Congress expressly talked about discrimination and service as their facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.709" offset="11230229">It appears at page 26 of the Commission's first brief, at the middle of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.478" offset="11269308">I might say that the second half of the paragraph beginning with the “provided” relates to the meeting competition defense which was before this Court in Standard Oil versus Federal Trade Commission but which is not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.077" offset="11319672">But the first clause says “Upon proof being made at any hearing on a complaint under this section that there has been discrimination in price or services or facilities furnished, the burden of rebutting the prima facie case does made by showing justification shall be on the person charged with a violation of this section and unless justification shall be affirmatively shown, the Commission is authorized to issue an order.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.983" offset="11451329">Congress could not have more clearly said that you may justify a discrimination in services or facilities, yet the Commission says you can't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.115" offset="11487796">The Commission says there is no justification for a discrimination in services or facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.994" offset="11511306">They said the only way you can avoid liability is by showing, meaning competition, which is expressly provided for in the lower half.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.771" offset="11546415">If the justification is to be given some meaning, and we submit that it must be given meaning, we suggest three places the Court might look to determine the criteria of such meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.036" offset="11603466">The first is in the overall statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.420" offset="11617050">What was Congress trying to get at it in the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.459" offset="11629171">And we look to Section 2 (a) and we find that Congress said, “We don't mean to prohibit price discriminations where they are cost justified or where there is no probability of competitive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.326" offset="11684655">And we read the justification clause of 2 (b) as applying to the things Congress talked about in 2 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.015" offset="11719450">The difference is that in 2 (a), injury to competition is made a part of the Commission's prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.202" offset="11744214">They must prove it there, but in 2 (b), Congress said, “These matters of justification are an affirmative defense of the seller.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.052" offset="11779532">Secondly, we would suggest looking to the legislative history to see what Congress had in mind and the committee reports, particularly the quotation that I read a few moments ago, make clear that they were not intending to prevent discriminations either price or services which were justified by economic differences between the parties or by cross differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.024" offset="11871483">In fact, this Court has said in the Automatic Canteen case referring to this very statute, and I quote from the Court's opinion, “Time and again, there was recognition in Congress of a freedom to adapt and pass on to buyers the benefits of more economical processes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.164" offset="11956015">And that's exactly what we urged here, the right to pass on these benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.929" offset="11979107">On the subject of cost justification, I would like to refer to the fact that the evidence is that two people in the company's office handled all of the correspondents in details with all of the chain stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.058" offset="12027591">80% of the personnel are devoted to the work with the fabric shops.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.401" offset="12049011">The company has a core salesman whose salary and expense accounts amount to $20,000 a year who calls on the fabric shops.</text>

            <text syncTime="3105.570" offset="12525693">They say that we can take these very unprofitable customers who are already losing money on but we want to serve if we can and we can make them even more unprofitable by giving them free cabinets and free catalogues even though the business doesn't justify.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.178" offset="12588074">And presumably, if their decision is to be rationalized, we must also give the Red Fronts these expensive posters if they have no place to put and don't care for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.360" offset="12628825">Or secondly, the Commission says, “You can give up the Red Fronts,” because the evidence here is that if the Red Fronts had to pay for all these services, they couldn't make a profit and they wouldn't carry the patterns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.150" offset="12671979">And if we did that, the fabric stores would be injured because a diminution in patterns they have -- would hurt us but it would hurt the fabric stores a lot more because the Red Fronts do not sell yard goods and when the woman buys the pattern in a Red Front, she's got to go to some fabric store to get her fabrics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.949" offset="12751182">Or thirdly, the Commission says, “You can give up doing business with these unprofitable fabrics stores and don't sell them at all.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.171" offset="12780022">And we submit that neither of those alternatives is in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.334" offset="12804681">I would like to conclude, if I may, by, again, referring to the Motion Picture Advertising case where the Court said that in an antitrust case, “The crucial fact was the impact of the particular practice on competition and not the label it carries.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.376" offset="12868838">And the Commission concedes that their whole case here is dependent on giving this the label, services and facilities.</text>
