            <text syncTime="7.128" offset="28421">The one issue that is raised is the desirability of encouraging as a policy in our republican form of government, the contributions to political parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.965" offset="95817">This is of course a major problem with both political parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.677" offset="114625">It is estimated that as much as $40,000 is needed to elect a Congressman.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.288" offset="145136">If we are to have a representative form of government, we can't limit the representatives as -- the Congressman to persons who are able to afford that, so that we do agree that it is proper to encourage contributions to political parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.904" offset="215562">Both major parties have endeavored to broaden the base so that the contributions will come more from the actual person's representatives numerically, but I'm quite sure that neither major party, no matter how great this problem would want to encourage the -- this method of obtaining money for political parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.361" offset="337398">In other words, I believe the policy is not applicable where you're -- apply it to a fact situation of selling or buying public office.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.010" offset="380029">And that this was the purpose of Congress setting forth this policy of the country that this is one way in which money is not to be raised for political parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="126.543" offset="506149">Then, I say, we come into that area where there is a certain amount of faith placed in the processes of the law, and the District Attorney and the judges, and the juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.406" offset="549616">I think that perhaps the best illustration of its working, day in and day out isn't the main act where we have a very general provision that any person who takes a female across a state line for immoral purposes and that is a broad term, and yet, as it is used and exercised, it is limited largely to commercialization, the overreaching of children, female children of tender years.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.566" offset="666227">But it is capable of all sorts of interpretations of what is an immoral purpose and for that reason, I say that this falls, not because it would not be a thing of value, but because in the processes in carrying out criminal law, there has to be some faith placed in the offices of the prosecuting judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="212.600" offset="850338">And we believe that it is in the solicitation section as an additional word to define or give color to a thing of value because they anticipated this difficulty arising more specifically with the solicitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.615" offset="918361">The solicitor is saying, “If you will make a contribution of $10,000 to the party, I'll support you for this job.”</text>
            <text syncTime="236.655" offset="946573">And then later, the solicitor is saying that this was not the sale of an office but a legitimate political activity and they aimed that section at a specific hazard which they've had testimony on.</text>

            <text syncTime="271.533" offset="1086067">There is no explanation that I could find as to why it was put in one section and not in the other, no discussion of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.896" offset="1119504">As we point out, this is -- this is not unique in these two sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.017" offset="1139984">In our brief, we pointed out at least two other instances where in this same chapter, between bribery and graft, that there is a difference in the language used defining thing of value or not defining it but -- run in with it between the person who solicits and the person who offers.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.046" offset="1228173">And we think this is just the overall attempt of Congress to anticipate some sort of an offer of a thing of value which could not be specific -- specifically spelled out and be safe to cover the whole area that they wish to cover.</text>

            <text syncTime="871.932" offset="3487660">This does not take into account the requirements of the Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure (7)(c), which states that the indictment or information shall be a plain concise and a definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.442" offset="3557669">And when the rule says the essential facts constituting the offense charged, I presume that they mean all of the essential facts constituting the offense charge and not just the selection of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.366" offset="3605420">Now, the Government would have this Court conclude from the fact that we have an offer to donate a $1000 to the Republican Party to use as they see fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.189" offset="3648679">Ipso facto, that is a thing of value to Congressman Stauffer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2513.497" offset="10053904">I suppose it's a common law to bribe a member of the House Of Common, probably it was a common law then to being under the generality of offenses that is inimical to the wellbeing of the cavalry of the kingdom.</text>

            <text syncTime="2526.115" offset="10104372">That may be so, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.986" offset="10107925">I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.899" offset="10119523">In the act in and of itself with which we are dealing, namely the act of making a political contribution assigned for the moment or the purposes for which that act may be done is in of itself laudatory act and while certainly it may be proscribed and certainly under certain conditions, it is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.112" offset="10208444">If that proscription is to be made, it would seem that it should in explicit terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.883" offset="10231432">And the comparison between 18 U.S.C. 214 and 18 U.S.C. 215, the latter in which a section does contain an explicit proscription would seem to indicate that Congress do not intend the proscription of political contributions in the context of 18 U.S.C. 214.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.203" offset="10312725">For these reasons therefore, the defense submit, number one, that the information is insufficient to allege a crime under Title 18 Section 214 United States Code because it does not contain the essential facts necessary to constitute the offense charged and that there is no allegation that a thing of value was offered to Congressman Stauffer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.045" offset="10412095">And secondly, even if it were sufficient, in other words, even if all the essential facts stated were there, the construction placed on the statute by the Government gives two broader meaning to words “thing of value” and gives an inappropriate meaning to the word, “Republican Party”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.373" offset="10489417">Now, I might mention at this point also that the Republican Party is not identified as being in association or a person in the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.361" offset="10533407">And if this offer or if the proscribed offer would be to a retail shoe store, then it must be alleged that it was a retail shoe store in the information and we have no knowledge whatsoever as to the nature of the Republican Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.112" offset="10596415">It is not alleged in the information and on that ground, the information is insufficient aside from the fact that as we argue in our brief, the Republican Party is not an association but rather a concept.</text>
