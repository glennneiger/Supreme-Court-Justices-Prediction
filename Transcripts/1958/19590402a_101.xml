            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="157.147" offset="731930">Well my question was a little broader than that, namely how many were potentially affected and that was turned into hundred or thousand.</text>

            <label>Mr. John G. Laughlin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="164.234" offset="760351">Well certainly, I would agree that that would be quite -- quite true.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.751" offset="782399">By way of summation of my remarks yesterday, I would like to say that unlike the situation in Service v. Dulles and in Cole v. Young, additional removal from federal employment did not violate any procedural right conferred upon him by statute, or in our view, by regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.784" offset="862542">If however, the regulations promulgated by the Department of Interior are deemed applicable to a removal of an at-will employee, then of course our position is that these -- these procedural requirements were strictly complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.791" offset="938506">The only inquiry we feel that might be opened as to the sufficiency of this hearing is to the fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.905" offset="974973">And of course the Court will have available if it deems that this is a necessary inquiry in the case to have available the full hearing and we trust and hope that it isn't all as bad as the excerpts of petitioner's counsel have made it out to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.641" offset="1057938">If we are correct in our position that there was no invalidity as distinguished from a lack of authority, a statutory authority here, in petitioner's removal, then as I said yesterday we think it follows that there is no right to reinstatement in his former position.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.916" offset="1131081">Or another reason we think that there is no present right to that -- to reinstatement because of the personal action which was taken in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.699" offset="1174131">I should say that that notification of petitioner's termination bears the same date as the original notification and purports to affect his termination as of September 10, 1954.</text>

            <label>Mr. John G. Laughlin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="305.873" offset="1326895">I think that that if the 1954 termination be deemed invalid, that the 1956 notification would not validate that removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.964" offset="1407248">Petitioner's reference to the fact that the position formerly occupied by petitioner was converted to the competitive service on April 1st of 1956, in our view and as I think Mr. Justice Frankfurter made clear yesterday, becomes a relevance only in the event that there is a reinstatement of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.118" offset="1511842">That would be an emolument of his office which presumably he would be entitled to, that is to have the High Commissioner of the Trust Territory exercise his discretion and either recommending or not recommending the petitioner for conversion from accepted to competitive status.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.549" offset="1593553">Only in that event, even though that condition has been satisfied, would he be within the classified service so-called and eligible for the procedural protections of the Lloyd-La Follette Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.142" offset="1679966">Well petitioner's main contention in this Court is that he is entailed to reinstatement and in pursuance of that position, he insists that only by reinstating him in his position can the badge of infamy which has been fastened upon him by the 1954 removal be rectified.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.437" offset="1777142">We question whether that is a necessary element of relief and we point to the case of Peters v. Hobby which, as the court knows, was a loyalty case and where a reinstatement could not in the Court's judgment be granted to the petitioner there.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.499" offset="1849344">There of course there was fixed 10 year of employment that had expired at the time of decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.025" offset="1875466">But we think here that because of the status of this particular employee that we have an analogous problem, in the sense that he is and was at all times subject to removal at will and that to reinstate him in these circumstances would not add anything in the way of substantive relief that which is already been administratively accorded to him.</text>

            <text syncTime="911.805" offset="3750640">If the Court please, I would like to spend a few moments on the 56 personnel document.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.805" offset="3782614">As I -- as the record show, there were three documents filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.637" offset="3805915">There was an affidavit -- this appears on the record starting on Page 32.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.803" offset="3838621">There was an affidavit by the personnel officer of the Office of Territories of the Department of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.515" offset="3889403">And it stated that this affidavit accompanied the defendant's opposition to plaintiff's motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.233" offset="3924302">And the posture there taken by the Department of Justice was that this was a expunging of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.457" offset="3957217">Now the affidavit states that the attached form 50, which is the document on Page 33, is a true copy of the official document reflecting the termination of Vitarelli from a position under the jurisdiction of the Office of Trust Territories, and that is all the affidavit states.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.201" offset="4048227">Now the notification of personnel action that's on Page 33 is exactly the same as the documents entitled Notification of Personnel Action on Page 31 except for two particulars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.324" offset="4124714">It omits a sentence and it adds a sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.612" offset="4145821">The sentence that it omits is the sentence that appears at the top of Page 32, the 5th line, “This action is being taken in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 10450.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.101" offset="4211754">That sentence does not appear in the new 56 form 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.887" offset="4238921">The second change is the addition of a sentence appearing on the top of page 34, “This form 50 is a revision of and replaces the original bearing the same date.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.858" offset="4298794">In all other respects the two documents are identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.689" offset="4318124">Now that means that there are two dates on each document, a date appearing after line number four, which in normal personnel practice reflects the date on which the document is prepared.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.527" offset="4373504">In both instances that date is 9/21/54.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.311" offset="4396596">The effective date is line number six, and that's date 9/10/54.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.075" offset="4423659">Now I submit that at the time, this document was prepared under the Department of the Interior, sometime in October 1956, it was -- it purported to be an expunging of the reference to the fact that the earlier document had been taken in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 10450 and was nothing else.</text>

            <text syncTime="1497.809" offset="6094660">I don't think it has any -- in my view the 1956 document means nothing more than they have endeavored partially to comply with our request for an expunging of the record and that alone, and I believe it was on that basis this document was submitted to the district court and used by respondents there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.885" offset="6174908">Now I think this perhaps is further supported by the third document that was submitted in 1956 and that's the document on Page 34, which is an affidavit from the Civil Service Commission, which says that all records of the Commission have been expunged of all adverse findings made with respect to Vitarelli under Executive Order 10450.</text>

            <text syncTime="1601.917" offset="6511052">I think that is easily answered by the text of the Act itself, which is printed in the government's brief, Page 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.535" offset="6561520">And if you look there, after the first italicized proviso, that any employee having a permanent or indefinite appointment, now an indefinite appointment means the person who has an appointment outside the competitive civil service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.164" offset="6628080">And while there may have ben some legislative history to suggest that they wanted additional powers, nonetheless the face of the statute shows that it had application to people in the -- who were not in the competitive civil service so long as their position had some rational relationship with the national security.</text>
