            <text syncTime="13.521" offset="157445">No, Your Honor, I have not.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.306" offset="176567">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.231" offset="184299">Last evening at the recess, I have just completed my demonstration of the manner in which Washington, the State of Washington in a discriminatory manner that does everything possible to destroy the economic incentive of the 4800 retail licensees in that State who are authorized to sell at California as well as the wines of other origins.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.118" offset="295894">I turn now to the matter on which directly affects the interest of the State of California and the cause of action which the State of California has in its own right.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.068" offset="339675">And this has to do with the discriminations practiced by the State of Washington in connection with sales promotion work, having to do, of course, with the sale of wine.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.569" offset="377605">Now, if I may, I would like to define what I mean by sales promotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.415" offset="393070">I am not talking about advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.293" offset="404564">By advertising, I mean the use of newspapers and other printed media, television, radio for advertising purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.795" offset="442598">By sales promotion, I mean essentially, personal contact work with prospective buyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.325" offset="468720">I mean the dissemination of product information in such form that it can be used in retail stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.248" offset="500381">This product information is sometimes known in this trade as point of sale material, graphic sales aids, posters, displays, bottle holders, racks for the display of merchandise.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.280" offset="560462">It also -- wine being of the nature that it is, it also includes such things as wine selection charts, showing the proper use or the preferred use of various types of wine.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.605" offset="609782">And it also because wine is -- is used to a large extent in cooking, it also includes recipe books and that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.001" offset="643427">Now, so far as Washington wine is concerned, the State of Washington places no limitation on sales promotion activity on behalf of the sale of Washington wine.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.980" offset="683342">But with respect to California wine, again, Washington law is completely merciless in the flatness of its prohibition against sales promotion work on behalf of California wine.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.406" offset="732975">And again, because this discrimination is so apparent on the face of the statutes of the State and the regulations of the State Liquor Board, I should like to read a brief excerpt.</text>

            <text syncTime="2701.110" offset="10907773">Washington by statute and regulations confined, first of all, it's a monopoly State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.358" offset="10936822">All liquor is involved with the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.157" offset="10960018">Hard liquor, if I might use that expression, distilled spirits have to be sold through a state monopoly store.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.397" offset="10992933">Beer can be sold anywhere without regard to the state monopoly store.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.485" offset="11025324">The statutes make a distinction on domestic and non-domestic wine.Domestic wine can be sold directly through a wholesaler to a retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.208" offset="11072240">Non-domestic wine has to be sold through the State Monopoly Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.880" offset="11090944">The only purchaser directly of non-domestic wine in the State of Washington is the State Liquor Control Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.056" offset="11119574">In this instance, it buys California wine in California F.O.B.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.058" offset="11143607">It ships it to its warehouse within the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.029" offset="11159489">It disperses without further costs to its various retail store outlets around the State from which it is purchased by the eventual consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.459" offset="11221243">The argument of California in regard to original jurisdiction is basically threefold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.734" offset="11246320">Number one, they say that the pure governmental interest of the State of California is restrictive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.291" offset="11280488">Number two, they say they have the responsibility by the declarations of their legislature to commence and initiate actions of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.088" offset="11327718">Number three, they say because of the possible damage to their private citizens by the activities of the State of Washington, they have the duty to bring suit in a quasi-sovereign capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.371" offset="11396890">California urges that this case in regard to original jurisdiction is unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.360" offset="11424789">It's unique in its factual pattern as perhaps all cases are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.108" offset="11443806">But it is certainly not unique to this Court in its question of original jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.618" offset="11489886">In answer to California's argument, number one, that they had a pure governmental interest involved in this case, it is our position that the agency of the State of California created through its agricultural code and a marketing order which sort of puts the State, if you please, in the wine business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.499" offset="11601377">We contend that our statutes and our regulations have nothing to do with the official arm of the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.401" offset="11644949">All of our regulations are directed to manufacturers, seller, wholesalers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.666" offset="11673997">They can't do this or that in regard to non-domestic wine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.636" offset="11693955">California by its very constitution prohibits the State of California from being a manufacturer or a seller of wine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.067" offset="11739617">How in the world then, if California contends that this arm of the State of California is the State of California in its sovereign capacity, how in the world then does the State of Washington restrict the activities of the State of California?</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.527" offset="11821432">Of course, we do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.124" offset="11843897">Nor is this quibbling on our part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.218" offset="11856227">We do believe if the State is suing in a purely proprietary or government capacity it must stand and fall as an individual, integral party plaintiff in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.889" offset="11926967">However, California alleges that because of the effect of our regulations on its private businessmen, they are somewhat affected because their whole program is disturbed by our specific regulations or statutes that refer to their private citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.297" offset="12016515">We have cited to Your Honors to many cases in this regard specifically if California has any interest because of that indirect connection at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.854" offset="12070745">We have cited the Georgia versus Tennessee Copper case, where the State of Georgia claimed it had some interest because its rules were being eroded by the action of the noxious gases of the Tennessee Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.975" offset="12155277">This Court calls such interest to make way similarly, in Georgia versus Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.574" offset="12181713">The interest of the State as the owner of a railroad or of many -- the owner of many institutions needing railroad services this Court also called such an alleged direct interest make way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.787" offset="12258513">We have referred Your Honors to the case in this regard of Oklahoma versus Cook which we think somewhat directly parallels this instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.957" offset="12319222">In the case of Oklahoma versus Cook, by the Oklahoma statutes, the State itself brought an action following the insolvency of a bank against the shareholders of the bank for the benefit of creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.060" offset="12379617">California, in its briefs states this, the wine sales promotion activities of the State are those of a commercial or industrial organization promoting nationwide sales of its products.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.692" offset="12430190">In the Oklahoma case, the Court said the protection of depositors of insolvent state banks as a distinct economic policy of the State Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.302" offset="12476583">And our court said this, “We must look beyond the mere legal title of the complaining State to the cause of action asserted into the nature of the State's interest further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.423" offset="12533112">But this principle does not go so far as to permit resort to our original jurisdiction in the name of the State, but in reality, for the benefit of particular individuals.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.217" offset="12580237">Albeit, the State assert economic interest in the claims and declare their enforcement to be a matter of state policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.580" offset="12621720">California's second argument can be quickly disposed of, in our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.017" offset="12647424">The legislative declarations of the legislature of California have urged the proper officials of California and the Attorney General of California to bring actions to a limit -- to eliminate trade barriers with -- with specific reference to the wine industry, now under consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.890" offset="12726941">Of course, this argument has been early answered and often answered by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.778" offset="12750451">An individual state legislature cannot give it state power of its state powers that would cause it to have an original jurisdiction of the United States Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.441" offset="12801128">This Court is the decider of that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.048" offset="12823594">The early case was that of New Hampshire versus Louisiana, a case again similar was the case just cited the case of Oklahoma versus Cook.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.098" offset="12863718">California must have this power or this right of original jurisdiction directly in her own right and not because of anything, her legislature however, impelling that might be to the people of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.637" offset="12925889">The third argument of California is that it has original jurisdiction because of the economic interest of its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.287" offset="12976567">We have done a little mathematics in our brief in regard to the amount or the quantum of this interest affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.724" offset="13022229">And we assume but that by some wizardry, the State of California would gather in the entire Washington State wine market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.264" offset="13080430">And we compared the amount that would be in comparison to the general farming economy of the State of California and the economic impact assuming this unlikely fact of total appropriation of the Washington wine industry or the Washington wine market is 18 thousands of 1%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.991" offset="13175306">That is the impact on the farm economy of the State of California.</text>

            <text syncTime="3480.671" offset="14026062">If I might point this out a little further, Your Honor, and take the two cases that are a little bit different than the standard, quasi-sovereign cases, that's Pennsylvania versus West Virginia and Georgia versus Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.304" offset="14088547">In Pennsylvania versus West Virginia, West Virginia restricted the interstate transportation of its natural gas, to Pennsylvania and Ohio, States that had been using that natural gas in their industry and then their homes for many, many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.600" offset="14169736">And this is what this Court said about the magnitude or the impact of that invasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.529" offset="14217488">The private consumers in each State not only include most of the inhabitants of many urban communities but constitute a substantial portion of the State's population.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.411" offset="14256985">Their health, comfort and welfare are seriously jeopardized by the threatened withdrawal of the gas from the interstate stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.285" offset="14288541">This is a matter of grave public concern in which the State as the representative of the public has an interest apart from that of the individuals affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.106" offset="14327829">And in Georgia versus Pennsylvania Railroad, this is what the Court said in regard to the magnitude of the matter involved.Georgia as a representative of the public is complaining of her role which they have proven limits the opportunities of her people, shackles her industries, retards her development and relegates her to an inferior economic position among her sister States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.042" offset="14443499">These are matters of grave public concern in which Georgia has an interest apart from that of the particular individuals who may be affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.035" offset="14479548">And indeed, in these two somewhat extensions of the basic quasi-sovereign cases, the Court can readily see how strong the impact of the invasion laws on those two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.457" offset="14537226">In the instant case if I submit, this invasion -- this impact, this magnitude does not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.378" offset="14580903">We say that the real parties and interest in this case is not the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.935" offset="14615071">The real party and interest is the private wine industry of California and I submit, perhaps only the larger or the most important, of these particular wine.</text>

            <text syncTime="3677.060" offset="14811617">The original jurisdiction of this Court is sparingly, carefully and gravely given.</text>

            <text syncTime="3698.518" offset="14897403">The number runs in my mind in the State of California in the amount of 47.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.237" offset="14920286">I don't claim that to be wholly accurate but I know that there are dozens of these commissions engaged in the trade promotion, advertising and research activities of the various products they are designed to promote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.456" offset="14989145">These products are principally in interstate commerce particularly with respect to California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.897" offset="15018924">These products in the main, will go outside the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.086" offset="15039718">I can speak for our State which is new in this commodity commission way of doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.021" offset="15063437">We already, although we started much later than in California, have seven of these commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.331" offset="15092694">I could imagine if jurisdiction were granted in this instance that any group of citizens engaged in the business of any kind can find a denying State to act in a so -- somewhat governmental capacity towards them.</text>

            <text syncTime="4146.225" offset="16688253">So as far as we can see, this clause is -- or provision is simply not available to the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="4155.992" offset="16727333">As Your Honors know, the Eleventh Amendment prohibits all suits against the State by or for citizens of other States, New Hampshire versus Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="4170.484" offset="16785324">Therefore, California has been put in a position of bringing this action in a quasi-sovereign capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4179.196" offset="16820120">Now, this is important and material to the question of privileges and immunities because we have to examine the capacity in which California brings this suit to see if it's a person or a citizen within the protection of the Privileges and Immunities Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4200.752" offset="16906428">What is the capacity, that of California?</text>
            <text syncTime="4203.103" offset="16915832">She has likened her capacity to that of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="4206.522" offset="16929416">In Georgia versus Tennessee Copper Company where -- Mr. Justice Holmes described it, in that capacity the State has an interest independent of and behind the title of its citizens in all the air, earth and within its domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="4222.537" offset="16993468">And again and again, the Court has defined this quasi-sovereign interest as being an interest apart from that of the individual's concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="4231.552" offset="17029622">So clearly, California, as a sovereign State, is bringing this as a State, not as a group of citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="4243.974" offset="17079254">Now, accordingly, the Privileges and Immunities Clause is not applicable to this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4252.954" offset="17115199">It is a protection afforded only natural persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="4258.061" offset="17135574">I think an interesting case in this regard is Bank of Augusta versus Earle.</text>
            <text syncTime="4263.335" offset="17156681">There, the Bank of Georgia Corporation was seeking to sustain its right to exercise corporate powers in another State, namely Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="4272.369" offset="17192835">And that right to exercise these corporate powers outside its own State was challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="4278.296" offset="17216554">It invoked the Privileges and Immunities Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4283.005" offset="17235362">And it was there held -- well first, the argument on behalf of the bank was that if all it's members of the corporation were rather than of Georgia and they were within the protection of the Privileges and Immunities Clause then the corporation should be, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="4299.757" offset="17302444">That was rejected and it was held there that the corporation, not being a natural person was not within the protection of the clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4308.838" offset="17338702">And excellent discussion of the nature of the clause is contained against Paul versus Virginia, decided in 1868 where the Court said, “The term citizens as used applies only to natural persons, members of the body politic owing allegiance to the State, not to artificial persons created by the legislature possessing only the attribute -- attributes which the legislature has prescribed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4335.023" offset="17443506">In Blake against McClung, a case involving an insolvency statute where residents of the State were preferred over non-residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4346.979" offset="17491257">The Court held that it -- there was a violation of the Privileges and Immunities Clause with respect to natural persons residing out of Tennessee but the foreign corporation could not avail itself of that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4362.896" offset="17554996">Accordingly, it would seem that through this clear line of authority, California, not being a natural person, may not invoke the Privileges and Immunities Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4375.233" offset="17604315">And on authority of Hill versus District of Columbia which we have cited in our brief, we would suggest that she cannot invoke it, invoke this provision since she is not within the class of persons with respect to whom the alleged acts of Washington are unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="4400.278" offset="17704521">Now, I will discuss the Twenty-first Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4404.571" offset="17721657">I wish only to add before leaving the Privileges and Immunities Clause that what I shall say of the Twenty-first Amendment with respect to the Commerce Clause, applies equally to the Privileges and Immunities Clause namely the Twenty-first Amendment has taken the restrictive and regulatory acts of a State with respect to imported liquor outside these provisions of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4439.081" offset="17859688">Now, with respect to the Commerce Clause, it is said that not only is our legislation and regulations a burden but it is discriminatory with respect to California wine which squarely presents the question of the effect of the Twenty-first Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4460.225" offset="17944221">In it's brief, and as I understand it today, California has contended that the true meaning of the Twenty-first Amendment is still in doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="4470.589" offset="17985703">Suggested that what courts -- what this Court has said in the past with respect to the Twenty-first Amendment is mostly dicta.</text>
            <text syncTime="4480.053" offset="18023633">It implied that this Court has never adequately considered the Twenty-first Amendment or it's economic significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4489.915" offset="18063026">Well, this is certainly not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4492.763" offset="18074415">The Amendment has been carefully and fully considered by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4500.191" offset="18104090">The arguments of California in this case, as many of Your Honors know, are mere repetitions of ones that have been made many times before.</text>
            <text syncTime="4513.364" offset="18156857">In the course of its brief, California has contended, as I understand its contentions, that the Twenty-first Amendment should apply only to imports into dry States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4527.938" offset="18215163">That the Amendment prohibits imports of liquor into a State only when, in violation of proper or reasonable state laws, rather than state laws, as the Amendment reads.</text>
            <text syncTime="4542.087" offset="18271692">That finally, that somehow the Webb-Kenyon Act was overlooked by this Court when it first construed the Twenty-first Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4551.493" offset="18309308">Now, I find the complete answer to all of these contentions in the State Border of Equalization of California versus Young's Market Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="4563.816" offset="18358627">Therein, Justice Brandeis did a remarkable thing in that he set up each of these contentions in concise language and answered each in concise, clear, understandable language.</text>
            <text syncTime="4580.966" offset="18427277">I can't improve on his language and if the Court will indulge me, I should like to refer to some of it because it is so completely applicable to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4591.021" offset="18467506">There, the Court held -- what the plaintiff's complaint of is the refusal to let them import beer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4598.060" offset="18495613">Now, of course, this case involved a license fee for the privilege of importing beer into the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="4606.821" offset="18530617">It squarely presented the meaning of the Twenty-first Amendment to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4611.997" offset="18551411">The Court held, what the plaintiff's complaint of is the refusal to let them import beer without paying for the privilege of importation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4620.733" offset="18586311">Prior to the Twenty-first Amendment, it would obviously been unconstitutional to impose a fee for that privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="4628.321" offset="18616613">The position would have been -- would have been void, not because it resulted in discrimination but -- but because that he was a direct burden on commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4638.595" offset="18657782">The Amendment which prohibited the transportation or importation of intoxicating liquors into any State in violation of the laws ,thereof, abrogated the right to import free, so far as concerns intoxicating liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4654.380" offset="18720893">Now, Justice Brandeis gave the basic construction to the Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4661.504" offset="18749419">He said, “The words used are apt to confer upon the State the power to forbid all importations which do not comply with the conditions which it prescribes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4674.414" offset="18801037">I think the word, “conditions” are important.</text>
            <text syncTime="4678.287" offset="18816502">Then, he analyzed the contentions of the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="4682.025" offset="18831444">He said the plaintiffs asked us to limit this broad command.</text>
            <text syncTime="4686.183" offset="18848057">They request us to construe the Amendment, they're saying in effect, the State may prohibit the importation of liquors, providing it prohibits the manufacture and stay within its borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="4697.293" offset="18892570">That's one of the contentions that I understand, of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="4700.447" offset="18905109">It only applies to the dry States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4704.017" offset="18919424">But if it permits such manufacture and sale, then it must compete on equal terms with the domestic intoxicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4712.378" offset="18952861">To say this would involve not a construction of the Amendment but a rewriting of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4718.887" offset="18978879">Then he answers the question that the -- the contention that the state regulation must be reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4728.719" offset="19018271">Plaintiff argued that, despite the Amendment, the State may not regulate importations except for the purpose of protecting the public health, safety or morals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4736.957" offset="19051186">The importer's license fee was not imposed to that end.</text>
            <text syncTime="4740.652" offset="19066023">Same contention that California has made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4743.238" offset="19076368">Surely, the State may adopt the lesser degree of regulations said Justice Brandeis, than total prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4749.507" offset="19101445">Can it be doubted that a State might establish a state monopoly of the manufacture and sale of beer and either prohibit all competing importations or discourage importation by levying a heavy impost or channelize desired importations by confining them to a single consignee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4769.374" offset="19180857">And in that last language, of course, he identified the practices of the State of Washington in confining our imports to the single consignee, of namely, the State Liquor Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="4784.798" offset="19242611">Then with respect to the charge that the Court had overlooked the Webb-Kenyon Act, Justice Brandeis said, “As we think the language of the Amendment is clear, we do not discuss these matters.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4799.180" offset="19300080">Referring to the prior interpretations given the Webb-Kenyon Act which being an Act of Congress, was not subject to the same rules of construction as the constitutional amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4813.692" offset="19358177">He said, the claim that the statutory provisions and the regulations are void under the Equal Protection Clause may be briefly disposed of, classification recognized by the Twenty-first Amendment cannot be deemed forbidden by the Fourteenth.</text>
            <text syncTime="4828.031" offset="19415542">Well, since this case, Young's Market case, involved and required the construction of the meaning of the Twenty-first Amendment, it did not constitute dicta, merely because the principles announced in construing this Amendment governed other fact patterns certainly does not mean that it was dicta.</text>
            <text syncTime="4854.414" offset="19521076">These determinations were given in response to contentions made in the case and were necessary to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4861.984" offset="19551274">And the principles laid down there by Justice Brandeis are the law and not dicta.</text>
            <text syncTime="4871.354" offset="19588786">Now, California in the face of Young's Market case says our case is different in that it involved discrimination whereas Young's Market case did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4882.304" offset="19632567">But California has, in this respect, overlooked Indianapolis Brewing Company versus the Liquor Control Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4891.402" offset="19668929">That case involved a Michigan Act which prohibited local dealers from selling beer manufactured in another State that discriminated against Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="4902.433" offset="19713128">This was clearly a discrimination type law and the very worst type with respect to the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4913.334" offset="19756701">It was a clear burden and a discrimination on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4918.345" offset="19776763">It was contended that it did violate the Commerce Clause, the Due Process Clause, and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4926.426" offset="19809050">The Court held for whatever its character, the law is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="4929.638" offset="19821902">Since the Twenty-first Amendment was held in the Young's Market Company case, the right of a State to prohibit or regulate the importation of intoxicating liquor is not limited by the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4941.635" offset="19869863">Another clear case of discrimination was that involved in Joseph S. Finch and Co. versus McKittrick, also decided in 1939 by District Justice Brandeis, involving the Michigan's and Missouri's statute, which is similar to the other -- at which I described prohibited imports from States that discriminated against Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="4967.470" offset="19973204">Again, it was attacked on the basis of violating the Commerce Clause and the several clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4974.814" offset="20002670">The Court said, “The claim for the unconstitutionality has rested in this Court, substantially on the contention that the statute violates the Commerce Clause.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4983.839" offset="20038719">It's urged that the Missouri law does not relate to the protection of health, safety, and morality or the promotion of their social welfare, but it is merely an economic weapon of retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4996.373" offset="20088874">And hence, the Twenty-first Amendment should not be interpreted as granting power to enact it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5002.016" offset="20111444">Since that Amendment, the right of a State to prohibit or regulate the importation of intoxicating liquor is not limited by the Commerce Clause, and it was citing Young's Market case.</text>

            <text syncTime="5022.854" offset="20194826">It involved the impact of the Twenty-first Amendment upon the Commerce Clause on certain parts of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas R. Garlington</label>
            <text syncTime="5037.320" offset="20252609">That is correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5038.861" offset="20258774">I think this is a noble contention raised for the first time in this case by the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="5045.690" offset="20286151">Of course, as Your Honor will readily apprehend, the language and the scope of the language as it has referred to the Commerce Clause and to the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, can -- is indistinguishable from its operations upon the Privileges and Immunities Clause, and that is our second contention with respect to that clause which you cannot distinguish the protection of that Privileges and Immunities Clause over the Protection of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment for these purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5092.300" offset="20472560">And the case in point, which particularly discussed the matter of the Equal Protection Clause is Mahoney versus Joseph Triner Corporation decided in 1938, again, by Justice Brandeis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5106.991" offset="20531388">In that case, the State of Minnesota passed a clearly discriminatory law which prevented the -- the sale of liquor in Minnesota if it contained more than 25% alcohol, unless it would register with the Patent Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="5128.285" offset="20616547">The particular economic purpose of the status at the time, but it obviously had no relationship to any police power purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="5136.517" offset="20649462">It was challenged under the Fourteenth Amendment and with particular emphasis on the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5144.116" offset="20679868">The Court held the statute clearly discriminates in favor of liquor process within the State as against liquor process (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="5153.308" offset="20716648">But only the locally processed may be sold regardless of whether the brand has been registered, that under the Amendment, discrimination against imported liquor is permissible, although it is not an incident of reasonable regulation of the liquor traffic, was settled by State Board of Equalization versus Young's Market case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5173.184" offset="20796061">Now, California has made another contention in its reply brief which I feel must answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="5186.712" offset="20850186">And that is that, and again, in the argument today, that the Twenty-first Amendment applies only to incidents of regulations at the border apparently, at the importation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5202.309" offset="20912567">So -- as soon as that liquor is within the State, the Twenty-first Amendment is no longer applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5212.133" offset="20951855">Well, first of all, let us understand the operation of the Washington statutes as set out.</text>
            <text syncTime="5219.610" offset="20981844">It does prohibit the importation of wine into the State of Washington, except that purchased by the Liquor Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="5228.705" offset="21018206">The wine purchased by the State Liquor Control Board is purchased pursuant to statutes, which governs its sale and distribution and so forth inside the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="5240.837" offset="21066689">And that is the condition upon which any California wine comes into the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="5247.572" offset="21093648">And it is a condition which is rightfully imposed by the State of Washington under the Twenty-first Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5256.286" offset="21128547">Now, this Court, I am sure, has never understood the operation of the Twenty-first Amendment to apply only to the act of importation, but ceasing to have effect after the liquor became -- came inside the territory of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="5276.665" offset="21210049">The understanding of Mr. Justice Black is set out in United States versus Frankfort Distilleries, decided in 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="5288.466" offset="21257279">This case, you may recall, involved the application of the Sherman Act against price conspiracy by liquor companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5298.677" offset="21298030">It was contended by the defendants that since the Sherman Act derived its power from the Commerce Clause, the Commerce Clause no longer operated with respect to liquor that they had a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5313.172" offset="21356022">And, of course, the Court decided that that was true only if the States had indicated they approved of the price regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5322.348" offset="21392802">But for our purposes here, as to whether or not the Twenty-first Amendment applies to the control of liquor within a State, Mr. Justice Black said, it is argued, the Twenty-first Amendment to the Constitution bars its prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5337.316" offset="21452675">That Amendment bestowed upon the States broad regulatory power over the liquor traffic within their territories.</text>
            <text syncTime="5344.340" offset="21480782">It has not given the States plenary and exclusive power to regulate the conduct of persons doing an interstate liquor business outside their boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="5352.782" offset="21514533">Granting the States -- this is the important language, granting the State's full authority to determine the conditions upon which liquor can come into its territory and what will be done with it after it gets there, it does not follow from this the fact that the United States is without power to regulate the conduct of those engaged in interstate trade outside the jurisdiction of the State of Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="5378.810" offset="21618604">And, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, in his concurring opinion, indicated his understanding in this respect, if a State, for its own sufficient reasons, deems that the desirable policy to standardize the price of liquor within its borders, either by direct price fixing statute or by permissive sanction, the Twenty-first Amendment gives it the power and the Commerce Clause as not being said.</text>
            <text syncTime="5404.182" offset="21720064">The understanding being that this applied equally to regulation within the State after the liquor had arrived as well as the act of importation.</text>

            <text syncTime="5698.641" offset="22897977">And it stemmed from a history of very great difficulty in trying to adjust the extensive and admitted police powers of a State in regulating liquor with the Commerce Clause and the Equal Protection Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="5736.927" offset="23051055">Such canons of adjudication open wide the door of conflict and confusion, which have in the past characterized the liquor controversies in this Court and in no small measure form part of the unedifying history which led first to the Eighteenth and then to the Twenty-first Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5754.174" offset="23120018">Less than six years ago, this Court rejected the impossible task of deciding instead of leaving it for legislatures to decide what constitutes a reasonable regulation of the liquor traffic.</text>
