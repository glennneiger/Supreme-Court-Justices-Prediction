            <text syncTime="2.487" offset="113351">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4.949" offset="123173">At the recess I was discussing the legal implications of the appeal on the Alaska property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.949" offset="155146">At Chapter 22, the Session Laws of 1953 commonly known as the repealing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.999" offset="199346">It is our view of course that under the general universal rules of statutory construction that the repealing Act having saved some taxes from the effect of repeal is to be construed as an intention on the part of the Legislature to save those taxes and none other upon the general ground that a specific exemption, exception or provision is controlling over a general provision expressed in other laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.296" offset="368515">Of course under the common law as it existed even back to foundation of our own Constitution, the repeal of a taxing statute abrogated all taxes due and unpaid at that time of the repeal unless they were specifically saved or unless -- in other words, the repealing Act contained a specific provision to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.842" offset="510725">This is the universal rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.927" offset="519084">There's no authority to a contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.230" offset="528280">None is cited by the territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.898" offset="538937">I do not think that they challenge the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.155" offset="551999">They simply seek to avoid its application.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.698" offset="566209">Now, many states -- United States, Territory of Alaska, all have general laws dealing with this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.937" offset="607169">Alaska had a General Savings Act which is quoted in the briefs of counsel which saves -- provides at a no obligation founded on the statute or obligation incurred, tax or license to be due.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.429" offset="709047">It provides -- cuts the fees and licenses due may be enforced after repeal unless the repealing Act provides to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.451" offset="765158">And of course it's our position and supported I think amply that this repealing Act did provide to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.619" offset="813850">It was not the intention of the Legislature to save all taxes due under the Act nor was it their intention to abrogate all the taxes due under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.347" offset="868812">They enacted a special section, Section 2 of the Act, specifically delineating the taxes they desired to save.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.234" offset="928266">That provision is contrary or in conflict with the General Savings Act of Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.088" offset="967764">And being specific, later in point at time, it must be held to control.</text>

            <text syncTime="371.592" offset="1589791">Now of course the exemption had been in effect in prior years, they left it in effect just to priors years and continued it in effect as to the current year.</text>
