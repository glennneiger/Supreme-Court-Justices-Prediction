            <label>Mr. Robert A. Bicks</label>
            <text syncTime="51.059" offset="307597">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.686" offset="322121">The United States appeals for an order -- from an order entered by the District Court over the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.796" offset="350542">That order first denied the United States' motion directed against the Arapahoe Pipeline Company to carry out an Elkins Act judgment provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.590" offset="397772">And at the same time, the Circuit granted the motion made by two other pipeline companies to construe that same provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.995" offset="443329">Both motions post essentially the same issue and as a perhaps, helpful preliminary focus for the statement of the case to come.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.175" offset="484080">That issue maybe simply put at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.678" offset="498082">The issue involved interpretation of an Elkins Act judgment provision limiting to 7%, dividends payable by the bulk of this country's oil pipeline to the shipper-owners, that is to the major oil company that owned oil pipelines and shipped oil over.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.831" offset="582719">On the one hand, the United States urges that the judgment permits each shipper-owner only a fair return on his investment outlay of his share in the pipeline's total capitalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.309" offset="640606">On the other hand, defendant's urge and the court below agreed, the judgment permits each shipper-owner not only a return on his investment outlay, but an equal return on investment outlays made by others.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.486" offset="701315">That is on loans to the pipeline not by the shipper-owner but by third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.568" offset="729631">The defendant's construction applied to the facts of Arapahoe would permit each of Arapahoe's two shipper-owners a more than 70% return on their less than three-year old investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.701" offset="782190">This construction issue takes on the meaning in light of a brief, very brief march of those events that preceded entry of the Elkins Act judgment at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.614" offset="829837">The Elkins Act recall made oil pipelines common carriers and sought to ensure equal access for all oil shippers to oil pipelines at equal cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.708" offset="878216">To this end, the Elkins Act barred the granting or receipt by or through any means or device, whatsoever, of rebates, offsets or concessions from published tariff rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.705" offset="934222">The chief purpose of the Elkins Act that this Court put it in the Union Pacific case at pages 461 and 462 was to eliminate rebates, concessions and discrimination from the handling of commerce to the end that all persons and places might carry on their activities on an equal basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.618" offset="1009873">In fact, favoritism which destroys equality between shippers, however brought about it, is at an end.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.783" offset="1042474">It was with this purpose uppermost, that the United States proceeded under the Elkins Act on December 21, 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.884" offset="1078941">That complaint named as defendant from 52 oil common carrier pipelines and their shipper-owner parents that is the major oil companies that own the pipelines and the 27 shipper-owner parents, that is the major oil companies that own the pipelines and shipped oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.442" offset="1157099">The complaint alleged that although the oil company parents were normally paying published tariff rates, they were in fact receiving rebates, offsets or concessions in the guise of dividends and earnings from their pipelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.171" offset="1228048">On the same day, that complaint was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.383" offset="1240900">The judgment here at issue was added.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.285" offset="1252498">That judgment in its crucial portion which, may I suggest, is found on page 10, the middle of page 10 of volume 1 of the record before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.919" offset="1311013">That judgment, in its crucial portion, limits payments by a pipeline in any year to its shipper-owner to its share of 7% evaluation.</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_a_bicks" startTime="329.562" stopTime="898.690">
            <label>Mr. Robert A. Bicks</label>
            <text syncTime="329.562" offset="1421667">And the provision goes on to specify that dividends paid in accord with that limitation formula shall be deemed permitted insofar as the Interstate Commerce and Elkins Act is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.163" offset="1488018">Evaluation, of course, is defined by -- by precisely as the latest final evaluation made by the Interstate Commerce Commission of property owned and used for common carrier purposes by the oil pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.510" offset="1545383">The word, "seven percent" need no definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.381" offset="1556877">But undefined, however, are the words, "its share."</text>
            <text syncTime="367.123" offset="1571819">And it's on the interpretation of the words, "its share" that the controversy before this Court focuses.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.130" offset="1599927">The United States' position is that the dividend limitation formula, the words, "its share of 7% evaluation," were meant to permit each shipper-owner only a fair return on his capital outlay, his share of the pipeline's total capitalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.052" offset="1679548">To this end, the United States would define the words, "its share," to relate not only to other stockholdings, but to the pipeline's total capitalization for a fair measure of capital outlay for the purpose of gauging a fair return on capital outlay, must relate not only to other stockholding, but to the entire bundle of investors rights, whether labelled, equity or debt, which make up the pipeline's capitalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.806" offset="1802637">Defendants, on the other hand, urge and the court below agree that the dividend limitation formula, the words, "its share of 7% evaluation," permit each shipper-owner a return not only on his capital outlay, but an equal return on capital outlays made by others that is on loans, to our pipelines, not by the shipper-owner, but by third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.834" offset="1910680">To this end, defendants would define the words, "its share," to relate only to other stockholdings in the pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.474" offset="1945266">As a result, as soon as the pipeline increases its capitalization by borrowing from a third party permissible dividends to the shipper-owners jump immediately and precise proportions of the money borrowed by the pipeline from third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.240" offset="2012348">This, despite the fact that the increase in capitalization stands from no new capital outlay, no new out-of-pocket capital contribution by the shipper-owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.697" offset="2058115">I think one brief factual or hypothetically should draw clear the difference between the two constructions before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.909" offset="2095000">Assume, two oil companies set up a pipeline, assume further that each of the oil companies owns half the stock of the pipeline and assume finally that the pipeline incurs no debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.449" offset="2149125">In these circumstances, both parties agreed that each shipper-owner's permissible dividend would be equal to one-half that is the share of its stockholdings -- of the total stockholdings in the pipeline of 7% evaluation.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.871" offset="2210879">However, as soon as the pipeline incurs debt, the difference in the two constructions becomes significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.625" offset="2237837">Assumed to carry on with our hypothetical that the pipeline owned equally by two oil companies incurs that as did Arapahoe equal roughly to eight times the value of the stock bought by the shipper-owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.250" offset="2308368">In all circumstances, according to defendant's construction, permissible dividends to each shipper-owner would jump immediately eight times as the pipeline borrows capital equal to eight times -- borrows from third party's capital equal to eight times the stock owned by the shipper-owner, so dividends to the shipper-owners increase immediately eight times.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.181" offset="2400110">This, despite the fact that the increase in the pipeline's capitalization, represents no new capital outlay, no new capital contribution by the shipper-owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.499" offset="2441383">As a result, divorced -- divorced from the measure of each shipper-owner's return is his capital outlay -- his capital outlay, his share in the capitalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.987" offset="2491329">There is little but no relation to the measure of his return from the pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.856" offset="2510764">This result, we urge, is at odds with the judgment's basic rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.142" offset="2531976">This judgment, after all, not only specifies a dividend limitation formula, but in addition, makes clear that dividends paid in the court with that formula -- and I'm quoting from the last line of paragraph three on page 10 of volume 1, "Shall be permitted insofar as the Interstate Commerce and Elkins Act are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.434" offset="2629151">The judgment's essential purpose then drawn from the Elkins Act, which gave it life, was to equalize net transport cost, equalize the net transport cost between on the one hand shipper-owners and on the other hand, independent oil shippers, shippers with no ownership interest in pipelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.578" offset="2717654">To this end, the judgment sought to limit each shipper-owner to a fair return on his capital outlay, a return, if you will, that reflected simply the cost to the pipeline of the shipper-owner's capital contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.729" offset="2778258">The shipper-owner's capital cost to the extent that the judgment is construed to limit each shipper-owner only a fair return, on his capital outlay, his net transport cost become the same, become the same as the independent oil shipper with no ownership interest in the pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.087" offset="2863731">And as a result, no discrimination, no concessional rebate, no unfairness result.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.038" offset="2891525">However, to the extent that each shipper-owner's dividends are related not only to his capital contribution, but are measured by capital contribution that's made by others, that excess in return is deemed by the judgment to be a kin for discrimination, an offset or a rebate, at odds with this judgment in the Elkins Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.705" offset="2982222">Stated other ways, this judgment had two really basically simple purposes, two basic purposes that are twinned, but related.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.361" offset="3024854">Those purposes were first, on the one hand, to limit each shipper-owner to a fair return on his capital outlay in order that the second, on the other hand, independent shippers, shippers with no ownership interest to the pipeline, might be protected against -- if you will, that favoritism which destroys equality between oil shippers which the Elkins Act and presumably this judgment, were meant to eliminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.921" offset="3135091">Let's compare.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.625" offset="3141883">Let's see what defendant's construction does to those twin purposes, first, to limit each shipper-owner's return to a fair return on his capital outlay, Table 1 and Appendix A of the United States reply brief, sets forth dividends actually paid -- actually paid to each of the shipper-owners of the 15 pipelines that are active parties and interests before this Court, now.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.100" offset="3275734">That table reveals that in the year 1956, the last year before the actions -- now, before this Court were filed, each of the shipper-owners received an average of 18.7% return on their investment, plus surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.575" offset="3349713">An 18.7% return on their investment plus surplus in the pipelines, a return more than two and a half times.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.786" offset="3390568">That was the judgment envisioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.463" offset="3401226">And second, what impact did that return have?</text>
            <text syncTime="828.614" offset="3417840">What impact did that return have on the second goal of this judgment, the second goal to promote some sort of equal competitive status for independent oil shippers, oil shippers with no ownership interest in the pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.335" offset="3476668">Compare if you will, dividends actually paid for the year 1956, the 18.7% with the total transport revenue of the pipelines for that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.414" offset="3521076">That comparison is quite striking.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.911" offset="3531003">It shows that in the year, 1956, 22 cents, 22 cents out of every dollar that each shipper-owner nominally paid in rates, he got back via dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.377" offset="3588890">Non owner-shippers, independent oil shippers, got no 20 -- such 22 cents back.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.142" offset="3611982">But the most important, 22 cents out of every dollar they did pay, ended up in the pocket of the shipper-owner against who may might well be competing at the other end of the pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.702" offset="3658167">Look at this graphically, in terms of two oil producers in the same field trying to get their oil in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.599" offset="3689723">One owns the pipeline, the other doesn't.</text>
