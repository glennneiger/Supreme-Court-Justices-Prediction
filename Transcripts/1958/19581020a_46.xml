            <text syncTime="17.556" offset="173641">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.044" offset="183568">Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.689" offset="198092">I have reached the point in my argument where I was about to turn my attention to the -- the meaning and definition of the word “personal” as it appears in Section 24 of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.443" offset="269145">The word -- the -- the word “personal”, as used in Section 24, has two distinct factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.973" offset="315225">The statute says that no deduction shall be allowed for personal expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.108" offset="347826">Now, the denial of the deduction is a legal conclusion and such denial should follow a determination at a particular expense of this person.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.405" offset="408952">To restate, this means that, and to my mind and nothing but a factual determination of personal, should precede the legal conclusion of nondeductibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.896" offset="470915">This seems patent from the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.636" offset="489932">Now, in the Commissioner's argument and in the Court of Appeals below, this is the method by which the conclusion of personal results.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.271" offset="556492">Referring again to my previous reference that the Commissioner said this expense should be denied for the reason that petitioners are not away from home.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.157" offset="620022">Now, the -- the deduction was originally denied for the reason that the expenses were classified as personal.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.150" offset="667982">The -- the word “home” appears in Section 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.475" offset="685223">The word “personal” appears in Section 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.122" offset="699852">Now, they are finding their criteria of the -- of the meaning of the word “personal” in Section 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.513" offset="745409">And the -- the logic of the Commissioner's theory then becomes this.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.168" offset="768084">Under Section 23, the deduction is denied automatically once the doctrine is applied the way you work at your home because you cannot be away from such a home at work.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.217" offset="820224">This is a logical impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.077" offset="831718">Then they say the expense is personal.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.906" offset="843003">In other words, they say it's personal because it's nondeductible as they have defined the word “home”.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.169" offset="884067">The whole structure of 24 is thereby reversed instead of determining that the thing is nondeductible because it's personal, they first determined that it is nondeductible under Section 23 and then label it personal and this --</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="211.868" offset="950836">Well, the concepts blend together in some extent, don't they?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_r_dixon" startTime="215.911" stopTime="637.347">
            <label>Mr. Daniel R. Dixon</label>
            <text syncTime="215.911" offset="967032">Your Honor, I -- I say yes, provided the facts are kept clear, but this is done purely as a rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.321" offset="1012694">Requirement one under the Flowers decision says the expense must be ordinary and necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.527" offset="1037458">Now, under the Commissioner's theory that we have only failed to meet requirement two that factually concedes that our expenses are ordinary and necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.460" offset="1081240">Yet, at the same time they are holding that these expenses are personal.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.125" offset="1099839">Now, I say that factually, these are in conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.451" offset="1113213">I turn to requirement three of the Flowers case.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.536" offset="1129514">Requirement three says that the expense must be incurred into pursue of the trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.929" offset="1155114">Now, again, under the Commissioner's theory, that factually concedes that my petitioners had met this requirement in a factual sense, and I also state that is factually in conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.522" offset="1205478">And further, Your Honor, I do not think that the word “blend” correctly presents this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.716" offset="1238288">I think this.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.470" offset="1245288">I think that since Section 24 is the section that was enacted to deny certain expenses that a factual determination should be made under Section 24 logically prior to a determination under Section 23 for if a factual determination is made, that expense is personal.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.875" offset="1338911">Section 24 strikes it down immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.836" offset="1350719">There is no necessity to refer to Section 23 in any way because Section 24 says, “No deduction shall be allowed for a personal expenditure.”</text>
            <text syncTime="323.758" offset="1398366">Now, in the proceedings below, in the Tax Court, the criteria by which this matter was resolved and which has been used in other cases stated in brief on rare occasions, but has never been fully implemented was that an inquiry should be made to determine whether or not under the all of the factual circumstances is reasonable to expect demand to move his home to his place of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.135" offset="1515917">Now, if under that criteria, which was -- which was developed in the Tax Court's decisions and which was reviewed by the entire court, Your Honor, they determined that it was unreasonable to expect our petitioners to move their homes to construction sites under these factual circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.190" offset="1608182">With that factual determination before the Court, then the question of the personal nature of these expenses were disposed of and the same thing is true of all of these travel expenses, the commuting situation which has complicated this issue ever since the Barnhill case.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.653" offset="1689997">Unfortunately, the Barnhill case realized that commuting in a sense, forces travel to get to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.929" offset="1727091">And they said, “We cannot reach the conclusion that a man's home is where he lives because of the commuting analogy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="415.076" offset="1763662">But there are two rebuttals to that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.319" offset="1772648">The first is that commuting expense and travel expense must be separate and distinct types of expenses because the statute specifically permits the deduction of travel expense, but it does not permit the deduction of commuting expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.607" offset="1837850">The only thing necessary to clarify that particular phase of the problem is for the Court to make a preliminary determination if this is, is or not commuting expense and no one is arguing that commuting expenses should be deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.240" offset="1896364">They have never been treated as an ordinary and necessary business expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.920" offset="1915068">They have been labeled personal and it's to pointed out in brief, I think, that this was an unfortunate and a fact to which contributes to the confusion here because by classifying commuting expense of this person and then analogizing commuting to travel expense, you get this word “personal” brought back in to the picture improperly.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.450" offset="2009213">It then obscures the element of choice, which, I think, is the fundamental issue in all of these cases whether or not these expenses result from the personal choice of a taxpayer or required by the needs of his business.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.758" offset="2074415">Our people have homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.821" offset="2090611">They're -- they tried to -- to stabilize their families, they have their children in school, all of these factors, and there are away from home in every sense of the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.135" offset="2143901">And on that point, one further thing, Section 24 requires an ascertainment of the difference between a personal expense and a business expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.403" offset="2208998">It does not require an ascertainment of the difference between a -- a deductible travel expense and a nondeductible one.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.054" offset="2243584">This is a matter which order in the Section -- the purview of Section 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.325" offset="2264691">Section 23 says expenses that are ordinary and necessary are deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.645" offset="2285902">It does not permit all business expenses as deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.812" offset="2302621">So the theory of 24 is to distinguish between business and personal expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.912" offset="2335013">The function of 23 is to decide whether or not a particular travel expense is or is not deductible by meeting the three requirements which this Court has established.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.285" offset="2388511">Now, under this rationale of stating that an expense is personal because it is already been decided to be nondeductible, Section 24 is then emasculated and becomes nonfunctional because the result has already been previously determined under 23 so by this one theory, one principle of saying home is where you work, 23 is in the sense rendered nonfunctional and 24, both, are rendered non-functional.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.762" offset="2538454">At that point, then the so-called exception comes into the picture and the entire legal controversy revolves around what is temporary and what is indefinite and it is our position, Your Honor, that at this stage of the game, they -- that theory is completely out from -- on the both statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.045" offset="2623509">It's running free.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.322" offset="2628629">It's fabricating its loss as it sees fit.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel R. Dixon</label>
            <text syncTime="1015.620" offset="4165883">I -- I have discussed this point in brief, Your Honor, but I do not believe I discussed it in reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.188" offset="4188139">I discussed it in abstract rather than in reference to this particular citation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.377" offset="4236831">Now, Your Honor will permit, there are some other cases of -- of, I would say rather extreme judicial and administrative legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.446" offset="4289181">I like to refer to the fact in the Whitaker case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.682" offset="4302137">James R. Whitaker was an engineer who has a home in Iowa and he -- in his employment with a New York construction firm that we had a contract with the army that his employment carried him to Thule, Greenland and his employment was an offshore construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.568" offset="4385625">Now, Whitaker worked in Greenland a total of 222 days for the taxable year in controversy today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.544" offset="4417599">He returned to the States twice during that 222 day period and the court said there, “Your work is indefinite and you are not entitled to travel expense deduction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.053" offset="4471620">This -- this need marks the outer boundaries of extremity in denying his deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.889" offset="4502967">I would also like to refer to the fact in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.096" offset="4515715">In the instant case, petitioner's assignment was conceded to have deductible expenses in regard to his employment in Charleston and in regards to his employment at Fort Bragg.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.035" offset="4567542">And one of his employments lasted three weeks, as I recall, and the other, seven and a half.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.031" offset="4587499">But petitioner's assignment was following the same pattern of working and living throughout the entire year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.776" offset="4618428">His relationship to his employer was the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.912" offset="4631071">The manner by which he obtained his work was the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.250" offset="4648417">Substantially, there was no difference in his employment in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.295" offset="4672554">The Commissioner has not argued that these are -- do not give rise to deductible expenses yet he argued at the same time that his employment at -- at Kinston does not give rise to this deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.920" offset="4743084">One further thing before I leave what I can say -- what I am specifying here as illustration of -- of legislation outside this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.897" offset="4783000">In this very case, there is considerable reference to the fact that my petitioners quit the employment on some of these occasions and the -- the apparent logic in this is that petitioners could have work longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.171" offset="4856038">If they had worked longer, then their work would have become indefinite and indefinite employment does not give rise to travel expenses therefore, they are denied this deduction because they quit the employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.945" offset="4907133">Now, this adds a complete new requirement for deductibility that so far as I know is new in this case and I think that, while I'm not going to dwell on the constitutional aspect, if -- if the tax laws of the country are going to be interpreted in such a manner that the fact that a man quits his job, results in a denial of -- of the deduction that he would otherwise be entitled to, I say there is a grave question there of infringing his right or infringing the Thirteenth Amendment regarding his involuntary servitude and it is pointed in brief but are not directly in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.131" offset="5063868">In the opinion of these cases, the language of the Court there says that a man had a right, an unqualified right to terminate his employment and I think that this throws the strong shadow over that right because he puts a -- a taxpayer in a position of having to stop and consider very seriously if he can terminate his employment without loosing his tax deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.495" offset="5225305">Now, the cases have -- are -- are falling into the constant theme of the cases in the Tax Couth and the Circuit now is temporary versus indefinite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.165" offset="5275982">And this thing is called an exemption and I would like to read respondent's language as to this exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.858" offset="5306807">He said this exception is ameliorated in nature and is apparently based on the theory that it is inequitable to call the post the duty to tax home if the taxpayer being there only temporarily is forced by economic circumstances to maintain elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.047" offset="5383607">What -- my objection to this is that if you accept as valid, the principle that a man's home is where he works, then the little application denies all taxpayers to travel expense then the only thing that becomes valid is what is here called an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.966" offset="5483186">And I think it's difficult to find a more -- clearer repudiation of the original principle than -- than this so-called exception which he says is ameliorated in nature and is apparently based on the theory that he says is -- is equitable in nature.</text>

            <text syncTime="1762.804" offset="7154604">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.968" offset="7171218">At the outset, I like to restate, if I may, just what the party is complaining about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.927" offset="7211029">Contrary to the impression which may have been conveyed, the question before the Court is not whether or not construction workers should be allowed a deduction for travel expenses in connection with out-of-town construction job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.204" offset="7284172">On that broad question, both parties are in full agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.594" offset="7305697">The whole controversy here relates solely to the extent to which this deduction shall be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.281" offset="7344462">Now, as Mr. Dixon pointed out on Thursday, most of these out-of-town construction jobs are of a short-term nature, requiring an employment only of a few weeks or of a few months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.157" offset="7407992">As to employment of that nature, it is the policy of the Commissioner, and has been for some time, it is the policy of the Commissioner who has made every effort to be reasonable in this area to allow the deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.876" offset="7474866">But these taxpayers are not satisfied with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.697" offset="7490121">They claim that they are entitled to this deduction for travel expenses including the regular cost of meals and lodging on an everyday, day in day out basis regardless of the duration of the construction project or their employment on that project.</text>

            <text syncTime="1864.956" offset="7563160">Is that to say then Mr. Pollock that whether the exemption shall or shall not be allowed, depends upon the Commissioner's belief whether the period involved is a little more or a little less?</text>

            <label>Mr. Earl E. Pollock</label>
            <text syncTime="1879.934" offset="7623137">I think that the statute requires that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.043" offset="7639542">The -- in fact, this Court even recognized in Flowers case that in connection with living expenses at a particular point as distinguished from expenses incurred while actually traveling, that the stay at this particular point must be temporary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.409" offset="7709027">For example, the -- the Court said in Flowers case that travel expenses in pursuit of business within the meaning of this statute could arise only when the railroads business forced the taxpayer to travel and to live temporarily at some place other than Mobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.937" offset="7779140">The difference, Your Honor, if I -- if I may say, there's a difference between travel expenses which are allowed under Section 23 and living expenses which are forbidden under Section 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.896" offset="7830967">This presents a difficult determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.648" offset="7841938">Now, these taxpayers take the position that the amount of time spent on job is immaterial whether it's 20 and a half months, two years, three years or more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.312" offset="7884570">Panama Canal, for example, took 10 years to build.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.043" offset="7899512">Yet these taxpayers are contending because construction work is in the nature of a temporary employment because sometime the construction job will be finished, that therefore, they are entitled to deduct all of their living expenses during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.029" offset="7959489">And the -- the Commissioner, on the other hand, believes that the -- this deduction for traveling expenses under standards, generally applicable to all taxpayers cannot be expanded to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.644" offset="8025945">Commissioner is faced with the problem of reconciling these two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.686" offset="8042141">Congress clearly had two purposes in mind, and if I may say so, the problem of finding the dividing line is not an easy one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.465" offset="8085191">The problem arises in large measure because the typical taxpayer really lives sort of a double life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.386" offset="8112880">In one sense, he's a seeker after profit, an income producing mechanism, has certain expenses incident to that, yet, in another sense, he is a human being with a customary human needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.837" offset="8166693">For example, we all have to have meals whether we're working or not, whether we're located at the particular time near our residence or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.678" offset="8198040">Now, this -- this kind of double life, this schizophrenia, is recognized in the Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.862" offset="8222804">Here, we have Section 25 which allows to each taxpayer a $600 personal exemption for himself and generally speaking, for each member of his family.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.062" offset="8271600">Then we come to deductions and other provisions of the statute, Section 24 flatly forbids any deduction for personal, living or family expenses, except for extraordinary medical expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.397" offset="8332936">On the other hand, Section 23 (a) (1) (A) allows a deduction for ordinary and necessary traveling expenses including the cost of meals and lodging while away from home in the pursuit of a trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.041" offset="8399496">Now, the problem is to reconcile these two Congressional mandates which are not altogether consistent without doing violence to either one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.632" offset="8441919">The test is in no sense an easy one particularly because of the Commissioner's obligation to apply the statute, so that a deduction is not allowed to one class of employees, which results in an unjust discrimination against other classes of employees who may be very similarly situated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2480.392" offset="10024939">Mr. McCormick, on behalf of proponents of the bill, quoted a great length from the Commissioner's ruling and those who opposed this measure and there was heavy opposition of the measure, particularly in the Senate because it was regarded by those who opposed it as a discriminatory tax advantage in favor of members of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.320" offset="10124622">It was their regard -- regarded as clearly, making a special exception of the definition of home for members of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.074" offset="10159626">Of course, Congress did so because of the special circumstances facing congressmen frequently after maintaining a double residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.314" offset="10192645">But nevertheless, this statute, we think, shows on its face, and particularly in the light of the legislative history, that it was a congressional understanding beyond any doubt that home, within the meaning of the statute, referred to principal place of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.020" offset="10263489">May I say in this connection that the taxpayers have filed a reply brief in response to our memorandum setting forth this legislative history and the petitioners in this brief have set forth certain quotations from the legislative debates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.161" offset="10356067">According to the petitioners, these quotations show just the contrary of what the Government has stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.703" offset="10382190">However, we are real bound to point out that the statements quoted in petitioners' reply brief are taken out of context and tend to distort what actually transpired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.821" offset="10430673">For example, the taxpayers quote Senator Walsh during the 1921 legislative debates as saying that under this travel expense provision that Congressman would be allowed to deduct their expenses while in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.222" offset="10516250">On that basis, the taxpayers say that therefore, the 1952 amendment merely restored what was the original purpose of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.728" offset="10558255">However, the taxpayers have not read quite far enough because on the very same page of the congressional record, Senator Walsh was answered by Senator Watson of Indiana, who was apparently one of the floor managers of the bill, and Senator Watson stated that he had just discussed the matter with three representatives of the Treasury Department on the floor and they had stated to him flatly that the home of a Congressman under the statute would be regarded as Washington and that therefore, Senator Walsh is strictly in error in stating that Congressmen, under the original provision, would be allowed to deduct their expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.622" offset="10753860">We think that if -- if this legislative history is read in context, I believe -- we believe that only one conclusion can come from there and that is Congress has accepted this Congress -- this consistent interpretation by the Commissioner and by the Tax Court, and as I say, by every Court of Appeals, which has passed on in question ever since this Court's Flowers decision.</text>
