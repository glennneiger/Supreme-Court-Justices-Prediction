            <text syncTime="2835.298" offset="11444537">Before I start my argument, I would like to again remind the Court that Mr. Paul Weaver, who was a prosecuting attorney of Vanderburgh County at the time of the trial of Leslie Irvin, is in the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.352" offset="11508799">Now, the reason for his presence here is because of the nature of personal attack levied against him and because of the statements made by Chief Judge Duffy in the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit that Mr. Weaver requested that he be permitted to come with us and talk to us concerning the handling of this case in this Court, although it is the duty of the Attorney General of Indiana to handle the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2947.394" offset="11892903">And in the Seventh Circuit, we have the case of United States ex rel. Touhy versus Ragen decided in 1955 by Chief Judge Duffy, as Chief Judge Duffy wrote the deciding opinion in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3201.237" offset="12908335">He then has 90 days within which to file a transcript in the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.329" offset="12924740">The Supreme Court then would consider his appeal based upon an assignment of error which act as a complaint in our Court on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.230" offset="12968312">The assignment of error, one of those things which may be assigned is the ruling of the Court on the motion for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.847" offset="13002794">Now, that was the situation -- that situation would afford a remedy in Indiana to any person convicted as Leslie Irvin was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.112" offset="13039783">Now, let us examine the facts to see why the State maintains that Leslie Irvin did not afford himself of that remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.024" offset="13079489">The conviction or the verdict of the jury was rendered on the 19th day or the 20th day of December of 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.518" offset="13125465">The last day for the filing, as had been pointed out here, where -- of a motion for new trial was on the 19th day of January 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.742" offset="13166320">On the 18th day of January 1956, Leslie Irvin escaped, and I insist on using those words if I may digress for a moment here and -- and that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.568" offset="13217625">There, the time element was regulated by snowfall which -- and there were no tracks and so the time was fairly well fixed as before midnight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.535" offset="13249494">Leslie Irvin manufactured, if you please, a key from cardboard and so forth and -- and opened the locks of the jail door.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.467" offset="13281259">Now, about that, I -- I realized it's outside of the record, but if I may say it to explain the language of his letter that his -- his letter in stating that he had done the wrong thing and he would return was a letter written advisedly knowing that everyone concerned was well aware of the factual situation concerning his escape and his absence in the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.179" offset="13376136">Now, the question was raised, “Is the letter the only evidence of his escape?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.424" offset="13401109">We say that the letter is not the only evidence to -- it's in -- in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.317" offset="13416678">It is not the only evidence, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.636" offset="13425873">The sheriff of the Court who had charged of the man and who is an arm of the Court and a duty to inform the Court of the goings on concerning the custody of the prisoners, did in open Court and it is in the record, informed the Judge on the two occasions that the defendant was absent and that he had escaped from the jail, his whereabouts were unknown.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.495" offset="13513331">Now, Leslie Irvin therefore escaped on the 18th of January.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.380" offset="13544887">On the morning of the 19th of January, his attorney's appeared in Court to present the motion for new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.405" offset="13572995">Simultaneously, the sheriff appeared in Court and informed the Court the defendant was gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.751" offset="13598386">The attorneys, nevertheless, filed the motion for new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.204" offset="13616149">Now, they say that no question was raised concerning their ability to do that, that it was not objected to, they had no right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.970" offset="13643212">I'd like the Court to bear in mind the time had not yet expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.292" offset="13652511">This was the last day, but it was early in the last day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.256" offset="13664423">It's presumed -- presumed I -- I believe that if Leslie Irvin hadn't shown up voluntarily or involuntarily and being presented in court sometime that day, that he would have been before the Court and would have had a proper motion before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.745" offset="13734327">So the Court I think rightly entertained the motion and took it under advisement at the time it was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.671" offset="13766092">Now, later on the 23rd of January, the Court again took the matter up, again the sheriff came in and advised that this man was not yet in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.199" offset="13820217">He was still at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.098" offset="13827741">At that time, the letter which we have just discussed was put in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.654" offset="13849997">And there upon, the Court overruled the motion for new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.705" offset="13882180">Now, and we take the position that that was all he could do under the circumstances, under the authority as Indiana has two old cases on it and which are cited in my brief at page 11, Sutherland versus State and Sargent versus State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.610" offset="13953860">And incidentally, Sargent versus State is quoted in Allen versus Georgia by this Court, quoted with approval to the proposition that a person -- while an escapee has no standing in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.053" offset="14011538">Now, later, the petitioner was arrested in California, was returned to the State of Indiana and started his time or -- well, he didn't start time, this is a death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.140" offset="14083950">He was incarcerated way out to a week, the death sentence in the Indiana State Prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.047" offset="14111535">Within time, the attorney as concerning and considering the extensions of time which were granted by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.647" offset="14145912">The attorneys for Leslie Irvin filed their record in the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.145" offset="14163989">Now, it is true that still no objection to their so filing of the record was made by the State of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.320" offset="14196694">They were permitted to file that record and address a brief to that record to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.357" offset="14228773">We, in turn after an extension of time which I think is quite understandable, even of the voluminous nature of his brief, filed our own brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.660" offset="14270046">And the first proposition which we set forth in the brief is for his proposition which we must consider here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.644" offset="14293974">Did Leslie Irvin file a proper motion for a new trial, the assignment of error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.520" offset="14317484">The only assignment of error in the Supreme Court of Indiana, was the ruling of the Court on the motion for new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.552" offset="14349563">We took the position that the Court ruled properly in overruling the motion for a new trial because Leslie Irvin was not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.979" offset="14391254">Now --</text>
