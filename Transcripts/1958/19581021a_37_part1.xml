            <text syncTime="176.224" offset="808312">It's also undisputed that substantial amount of their work is for the Federal Government, most of it is for Governmental agencies.</text>

            <text syncTime="252.341" offset="1112691">They employ about 65 to 70 employees, including professional and non-professional, about 30 in the Norfolk office and about 20 in the Washington office and from 15 to 20 employees overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.254" offset="1180400">I want to emphasize it because I think there's some confusion over the professional exemption and may have been responsible for the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.424" offset="1213106">But the case is concerned only with respondents of non-professional employees, not with professional architects and engineers to which qualify on this specific exemption in the Act for any employee employed in a bona fide professional capacity of those terms are defined and diminutive by regulations of the administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.904" offset="1298996">Respondents admittedly employ quite a number of employees as clerks and (Inaudible) field men and routine draftsmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.381" offset="1336926">And these employees engage in all of the interstate activities that are necessary to conduct the two-state businesses with an out-of-state clientele and overseas clientele.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.791" offset="1394500">And there's no question but what that requires constant and practice both courts below noticed that requires constant interstate communication and transmission of information and documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.229" offset="1456253">Now, the Government's position is that there's no question but what the activities of these employees, their regular and substantial activities, constitute both engagement in commerce and production of goods for commerce within the literal terms of the Act and within the intent -- the legislative intent in enacting those broad terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.953" offset="1571192">The court below with three separate -- three general separate grounds and several subsidiary grounds on which our contention is based and withdrawn fully into the judicial, legislative and statutory authority for each of those grounds in our brief, I'm afraid are now beyond and obviously the time for oral argument would not permit going into them in detail here.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.861" offset="1694804">But I believe that the -- the best way to approach the -- the issue here is to consider the basis of the decision of the court below because I think it's the same basic reasoning explained their ruling on each particular grounds of coverage which the Government advanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.260" offset="1800443">And there, the reasoning of the Court was that none of these employees -- none of the employees of this firm were engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce within the Act despite their findings and their recognition of all their interstate activities of individual employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.870" offset="1878810">That none of them was within the coverage of the Act because it viewed architectural engineering work, preparation of plans and specifications as to use this term in essentially local business, an independent enterprise which was engaged in an essentially local business and that any interstate activities that were required to carry on that essentially local business but took the local character and were not -- there was no -- there was no intent despite the language, the broad language of the statute, there was no intent to cover interstate activities which are merely incidental to an otherwise local enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.043" offset="2063548">Now, we think that the error of that approach is clear beyond doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.820" offset="2094686">The Court indicated that it realized that both the statute and that the decisions of this Court has settled the principle that the coverage of this act is to be determined not by the employer business or by the nature of this business but by the particular duties of the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.504" offset="2185383">The Congress intended that any employee who was regularly engaged in interstate activities within the statutory definition and it said any and each employee should be paid the standard of the Act and that this principle applied even though the employer's business and I think I'm quoting, “even though the employer was not engaged in an industry for taking of interstate commerce.”</text>
            <text syncTime="562.096" offset="2351731">The Court was also obviously influenced, the court below, by the professional -- by the fact that it felt that professional work is necessarily -- necessarily local apparently.</text>

            <label>Ms. Bessie Margolin</label>
            <text syncTime="585.908" offset="2447026">No, the District Court went almost entirely off on the (Inaudible) decision which the -- the District Court of Maryland, and also on the grounds that work for military installations could not be within the scope of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.832" offset="2526751">The Court of Appeals didn't say anything about either on those grounds because I think it was perfectly clear that this Court's decision in Powell took any thunder out of the argument that because work is (Inaudible) it cannot be for commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.758" offset="2614418">The Court of Appeals did though follow the lower court to the extent of adopting the reasoning of the -- of the Maryland District Court decision that goods does not include plans and specifications because they are not ordinarily sold commercially to the public generally, and were not articles -- that they represented just the embodiment of the idea and plan to get to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.152" offset="2743986">I did want to make it clear though that all three of the grounds of coverage, any one of the three separately would be sufficient to hold these employees, if you look it to the activities of the employees, with this or either anyone of the grounds will be sufficient to bring them within the coverage of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.630" offset="2829876">And so that it is apparent that the Court necessarily went off on an erroneous concept in order to reach the conclusion, it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.341" offset="2876688">Because, if it had looked to the activities of the employee, apparently it considered that the activities of the employees were wholly irrelevant that since this was at this unit and as we say, it's contradicted by the record that it certainly is not a local, essentially a local enterprise with it's two-state organization, its overseas association, its out-of-state clientele, and it's out-of-state projects and its constant transmission of information materials across the State lines that the Court's basic -- factual assumption is contradicted by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.563" offset="3061635">But, even if the Court was factually correct and if it were an essentially local business, it would not follow that the employees engaged in the activity -- in interstate activities necessary to conduct that business would be outside the scope of the Act provided that they perform their duties were regularly were the intestate activity and not simply a sporadic and occasional.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.835" offset="3178663">Now we don't claim that because an employee occasionally has to write letters to out-of -- to out-of-the-state for an essentially local business and an occasional sporadic intestate communication brings him in within the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.508" offset="3241357">But we do claim that where his regular and substantial duty requires continuous and regular use of the intestate channels or activities specifically related to intestate instrumentality, then, he is within the coverage of the Act even though substantial part or most of the employer's business may not be covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.547" offset="3361520">Now, they -- we think it's significant that of all the numerous decisions of this Court on construing the coverage of this Act, that the only one in which the court below found anything that seemed to substantiate its decision was 10 E 40th Street, Decatur.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.731" offset="3450337">Now that was the office building's maintenance employee's case which this Court distinguished from the Kirschbaum case, the Kirchbaum being the earliest decision construing the coverage of this Act where the Court first announced the employee test of coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.668" offset="3534033">And where the Court applied it there to an independent enterprise whose business was certainly no more essentially local than the business and it's certainly more essentially local than the business here because it was maintenance of a -- of a building and rental and maintenance of the building in New York City and in Kirschbaum, the Court held that the maintenance employees' activities were within the coverage of the Act despite the fact that their employer was an independent enterprise and not himself engaged in intestate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.459" offset="3701217">Now, the case that the court below relied on was the Callus case which this Court distinguished in a five to four decision I might add on the basis that the evidence of the relationship to intestate production as a tenant was too thin in Callus.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.186" offset="3776136">And it was too thin because none of the tenants carried on any production in the building and the claim of relationship to commerce being only that the few of the tenants elsewhere carried on for the manufacturing activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.186" offset="3848129">We think that the fact that the court below found it necessary to rely primarily on that decision, if not solely, is indicative of the error of its reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.933" offset="3895150">It -- it was impressed apparently with some particular language and particular language it was impressed with in that case was the independent enterprise -- that Callus was an independent enterprise serving a general miscellaneous customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.330" offset="3972681">Well, that language does appear in there and undoubtedly, that was one of the aspects of the case which led the Court to think that the – to rule, this Court to rule that the maintenance of the building was too remote from the commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.724" offset="4042271">But there is absolutely nothing else in the Callus decision which is at all applicable to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.408" offset="4076962">In Callus, neither the employer nor the employees were engaged directly in any interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.808" offset="4130565">It was just the same relationship which was all that was urged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.977" offset="4147284">And if that language -- if that language cannot be taken out as a test of determining coverage of employees who were directly engaged in interstate activity, it's clear beyond doubt from the numerous decisions both from this Court and all of too many lower court decisions even to cite, holding the Act applicable to employees of businesses which are independent enterprises and which serve a general miscellany of customers.</text>
