            <label>Mr. Dwight L. Schwab</label>
            <text syncTime="69.031" offset="379486">The Compensation Act grants to the employee a substitute remedy under these circumstances where the Act had been rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.589" offset="421700">Now, the question is, is the employee prevented by the United States Constitution from exercising that substitute remedy?</text>
            <text syncTime="89.459" offset="461197">The Oregon Supreme Court says, “Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.440" offset="473109">An employee in circumstances like that has no state remedy whatsoever.”</text>
            <text syncTime="102.422" offset="513024">In this case, the plaintiff, Harry Hahn worked for the defendant, respondent, Ross Island Sand &amp; Gravel Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.861" offset="550849">Ross Island Sand &amp; Gravel Company incidentally is an Oregon corporation which operates in the Portland area, dredging up sand and gravel and selling it in the Portland area for commercial purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.668" offset="602049">The plaintiff in this case was hurt on March 23rd, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.865" offset="622843">Prior to the injury of the plaintiff, the defendant Ross Island had rejected the State Workmen's Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.393" offset="660982">Now, in Oregon, the state act is elected and -- however, where a hazardous occupation is involved, which this was, the employer automatically comes under the Act until he rejects it, but he may reject it at anytime by a very simple method of writing a letter to the Commission saying, “I reject the Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="164.914" offset="763068">Now, in the event the employer of this kind does reject the Act, he is subject, in the event, a workman is injured to an action for negligence with the common defenses of a fellow servant, assumption of risk, contribute -- contributory negligence removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.557" offset="853556">I think this is rather common in all of the elective acts and there are about 25 elective acts in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.029" offset="879470">He also, in Oregon in addition, the employer who rejects is also subject to an action pursuant to the Employers' Liability Act, the Oregon Employers' Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.430" offset="929102">Now, both of these sanctions against the rejecting employer are provided for by the Workmen's Compensation Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.537" offset="969540">In other words, the -- instead of the Act, you can say, “If you don't comply with it, you will as a rejecting employer be subject to the following actions in the case you are negligent.”</text>

            <text syncTime="236.096" offset="1047803">I think it's one or -- either one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.090" offset="1063685">Now, that's the basis of this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.100" offset="1071731">It's a negligence action based on the Oregon Workmen's Compensation Act, the allegations of the complaint are set out on page two of the record and the employee in this case alleged negligence on the part of the employer and he also alleged violation of the Employers' Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.575" offset="1161697">The case was -- was filed in the Oregon Circuit Court, which is the court of general jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.093" offset="1187715">The employer in this case answered by alleging that the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers Act was the exclusive remedy of this employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.526" offset="1233481">And of course, we denied that.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.400" offset="1241004">It was tried to a jury and there was jury verdict in the amount of $38,242 plus cost and judgment was entered on that verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.348" offset="1280815">The employer then moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the grounds that the Longshoremen Act was the exclusive remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.900" offset="1311013">The trial court granted that motion and the judgment was set aside on the exclusive grounds that the Longshoremen Act was the exclusive remedy of this employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.133" offset="1347897">We appeal this to the Oregon Supreme Court, which affirmed on the ground, as far as I can get it from the Courts of Opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.981" offset="1379244">One, the Congress had preempted this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.822" offset="1390634">And two, although the Oregon Supreme Court recognized the twilight zone as being in existence, they held that under the twilight zone, you could only recover pure -- 100% pure compensation and nothing else, just merely workmen's compensation payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.426" offset="1477047">We petitioned for rehearing and that was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.924" offset="1487078">We petitioned for certiorari to this Court which was granted June 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.710" offset="1506200">Now, the facts of the case are as follows and I think they're important.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.651" offset="1521977">I'll go into some detail on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.100" offset="1535770">Our contention is that Harry Hahn, the plaintiff here was a twilight zone employee and that the defendant in this case was merely of basic elementary negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.723" offset="1578297">Now, the reason I say that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.066" offset="1591672">That there are still some contention in this case that the Oregon Employers' Liability Act places some sort of burden on uniform view of Maritime Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.232" offset="1636289">Now, I want to point out right at the beginning that this employer was guilty of the most basic elementary negligence as the record shows from the undisputed evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.299" offset="1688534">Now, concerning Ross Island Sand &amp; Gravel Company, as I say Ross Island Sand &amp; Gravel Company was in the sand and gravel business.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.360" offset="1716851">They've been dredging up sand and gravel for years and selling it commercially in the Portland area.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.892" offset="1738898">If, Your Honors, would care turn to page 85 of the transcript of record, I think it might possibly help in the understanding of the facts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.942" offset="1787173">There is a -- an exhibit set out, Exhibit Number 4 -- displays Exhibit Number 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.465" offset="1825207">Now, in the middle of -- of Exhibit Number 4, you'll notice the river there, that's the Willamette River.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.513" offset="1857390">This in the heart of Portland, Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.563" offset="1869615">You see the island there, on one part of it, it says Ross.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.764" offset="1886438">Well, this all Ross Island, including this whole Horseshoe.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.727" offset="1902320">Down below, it says Hardtack, but actually it's all part of Ross Island, part of it -- it's all Ross Island, part of it is sometimes called Hardtack Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.232" offset="1940250">Now, inside of Ross Island, you'll notice a lagoon and that's where this action all took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.090" offset="1979747">Where you see the X mark in the lagoon, that is the spot where the plaintiff, Hahn, did his regular work.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.769" offset="2010467">That's where they were dredging.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.642" offset="2021961">At the place where you see the circle, the zero of the eight circle, that is the spot where Hahn is injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.866" offset="2062817">Now, that circle there is right next to what was know as the rock pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.060" offset="2079640">That's where all the sand and gravel was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.792" offset="2090506">When it was dredged up out of the lagoon, it was put through the rock pressure and then it was belted.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.648" offset="2125928">There was a -- some of these belts, the tramways that took all of the sand and gravel over to the mainland, which you'll notice off to the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.392" offset="2172949">Now, the defendant, Ross Island owns all of Ross Island, including that lagoon area, including everything under the lagoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.324" offset="2208684">They own it in fee simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.296" offset="2216521">It was patented by the United States Government in 1873 and deeded the Ross Island Sand &amp; Gravel Company in 1926.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.461" offset="2253197">If, Your Honors, will notice that the -- as far as Exhibit 1 is concerned on page 83, there -- it shows Ross Island there with a red circle around it.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.814" offset="2290604">It stipulated that all of that area, including the lagoon was owned by Ross Island Sand &amp; Gravel Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.902" offset="2314951">You'll notice that the lagoon itself is cul-de-sac.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.587" offset="2325713">In other words, you can only get in on the north end and there was no other way to get in or out.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.449" offset="2357164">Now, all of Ross Island Sand &amp; Gravel Company's product came from the lagoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.249" offset="2380361">It was put on a barge where it was dredged up.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.827" offset="2390706">It was taken over a short distance to the rock pressure, which you'll note there in the lagoon on Exhibit 4 and then there was a conveyor belt where it was taken up to shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.128" offset="2431875">They've done a lot of digging there.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.566" offset="2437622">They've completely altered Ross Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.945" offset="2451101">If the Court cares to compare Exhibit D which appears on 101 of the record with Exhibit 4, the Court will notice the alterations that have been made in there by Ross Island Sand &amp; Gravel Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.567" offset="2501674">Originally, in 1895, Exhibit D shows that the depths in the lagoon area were some eight or nine feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.936" offset="2527065">Record shows that some depths in the lagoon is now over a 100 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.260" offset="2544410">Now, the defendant operates this lagoon as it pleases.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.439" offset="2569174">It has complete jurisdiction over the lagoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.518" offset="2577429">It takes no orders from anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.632" offset="2585893">There are hundreds of piling driven throughout the lagoon, cement tiers and anchors.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.492" offset="2609298">They have erected towers for this tramway to take their product to the mainland.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.619" offset="2637824">If the Court cares to have a close up of those towers, Exhibit 10 on page 87 or Exhibit 89 -- Exhibit 25 on page 89 will give the Court an idea of how they have built these towers right out in the middle of the only entrance to the lagoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.306" offset="2716609">They've built the pressure plant which is very large in the lagoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.152" offset="2735940">They've put hundreds of pilings under that pressure plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.483" offset="2749315">They rent space in the lagoon regularly to log graph.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.585" offset="2765720">Any of this exhibits here, you'll notice all log graph in the lagoon and that's a very profitable business.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.814" offset="2794663">They -- they rent so much space in the lagoon at times that it's almost impossible to do anything else in the lagoon, to move around in there to -- even to conduct their dredging operations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1115.624" offset="4565870">Hahn was told to go over there in connection with this changing the hopper from one barge to another.</text>

            <text syncTime="1163.707" offset="4758235">Now, the evidence shows that he received no warning of the condition of the hopper and that the top of the hopper where the ladder was fastened was so rocking that it just couldn't hold the ladder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.219" offset="4808286">It was -- the ladder was nailed which was in violation of safety rules, which of the course of law in Oregon and there's just no question that there was elementary negligence in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1211.841" offset="4950706">After a while, the Jensen doctrine was sought and somewhat by the local concerned rule, but this Court found after a number of years of attempting to split hairs that a lot of hardship was being caused and that it was being required to -- to determine from a factual standpoint, a lot of cases and the Court finally decided that it the should not go any further on that and the twilight zone was born.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.946" offset="5071182">The Court considered, I believe, and decided not to overrule the Jensen case, although I believe it was seriously considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.712" offset="5102216">But in order to prevent hardship, this Court set up, of course, the twilight zone in which the workmen's choice of remedy, whether the state or federal law was -- the Court said would be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.000" offset="5163342">If the workmen went in in this twilight zone, in this area of doubt shows you the state law or federal law, his choice should be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.761" offset="5194376">Now, in this case, I don't think there's any question that this employee is -- falls within the twilight zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.189" offset="5232097">I think the Court is familiar with the -- with the facts in the Davis case, the Baskin case, the Morris case and a simple comparison of the facts, I think, will show that this employee did fall within the twilight zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.326" offset="5288626">Furthermore, it was a matter purely of local concern in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.298" offset="5308583">And even before the twilight zone was setup, this employee could have recovered under the local concerned doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.454" offset="5353200">Now, it's true that in this case, the petitioner is not getting pure compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.966" offset="5375248">But I -- I want to emphasize again that what he was he has asked for in this case was provided by the Compensation Law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1357.610" offset="5533863">Now, this Court in the Davis case set up -- not set up, but reaffirmed, I should probably say, the presumption of constitutionality of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.932" offset="5575137">And this is of course is purely a constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.834" offset="5586735">Can Oregon apply its laws in this particular situation?</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.423" offset="5601050">And of course, the Court said in the Davis case, that prima facie, every state is entitled to enforce in its own courts its own statutes lawfully enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.223" offset="5640234">Now, that -- incidentally, that presumption of constitutionality was not discussed by the Oregon Court in its decision and has not been discussed but the respondent in its briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.252" offset="5680358">The Oregon Court in its decision relied on cases such as Pennsylvania Railroad Company versus O'Rourke which was decided by this Court some five or six years ago in 330 -- 344 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.919" offset="5735006">The O'Rourke case, in our opinion, is completely inapplicable to this situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.163" offset="5764054">That was purely a case of statutory construction and the Court so stated in Footnote 8 of its opinion, purely statutory construction between two federal acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.748" offset="5806373">This of course is a constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.654" offset="5829987">The Court relied -- the Oregon Court relied on certain language in the O'Rourke case to the effect that New Jersey could not have provided compensation for this injured work on navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.571" offset="5869693">Well, obviously, New Jersey could not have done that because the injured workmen in that case was a railroad worker and of course, there's no question that no state can apply its compensation laws to a railroad worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.241" offset="5924342">I don't -- the Oregon Court is not the only court that has misinterpreted the O'Rourke case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.667" offset="5942000">It's been misinterpreted by other courts and the respondent here relies heavily on a -- on a Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals case and filed a supplemental brief in connection with that case, which this case was decided recently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.297" offset="5996544">I believe there's a New Jersey case in which the O'Rourke case was also misconstrued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.100" offset="6023816">As far as the Fifth Circuit of Appeals is concerned and the Oregon Supreme Court, I think the answer is that those courts do like the twilight zone or the Davis doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.264" offset="6068433">It's just a situation of those court not liking that solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.537" offset="6085569">They like the cut and dried proposition that was set out in the Parker versus Motor Boat Sales case where you just draw a straight line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.066" offset="6119633">But of course, the Parker case must be construed in connection with the Davis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.235" offset="6140322">Now, under the Davis case, the Court said under the Jensen hypothesis basic conditions are factual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.757" offset="6170415">Does the state law interfere with the proper harmony and uniformity of Maritime Law?</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.913" offset="6195075">If the state law does not interfere with proper harmony in uniform with the maritime law, then of course the state has a right to apply its own law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.928" offset="6235094">Now, I have been in connection with this case from the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.563" offset="6261635">This man was hurt in 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.339" offset="6268740">I've been through three courts with this case and I'm still unable to figure out how, allowing this injured workman to recover this judgement which he received in the Oregon Court is going to under the facts interfere with the uniformity of Maritime Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.890" offset="6370931">It's argued that the Jensen that -- that under the Oregon Law, under the Employers' Liability Act that there's two high standard of care.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.261" offset="6412413">Now, there is no higher standard of care than Workmen's Compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.674" offset="6426102">That's a liability without fault and yet there is not question in the twilight zone, Workmen's Compensation is proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.832" offset="6462673">If the Employers' Liability Act has a lesser standard of care and of course the ludicrous thing about the whole thing is that the case that setup this entire doctrine, the Jensen case, talking about interfering with the uniformity of Maritime Law was based on the Jensen case which was a workmen's compensation statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.057" offset="6559640">And yet, there is no question now that workmen's compensation can be -- laws can be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.203" offset="6592136">Furthermore, there's a lot situation in Maritime Law where there is a very high standard of care.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.213" offset="6616273">In fact, liability without fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.294" offset="6636544">And of course, in this case as I pointed out before and I would like to say it again, under the fact, this employer was guilty of plain ordinary -- regarding a variety of negligence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1699.648" offset="6901948">Now, they cite Gilmore and Black, where Gilmore and Black suggest that there's no twilight zone between the Longshore Act and the Employers Liability -- Federal Employers' Liability Act, the Jones Act and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.775" offset="6958477">And suggest that the reason is because this Court doesn't want to subject an employer to that -- the difference between a Compensation Act at one end and a jury verdict on the another end, which they can do nothing to protect themselves against.</text>

            <text syncTime="2085.623" offset="8445889">We show in our brief that 25% to 40% of the workers in this country are not covered by compensation and an awful lot of those people at sometime or another and maybe all the time comes within the twilight zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.285" offset="8504508">You can just let your imaginations run as to all the different situations where all these workers would come in to the twilight zone at sometime or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.465" offset="8537213">Now, just because all of those people are not covered by state compensation, does that mean that they are -- all of them to be completely deprived of all of their state remedies?</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.176" offset="8580054">This case holds that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.228" offset="8588309">In Oregon, there is over 2000 miles of navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.974" offset="8607222">Now, some states don't have that much and some have more and there's 100 of employers, small employers, big employers along those navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.027" offset="8647450">Now, all the employees of those people to -- to be -- to be deprived of all their state remedies if they reject the Act of if they aren't covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.244" offset="8680364">As I say, there's 25% to 40% of the workers in this country that are not covered by any kind of workmen's compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.420" offset="8705024">A lot of these employers, the small employers, the loggers, the farmers who float their produce down the river and saw it never heard of the Longshoremen's Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.010" offset="8735431">They haven't complied with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.052" offset="8743581">A lot of them wouldn't think they were covered under if they had heard of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.466" offset="8761240">I think it's 30% of the people in this country don't even know who the president of the United States is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.424" offset="8781093">Now, workmen's compensation, this Court, I think, everyone agrees and practically is a good thing and there's a lot of non-negligent injuries where people should be covered by workmen's compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.839" offset="8842742">But employers, some of them, a lot of them, look at it only from a coal dollar and cent standpoint and they like to avoid the expense of taking out workmen's compensation if they can.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.029" offset="8891538">So, in order to make these employers comply with Compensation Acts, it's necessary to have coercive measures in the Compensation Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.177" offset="8932080">And that's exactly what they have in the Oregon Act, and the reason that it's put in there is clearly and only to force these employers to comply with the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.430" offset="8973040">Now, under the decision of the Oregon Supreme Court, the employers are encouraged to reject the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.222" offset="9008253">Because they can reject the Act and then if they do reject the Act, they don't come under any of the alternate provisions of the sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.145" offset="9039914">So it's a good example of a man having his cake after he had already eaten.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.598" offset="9057782">They can reject the Act and completely avoid liability under state law by rejecting the Act and the Oregon Supreme Court encourages that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.416" offset="9097070">I say that the decision of the Oregon Supreme Court is illogical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.524" offset="9121520">And if you allow the Oregon Supreme Court's decision to stand, you are allowing an employer to unilaterally make a constitutional determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.799" offset="9158614">In other words, the employer, if he complies with the Oregon Compensation Act, allows his employees -- his employees unconstitutionally come under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.101" offset="9195813">On the other hand, if this decision stands and that employer rejects the Compensation Act, he is constitutionally deciding that none of his employees are subject to state law and I'd say that is a ridiculous situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.892" offset="9266970">There are over two million industrial accidents a year and any decision like this, which encourages employers to reject Compensation Acts should be scrutinized with a great deal of care because this case encourages an employer to reject the Compensation Act.</text>
