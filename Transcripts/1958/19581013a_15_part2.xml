            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Mr. Ginnane you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert W. Ginnane</label>
            <text syncTime="10.837" offset="146683">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.661" offset="157968">In this case the commission authorized to Frisco, a wholly owned subsidiary of a railroad, to acquire the motor carrier operating rights of four existing motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.674" offset="218049">Now Section 5(2)(b) of the Interstate Commerce Act provides that such acquisitions by a railroad or its affiliate maybe authorized by the commission if the commission finds that the proposed acquisitions not only are in the public interest but also will enable such railroad carrier to use service by motor vehicle to public advantage in its operations and will not unduly restrain competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.316" offset="340616">Now this congressional policy against unlimited motor carrier operations by railroads has been before this Court several times.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.598" offset="377814">Specifically in the first Rock Island Motor Transit case in 340 United States this Court held that to carry out this congressional policy, the commission in authorizing such an acquisition by rail affiliate may insert in the certificate which it issues to the rail affiliate a reservation of power to impose future conditions necessary to ensure that the motor carrier service remains auxiliary and supplemental to the train service of the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.264" offset="500381">And also just this last term in the American Trucking Association case, this Court held that while the commission may authorize unrestricted motor carrier operations in special circumstances that its action in doing so must be supported by appropriate findings and edits.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert W. Ginnane</label>
            <text syncTime="129.692" offset="622111">The commission has taken the position in several cases that it may -- even under 5(2)(b) it may authorize unrestricted operations in special circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.184" offset="680103">A feature of this case is that it did not purport to do so.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="147.466" stopTime="153.216">
            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="147.466" offset="693269">You are going to distinguish the Watson case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_w_ginnane" startTime="153.216" stopTime="461.589">
            <label>Mr. Robert W. Ginnane</label>
            <text syncTime="153.216" offset="716257">Well briefly we take the distinction there as it is and a major feature in that case which is absent here is that there the commission purported to correct or modify a certificate without opportunity for a hearing to the certificate holder.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.465" offset="777279">Here there has been a hearing, hearings and due process to the extent of some years.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.076" offset="803715">In other words, when the commission acts to authorize a rail affiliate to acquire motor carrier operating rights, act to define the scope of the operations when it permits, its actions must be supported by findings, and the law is clear in the absence of such findings the courts upon challenge will set aside the commission's orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.266" offset="908413">At the same time these proceedings are not just a matter between the commission and Frisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.677" offset="938088">Competing independent motor carriers have a right to be heard before the commission, they have a right to challenge the commission's orders in the courts and we think they are entitled to assume that the findings and conditions set forth in the commission's reports fairly describe the action which it's about to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.282" offset="1020531">Now the four certificates involved in this case were issued on the basis of three reports of the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.794" offset="1050520">And it's undisputed that in each report the commission, Division 5, made the findings required by Section 5(2)(b) where the acquisition is by a rail affiliate.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.068" offset="1099630">And that at each report these crucial findings were made subject to a reservation of power to impose the future conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.505" offset="1137351">No later report of the commission or of any division of the commission ever purported to modify or vacate those findings or the proviso reservation which was a part of the findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.744" offset="1198373">The requirements of hearings and findings are valuable procedural rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.887" offset="1218957">And where the commission acts after a hearing required by law and makes findings required by law, it disclaims any power to make a farce out of the hearing and out of the findings by taking action that substantially differs from the findings, to issue a certificate that differs substantially from the findings that are made in the commission's report.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.910" offset="1314983">Rather the commission believes that when such a matter is discovered, called to its attention, it has both the power and duty to correct the certificate to confirm with the findings as required by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.012" offset="1367437">Now we submit that every tribunal, court, or administrative agency inherently has this power to put back the integrity of its proceedings and the case of the courts, rule 68 or the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is express that clerical mistakes in judgments orders or other parts of the record and errors therein arising from oversight or omission maybe corrected by the court at any time of its own initiative or on the motion of any party and after such notice if any as the court orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.336" offset="1504737">Section 17(3) of the Interstate Commerce Act provides that the commission shall conduct its proceedings under any provision of law in such manner as we are conduced to the proper dispatch of business and the ends of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.823" offset="1558653">Now we submit that under this provision the commission has the same power of a court to correct clerical errors in its orders and certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.484" offset="1597315">In our brief, we call attention to other cases, other examples in which the commission has occasion to correct obvious error in certificates of public opinions and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.884" offset="1646947">An example which is not in our brief, but which illustrates the point more sharply than any which we do mention, the commission once issued a certificate authorizing service among other points to Norris Town, New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.306" offset="1704626">There is no Norris Town in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.348" offset="1716746">Well the section of certificates that it would be helpful and clarify the matter so they issued the certificate, Morristown, New Jersey, a substantial industrial center, but to point for which the applicant had not even asked authority to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.348" offset="1784769">Finally the commission issued a supplemental report in a new certificate reading as it should have been from the beginning Norristown, Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.728" offset="1830327">Now the commission grants in whole or in part, even at the present time, about 2000 applications for permanent certificates and licenses a year and back in the 1940s the annual volume was more.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.452" offset="1881213">Occasional mistakes, crude silly mistakes occasionally will happen and we think it's in the public interest and fairness to parties that the commission should be able to correct such mistakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.694" offset="1946102">Now --</text>

            <text syncTime="494.296" offset="2080580">When the Bennett certificate was issued by the commission section of certificates, the Bennett certificate contained the reservation of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.825" offset="2118719">The Rose case is no longer -- the Rose certificate is no longer involved here because under the peculiar facts of those cases -- of that case the commission waived the limitation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert W. Ginnane</label>
            <text syncTime="518.524" offset="2177442">As I recall it wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.878" offset="2190921">Now in the Seatrain case back in 329 U.S., this Court specifically refrained from passing up on the question of whether the commission has power to correct errors in certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.691" offset="2250167">In the mean time the District Court and judges that have dealt with the matter have divided.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.032" offset="2275453">The court below in this case, with Judge Moore dissenting, apparently believed that Section 212(a) of the Interstate Commerce Act precludes the commission from revoking or modifying a certificate for the purpose of correcting errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.631" offset="2341909">Now the text of 212(a) is set forth at Pages 32 and 33 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.060" offset="2367613">As pertinent here Section 212(a) does two things, first it provides that certificates, permits, and licenses shall be effective from the date specified therein and shall remain in effect until suspended or terminated as herein provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.855" offset="2438771">Now clearly that provision is intended to provide finality and stability for properly issued certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.070" offset="2471685">We think it's distorted if it's read to prevent the correction of errors in certificates, errors which can impair the value and the stability of other outstanding certificates in the hands of competing carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.648" offset="2525915">And we think there is no reason to believe that Congress intended to give greater finality to certificates against correction of error than it gives to judgments under Rule 68 of the Rules of Civil Procedure or to these which everywhere today tend to reform to eliminate obvious errors.</text>

            <text syncTime="626.642" offset="2609925">I read the District Court's opinion little differently than perhaps the state did.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.277" offset="2628524">I thought that the premise, the majority of District Court was that the commission -- the evidence was showed that the commission had not acted (Inaudible) that the certificate had not -- issued incorrect and therefore 212 came into play.</text>

            <text syncTime="655.076" offset="2723715">It seem to us that probably they were holding and I am not sure but probably they were holding that correction of a certificate once issued amounted pro tanto to a modification or revocation prohibited by Section 212(a).</text>

            <text syncTime="1231.281" offset="5028446">And we submit therefore that it will pointless to interpret 212(a), as precluding the commission from voluntarily correcting its own errors, but the same, even though we recognize an obvious error, we must wait until a suit is brought in court, until judicial action compels us to clean up the situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1284.641" offset="5241919">The second thing that Section 212(a) has is to prohibit the suspension, modification or revocation of certificates, except for willful failure to comply with the act or with the commission's rules or orders under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.832" offset="5298657">Now we submit that this delineation of the grounds on which certificates can be modified or revoked, relates only to the substantive ground for revocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.108" offset="5351842">We think as this Court suggested in Seatrain, that it protects the holder of a certificate, against retroactive changes in commission policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.633" offset="5393951">But we don't think it was ever intended to preclude the correction of errors, which if the Commission doesn't correct itself, the courts will surely do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.821" offset="5434702">Now we think the proper concept of Section 212(a) was suggested by this Court last term in the Nelson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.594" offset="5473782">That was a case in which there was a disagreement between the commission and the carrier, as to the proper interpretation of a certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.828" offset="5506696">And always as in such interpretation problems, the carrier claims that the Commission by its interpretation is modifying the certificate in violation of 212(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.319" offset="5548596">And to that contention and that case, this Court said, it is true of course that limitations and commission power to modify motor carrier permits established in Section 212(a) of the Act cannot be bypassed under a guise of an interpretive action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.664" offset="5614007">Commission interpretation of the meaning of a permit, being simply a definitive declaration of what rights existed from the very beginning under the permit, cannot be equated with modification however, unless found to be clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.376" offset="5672835">And we say here, that the correction of an error in a certificate, to conform it to the findings required by law, is not an attempt to bypass the requirements of 212(a), anymore than the legitimate interpretation of a certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.382" offset="5740857">As this Court held in the Nelson case, is the bypassing or evasion of Section 212(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.715" offset="5774190">Now the second theme in the decision below, perhaps the major theme as Justice Harlan pointed out, was the finding of the majority below, that the Commission's action in modifying Frisco certificates, wasn't merely a correction of error, but an attempt to apply to Frisco's outstanding certificates an intervening change in commission policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.229" offset="5852244">Now we submit there is no basis in law or in fact by that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.271" offset="5872410">It's undisputed that neither the commission, nor any division of the commission ever modified or vacated the findings in the original reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.238" offset="5912325">It's undisputed that the commission did not, and as a matter of law may not delegate to its section of operating rights, any power to issue certificates, which do not conform to the Commission's findings as required by law, and it's settled by decisions of this Court, that neither a member, nor an employer of the Commission may modify the Commission's decisions or bind it contrary to law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1625.060" offset="6603630">The parties in numbers 15, the parties appellants at five independent motor carriers whose operations are competitive with those of the Frisco, the rail subsidiary here and it's parent railroad, two trade associations, one of them American Trucking Associations, which is simply the trade association of the motor carrier industry and the regular common carrier conference of American Trucking Associations which represents the special interests of independent motor carriers operating over regular routes in the transportation of general commodities, pursuant to certificates issued by the ICC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.253" offset="6736436">All of the parties in number 15 have participated in these proceedings, both before the commission and the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.019" offset="6771440">The questions as we see them are three-fold in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.803" offset="6786591">The first question is whether the commission has power, in any event, to allow a railroad or its affiliate to conduct unrestricted truck service through the purchase of a outstanding certificate under Section 5, I'll deal with that question if I may last.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.752" offset="6850330">The second question as we see it here is could the commission, under of the facts of this case, and even assuming that it has power under Section 5 to issue an unrestricted certificate, could have authorized such service by Frisco here, as Frisco alleged it did intentionally, even though in the only proceedings which were conducted in connection with the rights, which are involved in this case, the commission clearly indicated that the rail subsidiary was to acquire only a right to operate a so called auxiliary and supplemental service and to this day Frisco has never asked for reconsideration of that basic decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.912" offset="6990973">The third question here as we see it, is whether the Court below erred in holding that the certificates here in issue, weren't issued inadvertently by the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.643" offset="7025977">Now coming first to the finding of the Court below, and we must agree that they squarely held that the commission did intend to issue these certificates, of course we adopt the argument that counsel for the commission has made and I would just like to add a little to it if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.915" offset="7091075">First let me recap the situation very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.694" offset="7102151">Frisco filed applications before the commission to purchase the operating rights of independent motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.236" offset="7124302">A commission conducted hearings in these cases, and other independent motor carriers came in and protested to the commission in effect that these rights should not be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.688" offset="7170173">First -- the commission however did in its reports from the finance cases, allow the purchase by Frisco of these independent carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.863" offset="7198804">But it said that Frisco was not acquiring the right to continue to conduct operations, just as the independent carriers had conducted, but rather that Frisco was to get these rights to be used in auxiliary and supplemental service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.239" offset="7252302">Now Frisco never to this day, with all this time intervened, has asked the commission to reconsider those decisions in the original finance cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.757" offset="7286366">Now at that stage of the game the independent motor carriers were obviously satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.279" offset="7304443">The commission in the finance cases had met the mandate of Section 5(2)(b) and that Section is cited in our brief at Page 23 and it says in essence that the commission in order to authorize a railroad or subsidiary to purchase an independent motor carrier must in its order define that the operations purchased will be used to public advantage by the railroad, “In its operations” and I think it will be gilding really for me to talk much more about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.133" offset="7423875">This Court will understand that that is the basis for the commissions coming up with this term of auxiliary and supplemental service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.721" offset="7454281">And here is the situation that the independent motor carriers find themselves in or found themselves in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.780" offset="7474448">Without any further proceedings of any kind before the commission, they woke up one day to find Frisco operating up and down the road just as any independent motor carrier would operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.733" offset="7514258">They then filed a complaint with the commission and that is the Campbell Sixty-Six, complaint that has been referred to, to the effect of such operations were illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.865" offset="7546859">Now in the year following their complaint, the commission issued these unrestricted certificates to Frisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.995" offset="7579355">Now as we see it the decision of the court below of majority at least has two basic infirmities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.642" offset="7601925">First it completely failed to hold as it should have held that the independent motor carriers just like Frisco have some rather important chips in this game.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.040" offset="7639542">They were entitled to rely on the commission's findings and the underlying finance proceedings that Frisco was to get only restricted operating rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.740" offset="7674337">And second we believe that the court below failed to hold and improperly failed to hold that the congressional policy which embodied in the proviso of 5(2)(b) absolutely prohibits and here is where we depart with the commission, prohibits the commission from issuing unrestricted motor carrier authority to a railroad or its affiliate in any event and that therefore whether the commission did in fact issue these certificates inadvertently or otherwise, they were a novelty because they exceeded the commission's power.</text>

            <text syncTime="1993.547" offset="8077563">But let's say that the commission changed its mind after it had formerly issued its reports and orders in the finance cases holding that Frisco was to receive only restricted operating rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.820" offset="8122702">At some time between that time and a time that these so called compliance orders were issued, the commission had decided well we were wrong and we will give them unrestricted rights and we will evidence that by these compliance orders which we are now issuing, which is the essence of Frisco's claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.138" offset="8183933">We say that if the commission did that that it decried the motor carrier protestors in the underlying finance cases of even the rudiments of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.513" offset="8221445">We do not think this Court for a minute will hold -- would hold still for that argument, because what would the -- what would have been the result of that type of thing, carriers have gone before the commission, they have been satisfied that the commission has complied with the mandate of 5(2)(b), there is nothing more they can do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.976" offset="8295320">They know then and there that Frisco is not to get anything more than the so called auxiliary and supplemental settlements.</text>

            <text syncTime="2136.446" offset="8649122">Congress didn't say in effect that the commission shall not grant unrestricted rights unless some of the motor carriers have no objection to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2247.579" offset="9093726">The commission over the course of years has changed its mind for example as to what specific restrictions ought to imposed in any given case to carry out the original congressional policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.247" offset="9132387">For example when they first stated issuing certificates to railroad affiliates, they include a so called prior and subsequent rail haul, which meant that for the freight to move in the truck it had to either moved by the railroad or would have to be scheduled to move by rail after they are moved by the truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.918" offset="9191006">Then in the Parker case, the proceedings which became a proper case here, the commission substituted a so called key point restriction for a prior and subsequent haul.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.121" offset="9231862">But what I am saying is this that in every case in which the commission issues authority to a railroad or its affiliate pursuant to Section 5 that Congressional mandate is there and we frankly with all due respect don't believe that is for the commission to ignore in any given case, particularly in a case such as this where they have never been a claim before the commission, but they are an unusual circumstances which would require the commission to waive the mandate or the proviso even if it has the authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.247" offset="9344397">Now I think some of the questions here have suggested that there maybe some equities in this thing that Frisco might be in effect subject to inequitable results if this decision by the court below is set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.066" offset="9403643">In fact Frisco raised that point before the commission as long ago in 1946 and it's in the record here at 227.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.955" offset="9431228">We say that no validity whatsoever is denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.196" offset="9444185">Frisco by its admission knew when Campbell Sixty-Six filed its complaint before the commission and that was before it got its certificates, its right to conduct an unrestricted operation was challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.201" offset="9500191">In addition to the fact Frisco has defined it, received these certificates as a well staffed and well counseled railroad subsidiary, certainly knew that it had received property to which it wasn't entitled either equitably or (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.682" offset="9574066">And I believe it's fair to say that Frisco in effect had clearly simply decided to move this situation through, it simply sort of gambled and so far as I can see so far it has been a gamble which has returned a handsome profit to Frisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.288" offset="9628505">If any one has an equitable compliant here, it's the independent motor carriers who went all the way they could before the commission, found that their efforts was successful in having the commission enquire with the mandate of Frisco and then having cases of paper issued to Frisco which were contrary to the commission's findings in the underlying finance cases and having to sit back and watch Frisco over the years conduct its operation which has never been authorized by commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="3110.620" offset="12545860">Principally the Watson case was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.629" offset="12553906">Watson operated over approximately 85 routes, with respect to which, as far as about 65 of them, it had general commodities authority and authority to transport dangerous explosives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.137" offset="12599881">Watson filed an application with the commission trying to fill in all of its rights so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.504" offset="12617435">It said it wanted to handle dangerous explosives to the other 18 and 19 points as to which it didn't have authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.787" offset="12642513">During the course of the Watson proceeding, it developed that there were four government installations, very close to Watson's operating rights, which it hadn't asked for authority to serve, and Watson's counsel said right during the course of the proceedings we would also like authority to serve both.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.817" offset="12698624">Counsel for the protesters there, before the commission examiner said we have no objection to that broadening of the application so long as Watson is restricted to service of government organizations, the satisfactory (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.985" offset="12747316">Ultimately the examiner issued his report and the report became the order of the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.779" offset="12766438">(Inaudible) certificate was issued in the Watson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.540" offset="12777514">The certificate authorized the transportation of dangerous explosives as well as general commodities to these four government installations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.438" offset="12809174">But Watson operated under that certificate for four years and then without any notice or opportunity to be heard, such as has been afforded to Frisco in this case time and time again, the commission simply issued an order for purporting to revoke Watson's right to serve these four government installations, except with respect to the transportation of dangerous explosives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.904" offset="12887019">Now the three judge court in the face of that record, said that the commission couldn't do it, and Court affirmed, and of course it's pretty difficult to try to read this Court's mind and I won't try to do it except to explain what we think is the distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.038" offset="12939473">First Watson was an independent motor carrier, and there was no question in that case, that the (Inaudible) had no application to that Watson operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.898" offset="12975000">Watson was an entirely different category to start with, than is Frisco a real subsidiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.081" offset="12995688">Second, Watson had been given no opportunity to be heard with respect to this alleged inadvertent error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.084" offset="13019721">The commission simply issued an order, said your certificate is revoked here is a new one and third as it seems to be important, in the view of the fact that this Court sits only to review important federal question as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.258" offset="13068413">There was no objection of Watson serving these four government installations, in the transportation of both dangerous explosives and general commodities before the commission, all that the counsel for the production tried to assure himself up with this, that Watson wouldn't serve anybody but the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.922" offset="13127032">So I think this Court must have known when the matter came before it, before happening, that if it had gone along with the commission and upheld its correction of that certificate, Watson within 6 months would have been back at the commission, have failed an application to provide general commodity service to those four government installations, who bear in mind had no truck service whatsoever and would have been authorized by the commission to conduct such operation and so in addition to all the other questions, you were faced with the question of is this an important federal question.</text>

            <text syncTime="3371.838" offset="13590758">This system was gathered together largely through the acquisition of previously existing independent motor carriers in the latter part of 1938 and the early part of 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.793" offset="13646555">The four cases which give rise these appeals are only four of many acquisitions, which the appellee made during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.214" offset="13692217">You will note that they, I have them located on the map in the circle, altogether the six cases which were considered by the commission are designated in the record as 284 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.945" offset="13763166">Now I don't know the exact number of milage, my milage has been dropped when the two cases went to -- other cases went out of this case, but I think it would be safe to say that it is approximately 200 miles that is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.243" offset="13824293">Now you will note from their location, in these circles that their importance far exceeds their mileage because if we no longer have the right to conduct an unrestricted business from St. Louis through the red and green (Inaudible), Hamm and Cooper, we can't reach Oklahoma and Texas, and if we no longer have the right to operate the full through which -- which is shown in yellow in unrestricted service, we cannot reach Memphis from Kansas City and consequently we are left with the sparsely populated areas of Missouri, so that their importance far exceeds their size.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.969" offset="13999208">Now the red dots shown on here in the nature of key points are the key points which were included in the commission's order which the District Court has enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.802" offset="14042572">The major key point restriction that we -- under which we operate, outside of this particular order is that we may not handle traffic directly for the public on motor carrier rates between Memphis and St. Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.142" offset="14111953">In others words, if we -- if someone in Thomas, Mississippi sends this traffic to us destined for St. Louis, we may take it only as far as Memphis, and must then turn it over some other truck line to take it to St. Louis, we cannot handle it from Memphis to St. Louis, but that restriction was placed in another case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.721" offset="14186245">Now you note the dotted line down the river, that is the result of a purchase called the rider purchase where the commission specifically refused to authorize us to engage in unrestricted operations, and specifically said it must be auxiliary and supplemental.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.612" offset="14257821">So that's our restricted operation, the balance is unrestricted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.424" offset="14273076">Now it's listed in the appendix in our brief the citation of those cases, and I might note that in none of the other cases was this reservation, which is present in the four cases here involved, and three opinions really, was this reservation included in the commission's decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="3627.540" offset="14613504">Now the Interstate Commerce Commission noted in the Rock Island White purchase which gave rise to Rock Island decision, the commission said this, “As previously stated, from the date of the decision in the Barker case,” which was the Pennsylvania railroad subsidiary and which is referred to by you in the Rock Island and in the Texas and Pacific case, “to shortly before the enactment of the Transportation Act of 1940, the principles there recognized,” that's the Barker principle, “and applied, controlled the disposition of practically every rail-motor acquisition case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.018" offset="14767417">However, beginning with Frisco Transportation Company Purchase of Reddish,” which is 35 M.C.C. 132, “and continuing until quite recently,” this was March 4th 1946, “the practice of specifically reserving the right to later impose such restrictions as might be necessary to ensure that the future operations under the acquired authority should be limited to the rendition of service auxiliary to or supplemental of the train service was not followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.995" offset="14899388">With such departure from the former practice there also appears to have developed a tendency in rail-motor acquisition proceedings to treat the Barker case restrictions as geographical or territorial only in their intent rather than as substantive limitations upon the character of the service which might be rendered by a railroad or its affiliate under the acquired right.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3760.388" offset="15144939">Now the -- in each one of those, the correspondence between the appellee's assistant general manager and the commission is gathered together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.804" offset="15186631">Shortly after these finance proceedings came out, the appellee received a letter, which -- there is one for each one of these purchases, saying it's been approved, undertake the adoption of the tariff's of your predecessor, file you are adoption notices and your powers of attorney and other the other formal matters, we replied and did it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3817.144" offset="15371995">Now and so that -- the adoption was done then and there and the compliance orders are also included in those exhibits, they were the next step.</text>
            <text syncTime="3826.842" offset="15410761">Now there is one question about these compliance orders that I would like to clear up while I am on, while we are at that point in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.396" offset="15440959">This Court has had occasion to comment upon compliance orders, in the Crescent Express Line against the United States, which is cited in our brief, and has said, “The compliance order gave opportunity to the applicant or other parties in interest to protest its conclusions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3854.505" offset="15521416">And in the present Case, the actual fact was that the other people, others were the ones who brought the case up and they were the ones who brought the complaint about the compliance order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.562" offset="15577631">Now it's my understanding, I of course am not old enough to have dealt with these compliance orders, but it's my understanding that in a pure grandfather case, the man didn't go through a hearing procedure, he went in and filed a lot of a bills to show what he had been doing prior to the grandfather date and then he got his compliance order, that's it and that's when the objection came up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3894.714" offset="15682226">Now if his competitors thought that what he had applied for through his bills and what the commission had told him in the compliance order he could do was too great, too much authority then you got your hearing procedure or reexamination of his data or documents by the appeal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3915.013" offset="15763414">Now in these cases in each situation the man whom we were purchasing had gone through the initial phases of his grandfather, true but he had not yet received a compliance order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3933.156" offset="15836035">And then we purchased, now the appellants or the appellant trucking companies that appear here are not necessarily the people who appeared in opposition to those finance proceedings and I might add that it is impossible by any intimation that the people who did appear there were worried about us having an all out truck service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3963.015" offset="15955466">It's acknowledged in the committee's report that we did say that we were going to continue that business and in addition thereto engage in the handling of the substitute for the railroad, of the railroad freight.</text>

            <text syncTime="4122.604" offset="16593795">Now the only explanation that I can give Your Honor about this whole situation is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4129.424" offset="16621066">If you will note the four cases here involved are Division 5 cases before the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4137.460" offset="16653249">Our other cases are Division 4 cases before the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4142.310" offset="16672580">Now -- one thing that has constantly occurred to me is that the members of Division 5 thought that it was necessary as the satisfaction to the statute to include this proviso that the members of Division 4 did not so construe the statute and consequently when the certificates were issued, they were not, it was not a set policy to always fast forward that reservation into the certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4174.350" offset="16800789">Now if you will look at the certificate on Page 500 in the record I believe, 500 that is the first certificate which covered the Hamm and Cooper operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4192.151" offset="16871946">You will note the first thing on that page is a restriction upon the operations that were covered immediately prior to the Hamm certificate, they are on the previous page and they specifically mentioned that it was being -- it was a railroad operation or is a railroad type restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4212.954" offset="16955225">And yet the very next thing which is the Hamm purchase certificate did not include any restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4223.276" offset="16996498">Now there is one another item in these exhibits particularly with regard to Hamm and Cooper, which I think will be interest to Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4233.401" offset="17036936">It is a quotation from the Ozark common carrier application which appears at 32 MCC 459.</text>
            <text syncTime="4241.148" offset="17067969">Now Frisco Transportation Company, the appellee purchased Ozark or a part of Ozark, and after they had conducted the purchase and the commission had passed it for it, and before the final certificates and orders I think had been issued, there were two or three intermediate points for our ability and authority to serve was not clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="4268.703" offset="17178206">So the Ozark Common Carrier application was reopened for the purpose of considering it.</text>

            <text syncTime="4546.974" offset="18291231">You see then this case before the commission and in the order here is really a two step order.</text>
            <text syncTime="4554.219" offset="18320280">First of all on grounds that the certificates had been inadvertently issued, they revoked it and issued in there instead new or amended certificates.</text>

            <text syncTime="4574.287" offset="18400528">So it seems to me that the first step is all that we are really -- that I am really concerned with right at this point, and that is that there was not sufficient evidence on those two facts alone to find that inadvertence existed because with those two isolated facts certainly it is permissible to infer that the certificates were inadvertently issued, but it is equally permissible to infer that they were intentionally -- that the omission was intentional.</text>

            <text syncTime="5276.419" offset="21209004">While it does appear in the record I am advised that still the percentage is near that.</text>

            <text syncTime="5311.765" offset="21350484">I think that we'd probably gone down a little bit because of the -- such is the amount of freight tenders of the railroad which can't be used or handed over to the truck company has reduced through the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5324.457" offset="21401161">Now may I address myself to section 5(2)(b) of the Interstate Commerce Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="5331.892" offset="21430941">It's our position that the language of that proviso does not, in and of itself, prohibit the commission from issuing unrestricted certificates.</text>

            <text syncTime="5737.285" offset="23052518">I am not well enough acquainted with their recordkeeping.</text>
            <text syncTime="5739.471" offset="23061295">If they have that information I would be perfectly willing to have it submitted by letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5749.686" offset="23102151">But in connection with 5(2)(b) we also think that this reason would indicate that the commission must have the file in the proper regulation of the transportation system as a whole to issue to these unrestricted certificates upon the proper findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="5770.604" offset="23185742">The ones that are -- unfortunately the current cases where they are still doing had not been reported yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="5777.905" offset="23215000">And Mr. Beardsley who is appearing in those cases has maintained the same contention he makes here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="5784.145" offset="23239973">In all of those there appears to be a reluctance of the independent trucking industry to handle what's called peddle freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="5795.239" offset="23284276">And as a practical matter, the Frisco Transportation Company is handling some of that peddle freight for other truck lines if they don't want to handle.</text>
            <text syncTime="5804.084" offset="23319698">You got, you -- many little towns where they'll have no service if they don't know all-out common carrier service if they don't get it from the rail affiliated carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="5815.655" offset="23365987">In this case it connects with Diaz, Arkansas, they made an exception because we couldn't go out there only on substitute service, right, we just couldn't -- we had to find in the operation and so they allow us to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5830.242" offset="23424293">In our Rose certificate in the same case, they, after inquiring into the matter, they thought that it was best since we had as a result of the 206 application, authority to go on one direction, we could get purchase authority to go in the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="5846.352" offset="23488763">Now that one was that disconnected to our operation, but I think that on that question it's absolutely necessary that the have this discretion and I think this Court's opinion in Rock Island and in the Barker case both are cast entirely in permissive terms as far as the commission is concerned and both emphasize that the commission must have this discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5870.971" offset="23587297">Now as I said I think in answer to Mr. Justice Whitaker, I think they must make the findings no matter what kind of a case it is or what kind of an operation is proposed but I think that after having made those findings in the principal one or the last one is not what -- we want to unduly restrain competition; the other one is maybe able to use this trucking business, trucking operation in connection with or coordination with its railroad that after they have made those that it is perfectly proper for them under the statute to issue an unrestricted certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5907.588" offset="23733687">Now their position in the Rock Island case is that they must have some unusual circumstance and I think as a practical matter they have done that, but if you look at our Blake and our Reddish, in those purchases, they gave us the unrestricted rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5933.174" offset="23836087">So perhaps they didn't feel that way then, that was before Rock Island and it's in that period that they comment upon in Rock Island where they didn't, they were not as a practical matter including these reservations in the certificate and that's when these certificates were issued and I think that the legislative history also backed it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="5954.513" offset="23921455">This Court has commented upon it, and I think this is the only thing that you can find no matter how far you search in Commissioner Eastman's statement and then purpose of the proviso and that was discussed in the Rock Island case, and also in the Barker case it's in the foot note.</text>
            <text syncTime="5970.522" offset="23985507">And Your Honors also have examined the congressional record and when Senator Wheeler introduced the bill or brought the bill on before the Senate, there is nothing in his discussion that would indicate any intention of Congress to completely restrict the right of the commission to issue an unrestricted certificate and the same thing was represented (Inaudible) who handled the bill in the house, it's not there either.</text>
            <text syncTime="5996.783" offset="24090520">So most of what you find as you delve into the legislative history of the thing is negative proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="6001.778" offset="24110477">As a matter of fact Commissioner Eastman's statement was after the bill had been entered, it was in 1939 when they were considering amendments to the bill and if -- the bottom connection was the (Inaudible) amendment information.</text>
            <text syncTime="6016.268" offset="24168469">Now one point I think I might bring upon that, just after Commissioner Eastman testified, the General Counsel, the American Trucking Associations testified at those same hearings and that he commented -- in commenting on the (Inaudible) amendment he said that this thing is not strict enough for us, we think some language ought to be added, which would make it -- without question if they could not engage in this direct motor carrier business, and that he even suggested the words that would have to be added to the (Inaudible) amendment in order to accomplish that purpose and of course is suggesting in the (Inaudible) amendment both went out when Commissioner Eastman assured them that they were exercising a certain amount of restrain on these carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6062.443" offset="24353102">Now in connection with Section 212(a), and particularly the Watson case, it seems to us that it is beyond question that what the commission did here was to revoke certificates, that's the language of their opinion, their report, it's the language of their order, it's the language of their finding, and as a practical matter, when they changed the form of the operation authorized, they have revoked it.</text>

            <text syncTime="6130.741" offset="24626343">Now the commission said in their Smith Brothers case, which this Court has occasion to cite, and which is cited I think probably in all the briefs and in the opinion, that a certificate is the final act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6144.992" offset="24683290">They may issue order upon order, but when they've issued the certificates that's the final act and it compares to a final judgment and then the next thing that they said in the Smith Brothers case and it gives rise to this entire inadvertent (Inaudible) that they seem to have assumed in connection with certificates, they said this should not been taken as meaning that if -- that we cannot revoke the certificate issued as a result of fraud or mistake or one issues in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="6176.294" offset="24808573">Now, it's our view that -- and they say no such problem is involved here, so that what they said in the Smith Brothers case and the thing that has been used as a basis of all their inadvertent cases was open.</text>
            <text syncTime="6193.666" offset="24878059">And they should not have permitted that overt statement is control the result in subsequent cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="6203.394" offset="24916929">Now when they came to Watson they had a real pure case where they were claming they had made an error and so in that case also they said we do not have to be bound or to consider the 212 procedures and so they without notice and hearing revoked the certificate and the District Court condemned it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6229.326" offset="25020688">Now the revocation there was a reduction in the number of commodities that could be hauled to specific points, here is a complete change in service.</text>
            <text syncTime="6238.516" offset="25057468">So I think we come within the Watson principle as far as the fact that it is a reduction and I see no reason why in the statute, why there should be a different rule on revocation, applying to railroad affiliates than applied to independent truck liners, and that seems to be the basic distinguishing factor that all of the appellants point to and that is the fact that here you have real a rail affiliated carrier.</text>

            <text syncTime="6280.134" offset="25223920">That makes a difference, but the District Court, and the three judge court in the Watson case specifically said now -- now I think I've quoted it for Your Honors, actually it's a very short one, they said counsel for the commission argues that the order of August 25, 1953 merely corrects the clerical error in the certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6303.021" offset="25315453">Even if the Court were to assume, that the commission has authority to correct clerical errors without notice of hearing, the result in this case would not be different, because it is the holding of the Court, that the order of August 25th is more than the correction of a clerical error, and it is an attempt made contrary to Section 212 to revoke a certificate duly issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="6325.854" offset="25406777">Now I take that to the issued to mean one, that's within the commission's power because otherwise they could say well, we just do it inadvertently.</text>
            <text syncTime="6344.280" offset="25480443">So that I think the Court a consideration in the Watson case, took into consideration, this contention about notice and hearing and they removed that from the case and said it still can't be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="6357.233" offset="25532270">Now I think one of the reasons that, that may have been said was this Court's decision in (Inaudible) against State Freight Line, where the State of Illinois, as a part of their enforcement procedures, had a suspension provision in their statute, and this Court held that a state could not do that, because the power to revoke a motor carrier certificate authorizing and covering an interstate operation, can be revoked only by the interstate commerce commission and only upon the grounds of willful violation of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6394.363" offset="25680854">Now as a practical matter, in the -- now I did not find this quotation until after my brief was prepared, but when Senator Wheeler discussion Section 212 on the floor of Congress, he said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6411.989" offset="25751280">"Criticism was directed against the power of revocation, thus conferred upon the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="6417.416" offset="25773014">It was suggested that the effect is to put the future of countless operators wholly in the hands of the commission, which might act arbitrarily, and that the penalties elsewhere provided or ample to secured compliance."</text>
            <text syncTime="6430.951" offset="25827140">And then they go on to say, “however, that the state commission people who had testified indicated that the commission should have some power to revoke because that power was the most effective compliance provision that they could possibly have.</text>
            <text syncTime="6447.433" offset="25893073">That they -- you could fine people and you could do everything else, but if you could not revoke their certificates, you couldn't enforce the law properly, and that has been their experience in the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="6458.465" offset="25937272">Now I suggest that the indicia of what construction should be placed on Section 212, it seems to me that -- and you know this is American Trucking Association makes no contention about this inadvertent issue certificate, because I don't know how you could advice a client, that his certificate was good, if you always have to have hanging over your head, the possibility that there has been error.</text>
            <text syncTime="6488.212" offset="26056182">Now the commission says in our Campbell Sixty-Six case that we didn't have to go behind the certificate and it was no duty for us to go behind then and make sure that everything was just right when we got them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6499.243" offset="26100381">If they're fair up on their face and they fairly represent what was in the case, it seems to me that ends the applicant or the certificate of carrier's duly.</text>
            <text syncTime="6513.233" offset="26156283">Now for instance I can imagine that Campbell Sixty-Six, one of the appellants here handled the matter of contract performance, (Inaudible) substitute rtes we well.</text>
            <text syncTime="6524.418" offset="26201004">Well let's suppose in a -- in the case where they were replying for new authority, this fact that were going to handle substantive service for us came up, and that -- so a provision was put in their certificate, limiting them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6539.582" offset="26261713">This is service which is auxiliary to and supplemental to train services o this (Inaudible) San Franscisco Railway.</text>
            <text syncTime="6545.564" offset="26285641">Well now to remove that will certainly not be a revocation, and I don't think anybody would say that the commission couldn't do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="6726.323" offset="27008711">In other words they said that as far as being subject to penalties or criticism for having relied on unrestricted certificate that was wrong and the question of what limitation would be imposed was deferred to a later stage.</text>

            <text syncTime="6742.787" offset="27074539">Well and I think also the question of whether or not certificates were inadvertently issued, I can't recall the exact quote but I think they refer to that in their paragraph like there's a constant reference both in the report in this brief and in the brief of the appellant because this Division 5 opinion on Campbell case when actually the decision of the full commission was that we think that (Inaudible)</text>

            <text syncTime="6772.811" offset="27194598">Mr. Grinnell may I ask this is question suppose just for the sake of argument that the record clearly showed that this was an inadvertence, but it has just been left out by a copying clerk or someone else?</text>
            <text syncTime="6790.622" offset="27265860">Could the commission have acted as it acted in this case, in the procedure -- under the procedure which is due?</text>

            <text syncTime="6802.473" offset="27313298">Mr. Chief Justice my view of that is they held as all of the authority say that general power to correct clerical error, the fact that Section 212(a) Interstate Commerce Act severely limits their power to accomplish a revocation of a certificate expect on certain grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="6826.240" offset="27408384">Our position is that they could not correct that error in the certificate if it amounted to a revocation, and we think that is what the District Court has held and that's what the district -- three-judge court in the Watson case held.</text>
            <text syncTime="6841.068" offset="27467630">In another words, it seems to us that in the interest of confidence and certificates, Congress has limited the power of revocation and they limited it to the extent that it must -- the grounds for revocation must be a willful violation of the statute or a regulation thereon and consequently whenever the correction of a clerical error reaches the point that it constitutes a revocation, then it is prohibited.</text>

            <text syncTime="6900.494" offset="27705344">No I think they could correct the error and it would not amount to a revocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6907.079" offset="27731675">The example I have in mind is any carrier might have authority from Texas through Oklahoma to Springfield, Missouri and this could have happened in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6917.134" offset="27771904">We build our system from that and when we got the Ozark purchase and some and one or two other purchase, we went from Springfield to St. Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="6926.815" offset="27810670">Now had they put Springfield Illinois in there so that was disconnected part up here, it gave us no rights to packet with what we have already had to reach St. Louis, I think then that probably would not be a revocation.</text>
