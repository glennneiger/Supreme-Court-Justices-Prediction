            <text syncTime="36.583" offset="249710">Mr. Royall.</text>

          <turn speaker="kenneth_c_royall" startTime="36.673" stopTime="1565.447">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth C. Royall</label>
            <text syncTime="36.673" offset="250023">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.484" offset="269354">This case involves boxing.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.674" offset="286072">It's on appeal from the -- by defendants in the judgment -- judgment of the Southern District of New York in an action under Section 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.903" offset="343019">The District Court found an actual monopoly, not an intent to monopolize and a relief was based on this finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.848" offset="386800">Our firm represents the Madison Square Garden and New York I.B.C., International Boxing Club.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.392" offset="416893">Mr. Charles Sawyer's firm represents the Chicago Stadium, the I.B.C.of Illinois and Mrs.Arthur Wirtz and James Norris.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.526" offset="457435">I've been requested to present the case for all the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.145" offset="479901">Now, the three of the usual questions proposed in this case to the championship bouts that is distinguished from all the professional box constitute in themselves a relevant market.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.282" offset="548551">And second, if so, is there a violation shown of the antitrust law.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.464" offset="573210">Finally, if both market and violation should be established, is -- are there relief provisions proper or are they punitive, oppressive, and unnecessary?</text>
            <text syncTime="130.814" offset="626604">The period covered by the complaints from 1949 to 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.901" offset="650951">Prior to that time, boxing on a national scale had been largely dominated for some years by a tax record and later, from 1937 to 1948 or 1949 by Mike Jacobs who had a lease on the Madison Square Garden.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.390" offset="732975">In 1948 or 1949, Jacobs held had failed and the he was completely enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.683" offset="762128">A smaller boxing organization, the Tournament of Champions had started early in 1948, had declined almost to the vanishing point, was seeking to get out of business and salvage something.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.703" offset="830151">Joe Louis, who had held the center of the stage for a long time was quitting his heavyweight crown and trying to arrange a series of fights by others in order to obtain some revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.804" offset="882604">He was unable to find a backup.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.836" offset="894725">Professional world boxing was it, its lowest have for many years and was facing a further decline.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.492" offset="937357">Now, Madison Square Garden was worried about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.853" offset="950836">While boxing represented only 6% of the Garden business and involved just a smaller amount of its personnel, yet it did provide income normally necessary for the Garden to operate with profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.406" offset="1020949">The garden had a large investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.168" offset="1032025">Its expenses were in one sense, enormous and it was necessary for it to schedule and present popular events covering a great majority of the time it had opened.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.422" offset="1097017">They want it and badly needed the boxing events to continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.176" offset="1124080">Now, in 1949 and since 1937, Mrs.Wirtz and Norris held a substantial block of Madison Square Garden stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.849" offset="1170787">In fact, Norris' father has been a stockholder for many, many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.909" offset="1191058">The Chicago Stadium owned by Mrs.Wirtz and Norris had a problem similar to the Garden's problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.223" offset="1236302">It had been operated in a substantial loss and was desperately trying to increase its revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.234" offset="1272351">These two gentlemen also in the Detroit Arena and in an (Inaudible) St. Louis Arena.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.971" offset="1299205">Incidentally, before the decree in the case, the Detroit Arena had been sold and the boxing had been abandoned in the St.Louis Arena.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.683" offset="1338075">Wirtz and Norris had owned the Chicago Stadium since 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.881" offset="1358869">Wirtz's original activity was in ice shows and other events.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.226" offset="1384260">Both he and Norris had helped sustain the Stadium by such events.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.393" offset="1408920">And they had helped to build the Garden by various events.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.434" offset="1437132">For them boxing was an afterthought designed to -- at that particular period of the boxing history to get the Stadium into the -- on the block side a ledger and to help the Garden from losing to the margin that it had.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.153" offset="1516022">A settlement was made, an agreement was made with Joe Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.838" offset="1538696">The I.B.C. is to organize as promoting organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.784" offset="1562520">The surrender of Mike Jacobs' lease was purchased and the Tournament of Champions was acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.920" offset="1603062">The two I.B.C.'s promoted professional fights, championship and nonchampionship.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.156" offset="1628035">There was a Friday night series and then a Wednesday night series which I think it's -- everybody has pretty common knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.928" offset="1659068">As a result of this, there was a revival in the professional boxing in the Garden and in the United States as a whole and with other promoters.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.784" offset="1714552">But the Stadium continued to lose money.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.188" offset="1728136">Now, these aren't to show under the facts which led to the agreements that are under attack in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.636" offset="1761886">I want to mention that those agreements were made with layman, lawyers, and judges, were almost unanimously to the opinion that sports arrangements of this kind did not violate the law under the (Inaudible) case.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.617" offset="1853837">The contracts made with other arenas by the defendants were historically typical and nothing unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.392" offset="1888946">The same was true as the well-established return bout agreements and three year exclusive contracts with boxers.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.080" offset="1931682">Our position on this matter is more fully covered in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.300" offset="1952580">We say here briefly that the agreements were made by the defendants because necessary to say for declining industry which industry in turn was necessary to the continued operation of there to expansive buildings.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.884" offset="2038888">No conducts of the defendants caused the death for the Tournament of Champions.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.732" offset="2062294">They were seeking and unable to find anyone to salvage their operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.660" offset="2086013">The same is true of the St.Louis arrangement and the Jacob's contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.785" offset="2106493">Those people, Louis and Jacobs with the movements because they were at the end of their road.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.572" offset="2145677">There was no previous boxing competition between the Madison Square Garden on the one hand, Stadium on the other or between any of the various defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.901" offset="2207013">And hence there was no competition to lesson in this case because none existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.127" offset="2231881">The exclusive contacts with the boxers were for a reasonable period and they were necessary for the continuity required for the continuous operation of a Stadium or an arena.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.179" offset="2304084">These agreements in turn protected the boxers themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.556" offset="2325608">There is nothing in the record, not one single word to show that the defendants excluded from boxing any boxer, that they excluded a single promoter, or that any -- or excluded any other Stadium, or any television arrangement, or any radio or moving picture company.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.290" offset="2436577">The defendants did not own TV or other TV time.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.051" offset="2459564">At the date of the decree, they were negotiating, that is they did not own over a period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.864" offset="2486836">They were negotiating for a contract which covered a reasonable continuity on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.778" offset="2514526">There was no monopoly of championship boxing unless it can arise solely from percentages.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.405" offset="2552978">They did have a large percent of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.776" offset="2570428">Before the decree, the Garden and the Stadium were losing their position, have lost all their heavyweight bouts.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.484" offset="2613269">Nor was there any monopoly on television.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.234" offset="2628315">Indecently, the sponsors and the advertisers of television are much more powerful than either these corporations of any of these defendants could be.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.023" offset="2683486">As to the Stadium, the defendants at the time with the decree control only one of the several suitable stadium in New York and only two out of hundreds suitable stadiums in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.390" offset="2752972">And those two that they control so to speak belonged to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.216" offset="2776273">Under these conditions, there is not and could not be any possible control of price.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.310" offset="2820577">Now, that price element was lamely brought into this case in the brief in this Court and never found below.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.501" offset="2865403">The prices as a matter of fact, boxing must be reported to the respective boxing commissioners for their consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.803" offset="2914617">Defendants have not restricted or restrained the boxing industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.590" offset="2933739">On the contrary, the result of their action, they have expanded the number of good boxing contests with other promoters, have decreased the admission prices, have provided television for millions of viewers, and it helped the boxers financially, and helped the viewing public.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.820" offset="3026631">There is no semblance of monopoly in -- of professional boxing as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.031" offset="3063515">There are 2000 professional boxing programs in the United States each year involving almost 20,000 boxers because they have several bouts.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.451" offset="3125164">The championship -- the non -- the -- all the -- all the boxing contests promoted by all the defendants at the maximum between 80 and 90 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.406" offset="3196949">In the championship field, it is six to eight a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.959" offset="3231222">Now, there in our opinion, there is no violation even if the profitable market is a championship boxing market.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.312" offset="3276570">But they have sought the -- the Government has sought to post its case to make it stronger by picking out what we say as an artificial market that is confining it to championship boxing and not to all boxing.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.538" offset="3369566">We say that is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.221" offset="3384299">The District Court itself conceded that a violation was dependent on that market and that there would be no violation in any event if the market included professional boxing.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.101" offset="3467786">The only distinction between the two, we urge upon you, is a difference of quantity and not of kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.477" offset="3509269">Within any market, there are differences in cost, differences in price, and quality, and acceptance, and demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.368" offset="3564857">If these factors did not exist then there would be no competition possible in that market.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.721" offset="3606235">It takes those differences to make competition conversely.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.392" offset="3624939">If the existence of these differences define a market then conceivably each product in the market could be -- each product in the business could be a market because if every factor were identical on the theory -- on the theory proposed then there would be a monopoly in one product.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.720" offset="3734235">We say that the Court, the District Court cannot select and define its market just to create a situation where they can argue that there's a violation of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.631" offset="3797870">This would rather be a bootstrap operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.593" offset="3813752">And the cases they have said starting with Columbia Steel that it's first necessary to delimit the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.671" offset="3846040">It is true and the facts we think are immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.835" offset="3866728">It is true that on the average, championship bouts have a higher prestige in publicity, a greater public demand on the average, a larger number of viewers, they bring in more dollars on gate receipts or television.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.010" offset="3955440">But that's just the average.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.733" offset="3966307">Both championship and nonchampionship fights, either classification, they're maybe poor, they're maybe -- fail, or they're maybe good and there are differences in amount depending on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.441" offset="4025135">And there are some better championship fights that are larger in every way than some nonchampionship fights which often occurs based on the popularity of the participants in which outlays the rating, technical rating of championship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.956" offset="4119176">Now that's -- that situation is applicable to similar products of the same business of others in the same field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.031" offset="4163480">There is nothing for a -- in our case, there's nothing to show even one that there is a substantial audience for championship fights as distinguished from audience for nonchampionship fights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.996" offset="4235368">There maybe more a number.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.741" offset="4246340">But the natural presumption is and there is evidence in the record which states it, that is undenied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.588" offset="4285733">That all who view championship fights, all or maybe at one time or another viewers of nonchampionship fights, some nonchampionship fights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.875" offset="4330872">In other words, the audience may be more accumulated when it's a championship fight but it's the same people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.253" offset="4368384">Individual boxers start as novices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.634" offset="4385938">They go up the scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.391" offset="4392939">Some of them become champions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.605" offset="4401821">Some of the champions move downward and some of those that move downward move up again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.128" offset="4431914">And this testimony was given by witness which was not challenged or denied at all or contradicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.377" offset="4468903">He said, "This is a sport where boys are fighting for the championships."</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.881" offset="4490846">That starts with the novice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.703" offset="4502235">"We are showing them each week that we can show champions, why we want to do so."</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.265" offset="4536404">And that shows that the boxing -- professional boxing is all one market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.605" offset="4577782">Both of them timed with a weekly series, it is Wednesday and Friday night and some other promoters have other night series.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.772" offset="4618428">When there was a championship fight in the series, it's the main attraction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.550" offset="4637550">But when there is not a championship fight in the series then some nonchampionship fight is the main attraction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.130" offset="4675897">In either case, the prestige of the championship fight or the nonchampionship fight contributes to the success of the weekly series and makes its continuation possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.816" offset="4754683">The sponsored -- the sponsors who really should know (Inaudible) of about this matter, testified unanimously that all professional boxing as far as they was concerned was one market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.773" offset="4834513">We believe that the championship and nonchampionship fights are to a large degree inter changing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.467" offset="4869204">And under the Cellophane case, the market could not be split artificially into -- Cellophane as you gentlemen will remember cost two or three times more than the other products.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.913" offset="4931062">And the average -- dollar averages go higher.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.456" offset="4945168">But those facts did not justify a dollar division of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.969" offset="4979231">The Times-Picayune case was a different -- even different readers read the morning and the evening papers, yet this Court found that they could not split that market in the morning and afternoon that it was a relevant market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.457" offset="5077243">I suppose the General Motors du Pont case which confined the matter to paint products sold the motor companies was one of the most restrictive of the market decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.375" offset="5144848">But there, there was no narrowing on the market on the basis of quantity of dollars or relative figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.384" offset="5180897">As a matter of fact, the basis in -- by inference ignored that distinction and made it only on the different customers which does not arise in this case and from that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.678" offset="5242128">This case is clearly a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.241" offset="5256338">And it is rather amusing in a way that the plaintiff itself in writing his brief in this case could not refrain from disclosing the fact that in -- at least involuntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.101" offset="5327809">They thought it was a single market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.873" offset="5338885">In page five of their brief, the language is, "Professional boxing including championship boxing."</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.266" offset="5372426">And on 35, they said the championship fights are included within the classification of good fights which of course includes the great men in nonchampionship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.259" offset="5424358">Now, we respectfully submit that the professional boxing market is a criterion and was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.936" offset="5479111">If so, admittedly by the Court and by the counsel for the plaintiff in their briefs, this case would have to be dismissed because they did not make -- they could not make, they did not even contend, and there of course no finding that there's any monopoly of any kind in the professional boxing industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.459" offset="5605230">Now, the -- if it should happen and we of course being passed and do not see, it could happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.035" offset="5651519">That the questions of market and violation were both decided against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.939" offset="5679104">Then we contend that the relief ordered by the Court is a large part unnecessary and it's extremely excessive and oppressive, and punitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.948" offset="5759143">We say that the District Court despite its protestations to the contrary completely ignored the existing conditions, and I think of reading of their decree would almost disclose that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.445" offset="5829151">If those conditions included the fact that there were only two arenas out of a hundred involved and a hundreds involved in this case and that they had, that defendants had no leases on any others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.115" offset="5883800">It showed that at time the market was completely open to promoters and other arenas and outside of those of our clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.811" offset="5926640">As a matter of fact, the other promoters were successfully, so successfully, they took the heavyweight championship, and the -- they were operating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.073" offset="5979617">Despite of all this -- these existing facts and others, the District Court made an order that included both dissolution and divestiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.601" offset="6037817">Dissolution of the I.B.C.'s which were they're promoting agencies, subsidiaries of the Stadium.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.354" offset="6084838">And the judge did that after he had stated this, "I do not know of any decree at any time where a corporate defendant was ordered to dissolve."</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.633" offset="6145860">And he said that with reference to these same corporations which he later ordered dissolve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.179" offset="6180133">There is no contention that that dissolution of those companies would increase competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.826" offset="6202702">As a matter of fact, the Court specifically said, “At the time of his decree that such corporations when necessary to comply with the state boxing laws and were necessary in the operation of boxing in the Stadium.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.480" offset="6325269">That same situation arose by -- in the case tried by Judge Wyzanski, mentioned in our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2529.857" offset="10222843">It deprives the normal and recognized methods throughout the boxing industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.265" offset="10260459">If the District Court and if this Court sustains it and says the market is limited, is valid and limited to championship boxing, then certainly, they should not step into the other field and interfere seriously with the operation in the nonchampionship boxing field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.358" offset="10344782">We want to say this in conclusion that if you find a violation and if you find the market which we hope you won't do, that it would be sufficient for all purposes to prohibit exclusive contracts of boxers, to prohibit exclusive contracts with arenas, to establish a two-bout limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.679" offset="10462124">That would meet every possible legitimate purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.831" offset="10490650">This two-bout is a bad thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.256" offset="10500368">The Government didn't ask for a three-bout limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.654" offset="10513951">The judge put the two-bout on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.876" offset="10526908">And it would put them whether to decide a disadvantage because other arenas would have a great advantage at all bidding for championship boxers because they could bid for any and we'd be limited to two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.558" offset="10577586">And it would give them even as to the others an advantage, would remove the competition of us when they bid for the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.484" offset="10609351">But if that has to be born by us then we have to take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.190" offset="10648116">The -- I'm not going to discuss much the abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.142" offset="10671940">I think the Hartford -- the Gypsum case, there is sufficient law on that and it -- I understand still the law of this Court found in -- about five years ago, perhaps six years ago have said we have never treated the power of the trial court as one of discretion subject only to reversal for gross abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.236" offset="10776325">Rather, we have failed an obligation to intervene in this most significant phase of the case, that is the relief when we concluded that we entered appropriate provisions in the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.516" offset="10829406">I want to call attention again to the fact that the time of this conspiracy or alleged conspiracy that we deny that the defendants had no reason in the world.</text>

            <text syncTime="2700.330" offset="10904743">The trial court itself says that it did not charge the defendants with malicious, intentional or moral wrongdoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.944" offset="10951137">That's what the Court says and added that at the time of their acts, most people felt that the plaintiff's action was not prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.574" offset="11005680">On those facts, may it please the Court, there is no basis we think for the drastic remedy and that's the word the judge used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.818" offset="11042670">And simple justice and morals, the decree should be at most a curative decree with no element of punishment or oppression.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.971" offset="11091257">We do not believe that there is any violation of the law or if they should be, we think that the decree should be radically changed and reduced to the principles which I have sought and present to you.</text>

            <text syncTime="2770.369" offset="11184880">Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.118" offset="11207868">Before responding to the various specific contentions that had been advanced by General Royall, I should like to make a general observation as to what from the point of view of those of us on the Government side of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.880" offset="11294908">It appears to be the basic misconception, basic error that underlies and permeates the appellant's position on this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.039" offset="11355512">That error as we see it consist simply in this that the case is being presented to this Court precisely as if the case were still in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.733" offset="11422281">This Court did not sit to re-weigh the evidence, to retry the facts, to recast the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.978" offset="11467316">That's the function of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.962" offset="11475257">When the case was here at the 1954 term, it was remanded by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.872" offset="11510888">The Court holding that the complaint had -- had stated the cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.597" offset="11537742">The case should be remanded to the District Court to give the Government an opportunity to substantiate the allegation to the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.030" offset="11571493">The case went back to Judge Ryan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.172" offset="11588106">There were extensive pretrial proceedings, interrogatories, depositions, case retried over a period of two months, not only extensive oral testimonies in the record, but documentary exhibits, agreements, memoranda, contracts with stenographic transcript in this case covers about 4600 pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.022" offset="11699493">The printed record alone is three volumes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.295" offset="11708583">That was all before the District Court, after a trial of two months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.248" offset="11724361">Judge Ryan took the case under advisement.His findings of fact, conclusions of law, on the merits were delivered in -- on March 8, 1957 after he had had arguments on the law and the facts, proposed findings and conclusions by both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.477" offset="11797295">The arguments that Your Honors have heard today were the arguments that he considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.525" offset="11817462">The case has been presented as if he had not rejected those arguments, as if he had not found the fact contrary to the interpretation given to the evidence by the defendants, the appellants here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.163" offset="11875976">This proceeding is not in the nature of a petition for rehearing in the District Court or a motion for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.812" offset="11902621">And it seems to us that the appellants have failed to face up to the burden which rests upon an appellant in a case ofthis sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.215" offset="11948283">The burden arising out of fundamental principles of appellate review, the principle of findings of fact made by the District Court are to be accepted or not to be set aside here unless shown to be clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.027" offset="12015470">The rule codified in Rule 52 (a) of the Federal of the Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.249" offset="12032397">The rule which has been given special emphasis and application in respect to the big antitrust case involving such a case typically does and as this case does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.042" offset="12079522">The complex of economic facts clearly erroneous ruled this Court has said in the Gibson case means that the appellant has the burden of satisfying this Court after all is said and done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.977" offset="12147231">Leaving it with a clear and firm conviction, a definite firm conviction that a clear mistake has been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.696" offset="12178160">Now, the appellants have not contended that the -- the District Court here applied any erroneous standard of law as to the factual question, that contention which is usually made the basis of attack on finding the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.740" offset="12246288">That isn't here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.208" offset="12252244">Instead, the approach has been taken and it has been to take out a -- bits and pieces of evidence, the testimonies scattered throughout the record, and argument is to each one of these pieces.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.940" offset="12303130">In itself, it's a reasonable transaction actuated, proper, legitimate motives, no conspiracy, no combination, no evil in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.326" offset="12344717">Now, that's not the way in which the -- of an appellate court, this Court deals with findings of conspiracy particularly -- in antitrust cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.922" offset="12383065">There's a patent case in 226 U.S., the old Swift case in 196 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.295" offset="12400515">The Court specifically said that when it deals with findings of conspiracy, it won't fragmentize the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.088" offset="12427682">It won't take each little piece and look at it in itself because the whole maybe vastly different and greater than the sum of its parts, looking at the whole conspiracy, looking at all constituent elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.853" offset="12498735">You may discern or design the significance which is not apparent from each particular piece.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.881" offset="12522872">Now, not with standing that, the approach that's been taken here has been to present the case as if there were no findings of facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3540.833" offset="14266702">The principal -- the principal provision here that's under attack, the divestiture provision was substantially -- was proposed by the Government substantially modified by Judge Ryan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.723" offset="14326262">The provision as to compulsory leasing of the Stadium was proposed by neither side.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.507" offset="14353429">It was suggested to the parties by Judge Ryan after he had heard a testimony from the Chairman of New York State Athletic Commission, Mr. Julius Helfand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.931" offset="14395120">Mr. Helfand put in a plea for the independent promoters, the small men who are on the fringes of this business and who -- he -- he said -- he suggested to the judge that those independent small promoters who are now in the nonchampionship promotion should have an opportunity to go to the Garden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.655" offset="14481951">And he -- judge -- the judge thought that there ought to be some provision in the decree in the nature of compulsory leasing on a reasonable rental.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.694" offset="14518105">And the extraordinary thing about this aspect of the case is that after Judge Ryan has made this proposal in the Court, several days later, the defendants embraced that proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.438" offset="14569096">They incorporated in their own proposed judgment, didn't complained to him about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.425" offset="14593024">And that -- and the precise terms in which it appears in the final judgment, Your Honors will find duplicated in the proposed form of judgment which is in the records starting at page 621.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.139" offset="14643911">This is the defendant's adoption of a proposal initiating from the judge and not from the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.596" offset="14673795">The Government had proposed that the Garden and Norris and Wirtz to be permanently barred from the business of promoting championship contest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.657" offset="14709948">The judge said that seemed to him to be unnecessarily severe and he accepted on that aspect of the case the defendant's proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.786" offset="14750490">That provision is to limiting the defendant's to two championship contest a year, Your Honors will find in the proposed form of judgment submitted to the defendant -- by the defendants to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.423" offset="14793017">Now, I can't ask Your Honors to accept what I'm saying here without suggesting even -- even a casual scrutiny of the first page, the eary part of volume two to this record in which Judge Ryan deals with these questions of the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.794" offset="14894582">You have an unusual glimpse of the judicial mind and action here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.431" offset="14917047">He followed the practice of engaging in colloquies with counsel as he went along from day to day telling him -- telling them frankly what was on his mind, what his difficulties were, inviting them to address themselves to these problems that he had.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.632" offset="14989876">His initial reaction to the divestiture of provision was, it's too harsh, it's too drastic but as the evidence was presented, it was mainly the defendant's evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.507" offset="15033448">The longer he parted it, the more -- he reluctantly, he said over and over again to the -- didn't want to come out this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.797" offset="15074513">But he -- the longer I ponder over this, he said, the more convinced I am that the basic evil here is the combination between Norris and Wirtz, these mid-Western businessmen and in that Madison Square Garden Corporation in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.156" offset="15147969">He had to break that off that the only way in which he could prevent possible recurrences of the restraints, the monopolization which he had found was to breakup that monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3776.714" offset="15210245">Now let me say just a word about the -- his findings of fact as to -- as to the relationship between these two groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.483" offset="15249324">In 1949, when this conspiracy was -- was formed, the situation in the boxing industry was -- was roughly this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.736" offset="15294360">Madison Square Garden is a formal sports arena in the United States, if not the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.572" offset="15317661">It was the center of the boxing industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.414" offset="15329050">It was a place where most of the championship contests were held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3809.957" offset="15343156">At that time, it worked with Mike Jacobs in the 20th Century Sporting Club.</text>
            <text syncTime="3817.815" offset="15374608">He had an exclusive lease on the Garden for boxing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.617" offset="15385788">And they split with him on a 50-50 basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3825.956" offset="15407208">The only other significant promotional group at that time was the Tournament of Champions which was partly owned by the Columbia Broadcasting System.</text>
            <text syncTime="3835.742" offset="15446392">They had promoted two middleweight championship fights earlier that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3839.812" offset="15462588">They were planning to promote some additional ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="3843.553" offset="15477635">They have an exclusive lease on the Polo Grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.236" offset="15488293">Now, out in the Middle West, where Norris and Wirtz, two businessmen of very substantial interests, Norris was in the crane business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3858.399" offset="15536985">He was a stockbroker.</text>
            <text syncTime="3860.074" offset="15543672">Wirtz was a real estate man.</text>
            <text syncTime="3862.407" offset="15552972">As far -- at that time, their relationship with the Garden was -- was a rather insubstantial one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3871.538" offset="15589543">It's true they owned some shares of stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3873.814" offset="15598634">They owned between 50,000 out of a total of over 500 some odd thousand, less than 10%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3880.552" offset="15625592">The defendants themselves recognized that in 1949 before this conspiracy, Norris and Wirtz were not officers of the Garden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3889.254" offset="15660387">They were not directors of the Garden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3891.298" offset="15668537">They exercise no control over the Garden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3893.941" offset="15679091">They didn't even actively participate in the management of the Garden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3897.512" offset="15693406">They were out and lived in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.506" offset="15701347">They owned and controlled the Chicago Stadium, the Detroit Olympia and the St.Louis Arena which were the largest Stadium in those cities available for boxing but as a matter of fact, the boxing activities there were only occasional, not very profitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3919.237" offset="15780342">Now, the conspiracy here had its inception in an agreement which was made by Norris and Wirtz on the one hand, and Joe Louis, who was then heavyweight champion, in January of 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="3935.837" offset="15846693">Louis at that time was heavily in debt, namely to the Government for unpaid taxes and he was getting on in years and his lawyer, a man named Truman Gibson conceived of a scheme whereby Joe Louis could secure some income for himself without engaging in any further boxing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3960.058" offset="15943555">And then went to Norris and Wirtz and as a result of that, an agreement which -- substantive at which is in finding 107 on page 567 of the record was made between Louis on the one hand and Norris and Wirtz on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3976.233" offset="16008338">Now, under that agreement, Louis agreed that he would secure exclusive agreements with the -- then for a leading heavyweight contenders, Ezzard Charles, Walcott, Lesnevich and Savold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3994.437" offset="16081168">These four who were the potential successors to the crown would enter into agreements with Louis, giving him the exclusive right to promote their fights, with exclusive radio, television, and motion picture rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4011.123" offset="16147832">Louis would then resign or retire his Heavyweight Champion of the World.</text>
            <text syncTime="4016.873" offset="16170820">He would then assign to these four exclusive contracts which he had with these contenders to Norris and Wirtz.</text>
            <text syncTime="4025.949" offset="16207182">He would get a salary of $15,000 a year, some stock in the corporation to be formed by Norris and Wirtz, and $150,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="4036.431" offset="16249083">And that agreement was carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4040.631" offset="16265906">Louis got those contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4042.615" offset="16273847">He retired as champion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4044.052" offset="16279594">He had signed those contracts to Norris and Wirtz.</text>
            <text syncTime="4046.877" offset="16290879">Now, as a result of that agreement as the District Court specifically found on finding 116 on page 579, Norris and Wirtz in March 1949 were in the position to promote boxing context -- contest which the Heavyweight Championship Title would be at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="4063.147" offset="16355976">They had in effect cornered the market on hip on the heavyweight championship.</text>
            <text syncTime="4067.856" offset="16374784">And unlike the position they were in a year before when they were outside this industry, they were -- they had acquired a dominant commanding preclusion particularly because of the fact that Mike Jacobs was then in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="4082.777" offset="16434448">And as Mr. General Royall pointed out was mortally ill.</text>
            <text syncTime="4087.296" offset="16452524">Now, Norris -- the Norris-Wirtz group, after getting this agreement with Joe Louis, then proposed to the Madison Square Garden Corporation and to its president General Kilpatrick that they worked together and not create a -- create a top competitive situation that would be harmful to all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4111.671" offset="16550013">They are particularly worried about the impending competition from the Columbia Broadcasting System, the Tournament of Champions which was showing -- which had fast capital resources and was showing an interest in taking over the promotion of boxing in order to put it on television.</text>
            <text syncTime="4129.529" offset="16621484">Now, Norris and Wirtz and Kilpatrick, and the directors of the Garden, these were on opposite side, Norris and Wirtz were not on a Garden side of these negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4140.536" offset="16665475">They are representing themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="4142.510" offset="16673416">They negotiated and according to Finding 122 on page 580 on May 5th, 1949, they arrived in an agreement to combine and join forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="4154.964" offset="16723257">As a result of the agreement, common boards of directors consisting of Wirtz-Norris, Louis and Kilpatrick and Ned Irish, an official of the Garden were designated for these two corporations that had been set up by Norris and Wirtz, the I.B.C.s, International Boxing Club of New York, International Boxing Club of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="4174.254" offset="16800371">The terms of the agreement set out in Finding 125 on the same page, Wirtz and Norris would get 80% of the profits of I.B.C. Illinois, the Garden would get 80% of the profits of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="4186.080" offset="16847705">Joe Louis would get 20%.</text>
            <text syncTime="4188.196" offset="16856168">Championship contest would be allocated between the I.B.C., two-thirds to I.B.C in New York, one-third to I.B.C in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="4197.197" offset="16892113">Finding 126 as a prerequisite to the execution of this agreement, the Garden had to buy up it's -- the exclusive lease that had with Mike Jacobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4208.344" offset="16936730">Mike Jacobs also had an exclusive arrangement with Yankee Stadium.</text>
            <text syncTime="4212.384" offset="16952926">He also had an exclusive contract with the then welterweight champion Ray Robin -- Sugar Ray Robinson, one of boxing's all-time greats and an exceptional box office figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4228.239" offset="17016351">Now, that was -- that the Garden did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4231.094" offset="17027741">Mr. Jacobs was eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4232.880" offset="17034846">The Garden took over -- took over his rights to the Yankee Stadium and this exclusive contract with Robinson and with anyone else that they wanted to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="4243.179" offset="17076120">Then so far as the Tournament of Champions was concerned, the District Court found that pursuant to this agreement, the group bought up the right of Tournament of Champions to lease the Polo Grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4262.077" offset="17151666">They bought up all their assets including the exclusive contract which that group had with the then middleweight champion, Marcel Cerdan.</text>
            <text syncTime="4271.821" offset="17190640">Now, as a result of all these activities, you had this group in May of 1949 in control of the key stadia and arenas throughout the East.</text>
            <text syncTime="4289.781" offset="17262529">They had Madison Square Garden in New York at Yankee Stadium.</text>
            <text syncTime="4293.544" offset="17277576">They had the Polo Grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4294.740" offset="17282382">They had the St. Nicholas Arena which Mike Jacobs also had.</text>
            <text syncTime="4299.608" offset="17301817">They have the Chicago Stadium, Detroit Olympia and St.Louis Arena.</text>
            <text syncTime="4302.974" offset="17315297">They had all the key stadia as the District Court characterized them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4307.263" offset="17332433">They also had the heavyweight championship under control be -- by reason of their assignment from Joe Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4313.889" offset="17358973">They had the welterweight championship exclusive rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4317.632" offset="17373915">They also have the middleweight championship exclusive rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4320.674" offset="17386036">The testimony of Judge Norris which Judge Ryan -- the testimony of Mr. Norris which Judge Ryan incorporated in his findings was that that -- the I.B.C.'s had a regular practice of entering into so-called contingent exclusive contract with everyone who wanted a shot at the championship title.</text>
            <text syncTime="4339.572" offset="17461687">Any contender who wanted to fight with the title had to enter into a contract with them giving them exclusive rights to promote any contest in the event that he won.</text>
