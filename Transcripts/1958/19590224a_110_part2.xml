            <text syncTime="12.043" offset="151594">As I stated, Your Honor, the Boubaris case had reached the Circuit Court during the pendency of the appeal in this particular matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.491" offset="181373">And in that particular case, Judges Lumbard and Waterman reversed the lower court that had held and held at that particular time that the provision in Section 1440a relative to lawful entry and the physical presence in the United States for a period of a year before induction into the armed services must be consecutive.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.641" offset="297984">In other words, no breach could occur within the lawful entry and the physical presence of a year in the United States.</text>

            <label>Mr. William B. Mahoney</label>
            <text syncTime="59.152" offset="339989">And Judge Hincks dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.007" offset="347408">And then when, as I said, that case was decided while this one was coming up on appeal and when it came up on appeal, again Justices Lumbard and Waterman sat, but Justice Moore sat in place of Justice Hincks on the Tak Shan Fong case.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.409" offset="409057">And this, of course, Judge Murphy was unanimously reversed on the opinion or rather the decision in U.S. against Boubaris.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.447" offset="445210">Now, in order to come to some analyzation of this particular statute, it would seem to me as though with the Government conceding practically everything in the case, namely, that Fong was physically present in the United States for a period of year prior to his induction into the service of the United States, that he served in the United States Army for a period of two years, that he was honorably discharged, and that he had made a lawful entry into the United States in August of 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.546" offset="565582">We come right down to the one question that the Government seems to base everything on and that is that the lawful entry and the physical presence was not continuous.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.231" offset="624306">That's the only claim that they seem to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.166" offset="632038">And may I say to the Court here that the statute doesn't say that the lawful entry and the physical presence for a year must be consecutive.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.311" offset="672580">It -- it would seem to me as though that circuit court just wrote that particular provision into Section 1440a.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.445" offset="709151">Now, resort to the -- the legislative history of this particular situation reveals this that when it was before the House Committee, Congressman Graham on the Committee on the Judiciary was asked as to who was excluded under the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.586" offset="773726">And his statement was, and this is taken from the first session of the House of Representatives for the 83rd Congress, subversives are excluded, a conscientious objector who performs no military duties or refuses to wear the uniform are excluded or a person discharged from service under oath other than honorable conditions are excluded or pursuant to an application for discharge made by him on the ground that he is an alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.241" offset="888351">Now, that seemed to be the thinking of the members of the house as to who were excluded under this particular bill, although there was phraseology that its application was limited to those who were lawfully entered into the United States without designating any time element whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.408" offset="960972">However, when this bill was pending before the House, the Attorney General Rogers sent a letter to the House in which he tried to have incorporated the provisions of Section 1429 of 8 United States Code into the bill itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.308" offset="1032652">And it's under 1429, you'll recall, that the burden rests upon the applicant to show at the time that he applies for naturalization that he was lawfully admitted to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.849" offset="1078732">And the letters, just a short part of it, was to the effect since the bill would require the lawful admission of a person as a prerequisite to eligibility thereunder.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.953" offset="1123140">There would appear to be no reason why such a person should not be required to bear the burden of proving such lawful admission to the same extent as is required of petitioners for naturalization generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.640" offset="1177893">Now, that was definitely ignored by the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.994" offset="1203388">And in addition to it, it was definitely ignored by the Senate who had the same letter before it and that provision or anything bearing any comparability to it was enacted into the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.749" offset="1262320">And it would seem that in view of the fact that he -- the Attorney General tried to continue the burden upon an applicant to show that his lawful entry or rather that his entry into the United States was lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.075" offset="1319685">And when you find the House reacting to the suggestion of an Attorney General in this particular nature while lawful admission as an immigrant or a non-immigrant is held to be a prerequisite to naturalization, the Committee is of the opinion that the technicalities involved in connection with the continuance of such status at the time of entering the Armed Forces would place an unwarranted burden on servicemen and practically nullify the purpose of the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.094" offset="1451760">And as to the Senate itself, they merely stated that the proposal that the serviceman be required to have a lawful status at the time of entering the Armed Forces was not included in the bill, so much for whatever assistance that we might get from the legislative history behind this particular bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.966" offset="1547264">But I could point out to the Court at this particular time that if Congress were of the mind that the Government attempts at the present time to state what the thought of Congress was at the time, it would seem to me as though they could have legislated as they did relative to Section 392 (b) of the same Title 8 of the United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.820" offset="1654680">And you'll recall, this is found on page 9 of the petitioner's brief, that under those circumstances where they were endeavoring to confer citizenship on alien veterans relative to World War I, the Court will find that an alien in this particular Section 392 (b), an alien veteran is entitled at any time to naturalization upon the same terms and conditions except one that such alien shall be required to prove that immediately preceding the date of his petition, he has resided continuously within United States for at least two years in pursuance of a legal admission for permanent residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.056" offset="1843597">Now, I would point out to the Court that the word "immediately" in there is significant and "legal admission" is significant and if Congress were of the trend of thinking that the Government attempts to suggest at the present time, it would seem to me as though they could have readily enacted some specific provision in here showing that such was their intention, namely, that lawful entry and physical presence for a year had to be consecutive.</text>

            <text syncTime="495.263" offset="2084446">They put those people of permanent residence in one category.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.065" offset="2099597">And I think in this order that they had mind that any of those individuals who were in the United States and had been in lawfully at any time as long as they did what was necessary to be done under Section 1440a, namely, that they lent their services whether it was mental, moral, physical to the Armed Forces of the United States during the Korean conflict.We held this out to those people that there would be a reward attached to the services that they render.</text>

            <text syncTime="599.786" offset="2502510">I just don't go for and I can't conceive that a court would accept a solution of a situation of this kind where we hold out these rewards or anticipated rewards to aliens with some subtle variations to them that spring up after we've taken from the individual that which they were capable of giving under the Selective Service Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.218" offset="2616195">That just doesn't seem to savvy with the policy of the United States.And that's why I say that the time element would make no difference in this particular matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="725.946" offset="3007195">And the Court will recall that in Bell against the United States that that was a principle who has stated and also it was recently reiterated in the matter of Bonetti against Rogers in this particular Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.718" offset="3058291">But another factor that I think should be taken into consideration in this particular matter is this factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.004" offset="3095385">You will recall what I said that in September 1953, the exclusion section of the Immigration Department knew of the fact that this man was in the military service of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.358" offset="3148779">In January of 1954 with the order of deportation when they suspended the delivery bond, they knew that he was in the Armed Forces of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.840" offset="3198725">They continued to allow him to serve for 19 months after the verification of September 1953, they allowed him to serve 16 months after the deportation order was served and then they allowed him to continue in the United States from May of 1955 until December of 1955 when he filed his petition under Section 1448 of Title 8 of the United States Code.</text>

            <text syncTime="1352.098" offset="5511816">Now, this landing permit is given by the immigration authorities to bona fide seaman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.415" offset="5545044">It's part of the part -- it is considered part of the policy of the immigration law that -- that these people should be permitted to get ashore and stretch their legs if they are bona fide seaman and if you believe that they are going to get back on the vessel and sail when it sails.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.832" offset="5598751">Actually, they imposed quite a penalty on the ship when they don't return to it, so they try to get the -- the owners of the ship to help enforce the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1417.824" offset="5774712">Now, historically, Congress has, for a long time, given special privileges with respect to naturalization to aliens who have served in the -- in the Armed Forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.480" offset="5829256">And how much benefit they have given has differed from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.027" offset="5847437">During the civil war, they -- in -- I think in 1862, the first of these statutes was passed which cut down the period of required residence from five years to one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.746" offset="5902399">That was the only -- the benefit that was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.380" offset="5920893">They gave privileges for expediting naturalization in World War I and again in World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.375" offset="5952867">And there are several reasons, and I think it's important to -- to understand these reasons for giving this right which is largely a right to expedite naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.567" offset="5993618">One of the reasons is that, and this is particularly applicable when -- when soldiers are going overseas, that if a -- American member of the Armed Forces is captured overseas, it's particularly important that that man be a citizen of the United States so that he will be entitled to all of the -- the rights and the protections of being a citizen, so -- so to speak, of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.423" offset="6097063">A second reason that they expedite naturalization is in order to make available to the Armed Forces in -- as officers as well as anything else, people who would otherwise be aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.422" offset="6149099">You sometimes get a situation where you have, and we had it in World War II, where you have people who had military training and could be useful to the Government in -- in -- as officers, but in order to be an officer, one must be a citizen of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.237" offset="6216286">This is a second reason referred to by Congress for expediting naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.737" offset="6234363">And the third reason is, of course, to add another incentive to people being -- joining the Armed Force.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.903" offset="6282951">It's a -- it's an advantage which they get and it -- it aids in recruitment, it gives them a benefit for -- for service which they have performed for the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.463" offset="6329240">And that is the -- that is the background which Congress considered this Act in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.095" offset="6371767">They had tried to pass an act in 1952 but there was a difference between the House and the Senate as to the terms of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.393" offset="6404995">The House had wanted to grant the -- the privilege of naturalization to those who had come in temporarily and had joined the Armed Forces, while the Senate, largely on the -- on the pressure from Senator McCarran felt that the man would have had to have been admitted for permanent residence before he should be given the privilege of the expeditious naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.005" offset="6511365">Because of this difference, the legislation failed in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.403" offset="6532995">This was a serious thing because at this time, the conflict in Korea was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.210" offset="6556191">We had soldiers there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.460" offset="6561207">And in 1953, it became apparent that it was necessary for the two houses to get together and they did pass this bill, which we have before us and which is set forth at page 2 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.228" offset="6612302">And it does grant the right of expeditious naturalization not only to those who have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence but it also granted the right to those who had been lawfully admitted under any circumstances, provided they spent -- were physically present for one year at the time that they entered the Armed Forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.689" offset="6702164">This relaxed the existing immigration law which required one that there'd be admission for permanent residence and two that there'd be a five-year resident -- five-year residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.596" offset="6753782">In both of these respects, it was relaxed by this new law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.309" offset="6776560">Now, we believe that a reasonable construction of this statute means that there must be a relationship, that there was intended to be a relationship between the lawful admission and the physical presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.686" offset="6858167">We base this on two -- on three -- on three factors, one, the natural reading of the -- of the statute and the structure of -- of the entire Naturalization Act and two, on the legislative history and three, on the decision of this Court in the Bonetti case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.421" offset="6933086">If we look at the words of the statute alone, we find that there are stated in conjunction, the two conditions having been lawfully admitted to the United States and having been physically present within the United States for a single period of at least one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.542" offset="6997556">It seems to us that those two terms are reasonably read conjunctively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.628" offset="7025873">And this is particularly so when it appears that Congress could have had no -- there is no apparent purpose in giving any recognition to a lawful admission for temporary -- temporary admission only which has been passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.992" offset="7111346">At no place in the present immigration law, not so far as I have been able to find in any of the past immigration laws, is any status given because of the fact that a person has been lawfully admitted for temporary period and then left.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.774" offset="7182503">I mean if he leaves, he gives up whatever privileges he has.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.070" offset="7199640">And I find no place anywhere in the law where Congress has said that this gives him any advantage and indeed, there is no reason why it should.</text>
