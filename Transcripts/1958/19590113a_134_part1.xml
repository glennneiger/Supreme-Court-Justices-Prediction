            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 134, William C. Greene versus United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.176" offset="224110">Mr. Heller you may proceed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_h_heller" startTime="31.955" stopTime="186.643">
            <label>Mr. James H. Heller</label>
            <text syncTime="31.955" offset="231215">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.815" offset="246680">This is the first of four cases this week involving multiple punishment questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.921" offset="271026">It's one of two narcotics cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.545" offset="281579">It also involves a second question which was injected as we contend by the Court of Appeal's own opinion that kind of question commonly arises in cases such as this where there arose some multiple kind of punishment issues, but it's conceptually the same question.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.473" offset="357230">The facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.001" offset="363395">This case began in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on a 15-count indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.441" offset="389099">And I think probably the principal problem in stating the facts in this case is just to sort out the various counts in the indictment and get them arranged in my mind and in the court's mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.733" offset="430268">For that purpose both the Government and myself have in their briefs put charts about this indictment, ours is at Page 8 of our brief and the Government's is at Page 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.307" offset="476557">The Government's chart is a little more inclusive because it includes counts 1 through 3, which are not directly at issue before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.168" offset="516054">But I prefer my chart because I think it indicates in a rather graphic way what happened with the last 12 counts in this indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.264" offset="560462">The first count was a conspiracy count, and the second and third counts charged violations of one of the three narcotics laws involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.685" offset="606124">The second and third counts refer each to a single date.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.620" offset="625873">I should say by the way that all the events in this case except one last event occurred in January of 1955 about 4 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.029" offset="671535">Now the statutes which are involved in the case are precisely the statutes which we were before the court in Gore versus United States last year and they are also the statutes in the pattern of prosecution I should say is the same in the last 12 counts as it is in Gore except that here we have a new wrinkle, a wrinkle in which a single sale because it occurred in two installments is broken down into two basic transactions, three counts apiece.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.555" offset="801625">And therefore when we have two sales thus broken down into two deliveries apiece and each multiplied by three times we get the last 12 counts in the case, which are shown in the chart on Page 8 of my brief.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="186.643" stopTime="188.839">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="186.643" offset="849899">The sales was separate?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_h_heller" startTime="188.839" stopTime="419.266">
            <label>Mr. James H. Heller</label>
            <text syncTime="188.839" offset="858676">The sales are -- are clearly, if I may set aside the first two counts Your Honor they're only background material.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.933" offset="887097">The sales involved in the last two counts are two sales, one on the 21st of January extending through the 23rd and one on the 29th of January extending over midnight and to the 30th.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.503" offset="929416">Now, in each case if -- if the chart on Page 8 is looked at there was money given at the initial meeting or before the initial meeting to deliver some of the capsules but at that time Barbara Floyd who was indicated along with the petitioner but turned out to be a major government witness she was doing the actual delivering.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.648" offset="1006007">At each time she came to the disguised government agent and she said, “I don't them all will you meet me here or there later on and I'll deliver the rest of them to you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="234.891" offset="1042892">And that is the pattern by the way, the pattern in these sales and in the two earlier ones which aren't directly at issue is that a government agent named Fialkewicz approached Barbara Floyd the first two times he did it, so far as is known completely remotely from petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.955" offset="1107153">There isn't any indication that petitioner was directly involved in the sense of scienter and knowledge of what was going on between Floyd and the government agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.192" offset="1144142">He asked her, he said, he was an addict and he needed to get narcotics and he asked her if she could obtain them for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.566" offset="1169638">And she said on the 14th of January which is the first date she said meet me later tonight at a certain spot.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.778" offset="1202448">She took his money, she went away, she came back and she met him and she had the narcotics capsules.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.054" offset="1223555">She says that in the mean time she went to petitioner's house and got the -- gave him the money and got the capsules and returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.001" offset="1247378">And the second event is not even like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.746" offset="1262320">It -- it involved solely Barbara Floyd and Fialkewicz which they went directly from their meeting to her house, where she went inside and got the capsules in exchange for the money in her own bed room.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.171" offset="1304012">And she said these were capsules from Willam Greene that I had had.Her testimony on that score appears on, appears on Page 24 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.281" offset="1372453">Now, then coming to the last two transactions I would ask the Court to concentrate on counts four to six, that is, the first three counts in the first sale and counts 10 to 12, that is, the second three counts in the second sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.670" offset="1430026">I ask you to do that because those are the six counts which we tentatively agree, at least, the parties are the only ones before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.159" offset="1463986">I can explain why that's tentative a little later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.767" offset="1474435">But it involves the ambiguity of the Court of Appeals' opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.578" offset="1493661">In those cases there isn't any question but that the petitioner knew that Barbara Floyd was delivering narcotics to a third person.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.489" offset="1525321">He may not have known whether it was Fialkewicz or what the man was or there is no direct testimony as to what Barbara Floyd told him but it is clear why Barbara Floyd was doing this.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.087" offset="1571715">She said she thought he was an addict and she felt sorry for them having personally taken narcotics herself and she decided to get the drugs for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.075" offset="1607659">But she said she knew nowhere to get drugs, so she turned to petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.644" offset="1625945">Now, she was a friend of petitioner's and this is how petitioner becomes involved in this case so far as motivation is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.035" offset="1655515">But there isn't any doubt from the evidence that he was physically involved in the case because Barbara Floyd went to him, got the narcotics having given him the money, then came back and met Fialkewicz on each of these dates.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.474" offset="1709223">First time always said, “I don't have any.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.489" offset="1725315">I don't have any more right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.975" offset="1735241">Will you meet me later?”</text>
            <text syncTime="409.121" offset="1739839">In one case it took two days to get a hold of the remaining narcotics, and the other time it was slightly after midnight.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.561" offset="1765648">Now there is one rather inculpating remark in the evidence --</text>

            <text syncTime="435.940" offset="1847150">Now on the 21st there is a slight variation, the money was given to her in the morning and the delivery, first delivery occurred at night.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.104" offset="1875780">But the money was always in her hands by the time she had delivered the initial part of the narcotics and then she said I have to get more.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.983" offset="1915277">Now, there is one inculpating statement in the record and I don't, I don't think it would be candid to duck it.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.564" offset="1941608">Later on, February 2nd, Fialkewicz called the house where he had always contacted Barbara Floyd and he got instead the petitioner, it was the petitioner's house.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.283" offset="1984554">And he said, “Is Barbara Floyd there?”</text>
            <text syncTime="473.659" offset="1998033">And he, and petitioner said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.601" offset="2009736">Of course this is all testimony of Fialkewicz.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.700" offset="2022170">He said, “No, she's not there, but what is it?”</text>
            <text syncTime="485.036" offset="2043486">Now, maybe I think instead of trusting to my memory if I can find you the exact spot in the record it would be -- it would be a good deal safer.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.936" offset="2115166">These events I think are testified to at 90 and 91.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.306" offset="2140557">No, I'm sorry, they are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.871" offset="2162813">Excuse me, they're at 88 in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.451" offset="2189145">I think the testimony actually starts on 87 and he says, “This is Jimmy Lee,” this was pseudonym that he was using as incognito and they chatted for a while.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.016" offset="2231463">And he says, “I want to pick up 30,” around Page 88, “30 capsules or 30 dollars?”</text>
            <text syncTime="537.854" offset="2254764">Says petitioner, “30 capsules.”</text>
            <text syncTime="539.789" offset="2262497">“Well I take care of you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="541.761" offset="2270438">I said, “Is Barbara there?”</text>
            <text syncTime="543.103" offset="2275767">And he said, “No, she delivered for me.”</text>
            <text syncTime="545.867" offset="2286843">Now, I -- I've gone out of my way to emphasize that because it is probably the most disastrous direct statement of -- of petitioner's in the record and yet I think even that is open to ambiguity, when you consider that everything the petitioner did in this case, so far as the government's own major case is concerned, is shown to derive from Barbara Floyd.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.589" offset="2369703">This I think sets the background for the question which we have here in the substantive aspect of this case which is in part the Gore question again and which is in part very like the Harris question which is in the case to be argued following mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.378" offset="2436890">That is, in part we have the question of whether three narcotics laws should be applied to a single sale simultaneously to cumulate judgments and punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.662" offset="2482030">And in part we also have the question of if Blockburger is still adhered to at the end of this case, how does it work?</text>
            <text syncTime="601.593" offset="2509720">What does the rule mean and how does it apply?</text>
            <text syncTime="604.196" offset="2520168">Particularly how is it applied in terms of evidence?</text>
            <text syncTime="607.624" offset="2533857">Before I come to that I think it's relevant to know in this case what the sentence was imposed by the trial judge, what he said at the sentencing and also what the Court of Appeals did.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.734" offset="2582340">The sentencing judge was Judge Holtzoff who was also the trial judge and his sentencing remarks appear at Page 125 and 126 of this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.693" offset="2626121">And he says, “This is a narcotic offense of an ‘exceedingly aggravated character,' because apparently this defendant has been dealing in narcotics in large quantities for a considerable period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.892" offset="2674918">Some of the counts involved quantities as large as 40 capsules.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.305" offset="2688606">There are 15 counts in this indictment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="648.757" offset="2698428">And then he proceeds to sentence him picking out three counts, counts two, four and seven for consecutive sentences and the other 12 to run concurrently with each other and with those three in a manner which I'm not entirely -- will be able to solve myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.603" offset="2761749">But that in substance was the sentence and the case was brought to the Court of Appeals and the majority in the Court of Appeals wrote a cryptic opinion which appears on Pages 131 and 132 in which it said, “The record supports at least five of the sentences that were to run concurrently with the three consecutive sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.753" offset="2846386">It, therefore, supports the aggregate sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.549" offset="2857566">We need not decide whether it supports the consecutive sentences themselves.”</text>
            <text syncTime="692.603" offset="2873762">That is the counts two, four and seven on which Judge Holtzoff imposed consecutive sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.958" offset="2903228">Now the majority's opinion is illuminated somewhat by the minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.782" offset="2922454">It -- it's again a merely a tentative agreement between us but I think the parties do have the common assumption that the majority assumed Judge Bazelon in his dissent might be right about the fact that some nine of these counts could not be sustained on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.987" offset="2991313">We don't know that.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.180" offset="2996120">If you just do numerology between these two opinions, you'll come out with a one count disparity.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.070" offset="3019630">But the truth of the matter is that they seem to have avoided the consecutive sentence counts, two of which Judge Bazelon very clearly knocked out and they held themselves to five concurrent sentence counts, which is all that he left standing when he was done with the trial court's judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.405" offset="3101027">He first said, relying on Blockburger that these second deliveries in the case of each of the two later sales were simply following the same impulse as the first deliveries and that only one sale was involved here and since sale was the crime, unquestionably, that was only three counts per -- per sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.095" offset="3195800">Now, it's only a fortuity that this involved the Blockburger case.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.721" offset="3210219">Still, Blockburger was an opinion in two parts and the first part of this opinion turned out to be lenient to the petitioner in this case, and the second part of the opinion turned out to be stringent to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.868" offset="3250866">The first part of Blockburger says that if you have two immediately consecutive transactions, but generated by a single impulse then that is only one crime and this is relied on Wharton's Criminal Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.692" offset="3310111">This is at 284 in the area of 302 and 300 of the Blockburger opinion and then at 303 to 305 we come to the nub of the question that was before the Court in Gore and that's the question I'd like to discuss first.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.881" offset="3378866">In Blockburger and I think it's an interesting thing that the Gore opinion never -- never [Laughs] really cited, never really quoted the Blockburger rule, but the Court -- the Court in Blockburger said the applicable rule is that --</text>

            <text syncTime="842.403" offset="3473011">The applicable rule is that where the same act of transaction violates two distinct statutory provisions, the test could be applied to determine whether there are two offences or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of an additional fact, which the other does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.440" offset="3541138">Now, it is a little odd I admit, to be here the following term having also argued a bit in the Gore case to urge this Court to reconsider Gore, Gore having been an urging to reconsider Blockburger.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.123" offset="3595891">I definitely think that the reasoning in Gore is not sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.657" offset="3609997">I think there are reasons why this case may present another opportunity to look at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.469" offset="3629223">In the first place this case involves the record and the evidence and if the Blockburger rule applies this case really exemplifies the technicalities, the almost minutiae which become the vital -- terminate -- determinators of crime and punishment and lots of punishment maybe in certain cases, under the Blockburger rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.107" offset="3719816">In the second case while it's more of an emotional factor I think the indictment in this case indicates the abuses to which the Blockburger mentality can be carried and I might say that had the Government not said at the -- the beginning of the trial in this case that they were relying on the concept of sale as opposed to delivery or distribution or giving away, which these narcotics laws allow to, to be punished, we might have 12 counts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.874" offset="3826918">We might have 12 counts because they might have chosen a different unit of prosecution and it's one that the statute provides for.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.727" offset="3866311">And as I read Gore, one of the basic things that it says and perhaps the basic thing is that where Congress has written these three statutes, has imposed three different requirements for the sale of narcotics, has said these are different times in history and has made no effort to refer to the way in which they should used together.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.476" offset="3953246">This Court will presume that each does state a separate crime even though for suit in one transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.120" offset="3983862">If I -- if I read Gore correctly in saying that I must say I think there are a number of instances, some of them which may be imagined and some of them which are actual, which certainly limit that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.692" offset="4042167">I might say at the beginning then I -- I can't say personally.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.467" offset="4057213">I say can't personally how the failure of Congress to consider the interrelationship of narcotics statutes which it was never informed were being applied simultaneously can be taken to mean that it assumed that they could be applied cumulatively.</text>

            <text syncTime="1335.082" offset="5443688">That in one instance Congress had passed an import law, but it didn't believe that, that got a domestic traffic of drugs that are already slipped in Then it passed the Harrison Act and really in passing the Harrison Act it was most concerned with doctors, because the one section of the Harrison Act that went at general people was the one that the case of Jin Fuey Moy knocked out and then in 1919 in response to that decision the Court passed the third law and probably the third law does in its wake aim most directly at the ordinary trafficker.</text>
