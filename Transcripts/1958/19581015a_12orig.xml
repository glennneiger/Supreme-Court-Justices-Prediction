            <label>Mr. Wallace Howland</label>
            <text syncTime="36.200" offset="248142">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.472" offset="257233">I speak on behalf of the motion made by the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.831" offset="274683">California, as leave of the Court, with permission to file a complaint in the original jurisdiction of this Court, the defendant is in the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.381" offset="312926">The two States are the only parties to the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.034" offset="327555">The case involves trade barriers between those two States.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.904" offset="343019">Washington has discriminated and thus discriminate against interstate commerce in wine.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.642" offset="365902">In so doing, Washington denies the citizens of other States, trade privileges, in the sale and distribution of wine, which it freely accords to its own citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.272" offset="408430">It does so in order to protect its own wine industry against the competition of out-of-state and foreign wines.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.861" offset="438836">And for this, we submit, there is no sanction in the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.109" offset="459839">Violated by these statutes, another official acts of the State of Washington, are the constitutional rights of the State of California itself, as a State, in addition to the constitutional rights of its citizens and industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.089" offset="523682">The purpose of this action is to enjoin official acts of the State of Washington which, we submit, violate the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.403" offset="557014">Supporting the position taken by California in this case, the State of New York has filed a brief, amicus curiae.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.979" offset="591287">This was (Inaudible) from a significant source, because second only to the State of California, the State of New York is the next largest wine-producing state in the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.970" offset="635277">Washington opposes the filing of this complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.080" offset="647711">The principle argument is that California has no standing to sue, that it is not a proper plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.248" offset="672371">And that in filing -- this seeking to file its complaint, the California is acting only as a nominal plaintiff on behalf of its wine industry and the members of its wine industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.436" offset="717093">Issue has been joined on this point in the briefs which have been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.959" offset="735169">And with the Court's permission, my main effort, in this oral argument, will be addressed to the proposition that -- that California thus have standing to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.617" offset="773831">Indeed, I shall show that California is the only plaintiff legally capable of bringing this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.903" offset="799013">And the reason is that the complaint amongst other things, alleges an injury to the State as -- that is to say to the executive branch of the State Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.359" offset="844779">The complaint in this case discloses two aspects to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.834" offset="866722">On the one hand, it is a case of the type which is some -- has previously been before the Court, where a State sues his plaintiff in the role of parens patriae to assert its -- to assert an injury to its quasi-sovereign rights and where it is suing on cause of -- causes of action, which it derives from its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.089" offset="947702">That is one aspect of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.125" offset="955852">But also very much in the case and which bears directly upon this question of California standing to sue is the fact that California alleges its own cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.541" offset="997543">California has searched that it, as a State, independently of its citizens, has been denied constitutional rights which it enjoys.</text>

            <text syncTime="887.685" offset="3654092">Washington wine Industry is trying to isolate California wine from the lawful Washington market where different brands of Washington wine are competing on a private industry competitive business basis for the trade -- the trade and custom of Washington consumers.</text>

            <text syncTime="932.704" offset="3834232">And the wineries -- that the Washington wineries have a free choice in selecting which of these wholesalers they want to distribute their respective brands and trade names of -- of wine.</text>

            <text syncTime="958.057" offset="3935587">They employ wine salesman who go out on regular routes and contact the retail trade and actively solicit the purchase of their Washington wine and promote it -- promote its sale in other ways which I will also mention.</text>

            <text syncTime="1009.565" offset="4141641">These 4800 retailers are solicited by salesmen representing every brand of Washington wine that is produced to please buy of these brands of Washington wine and can I take your order this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.766" offset="4198484">Note that there is no restriction on the wine which the 4800 retail licensees are authorized to sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.464" offset="4229204">The retail licensee who is the man dealing with the consuming public, can sell California wine, Washington wine, New York wine, or foreign wine one, without any restriction based upon its source placed upon him or by the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.829" offset="4290644">And that's why I say that the discriminations which we complain are all discriminations that bear on the wholesale distribution, because after the wine has reached the point of the retailer, then so far as the retailer is concerned, the State of Washington exercises no further control upon him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.637" offset="4381968">The second type of discrimination involved in this case is the discriminatory of policies and laws of the State of Washington concerning the place of wine.</text>

            <text syncTime="1504.901" offset="6122977">It has certain official functions which its law requires that if it discharge and there is no other plaintiff that is capable of getting relief to the State of California for the injury to -- for the -- for the frustration of its public policies for the restraints and the restrictions put upon its employees and officials in the pursuit of their -- of their duties.</text>

            <text syncTime="1542.921" offset="6275009">But this is not securing redress to the legal injuries which the State of California itself had suffered and which gives rise to a controversy between two States of the very type that the original jurisdiction of this Court was created to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.457" offset="6357243">The -- I've mentioned that the authority of the Washington State Liquor Control Board gives a complete discretion over the prices of California wine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.811" offset="6410637">And the Board has only one price and that is a retail price per bottle at which they sell to all commerce, be they retailers purchasing for resale, hotels, taverns or whether it'd be the individual consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.273" offset="6476466">There is no trade discount on wine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.076" offset="6487646">And I think it fairly significant that although Washington law prohibits the trade discount on wine, Washington law requires that the Board give not less than 15% trade discount on distilled spirits to what are known as Class H licensees, which are hotels, restaurants and other bars of that type, who sell mixed drinks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.060" offset="6623587">But where -- where they -- they are mandated by the statute to give a 15% discount to a hotel who owns a bottle of whiskey to use for serving mixed drinks, the law forbid -- forbids the State Liquor Board to give any trade discount on a bottle of wine to a hotel that wants to sell and has the authority to sell a wine by the Director.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.165" offset="6716061">The price levels which the Liquor Board has set before -- for California and other out-of-state wines over a long period of time have been, according to the allegations of the complaint, arbitrary and unreasonably high.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.437" offset="6785128">The Board has purchased California wine at prices which is -- have resulted in a markup of over 100% at the -- taking into account of this -- the -- the price at which it was then put on the shelves of the retail stores for sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.112" offset="6859839">The board price is FOB state liquor store.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.736" offset="6874363">There is no delivery service for California wine from the state store.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.764" offset="6898395">The Washington retailers who want California wine must not only pay cartage from the state liquor store, but he has to go to the added inconvenience of arranging for cartage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.391" offset="6940923">Whereas, as I've already said in connection with Washington wine, the -- the Washington law requires that the Washington winery specify a delivered price -- a price delivered at the retailer's establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.075" offset="6999646">The net effects of these pricing policies are simply this, that there are two retail markups, not one, but two retail markups on California wine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.905" offset="7043009">First is the -- the markup of anywhere from 68% to 100% which State Liquor Board puts on the wine as it goes through its store.</text>
