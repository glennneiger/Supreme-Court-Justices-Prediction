            <text syncTime="59.278" offset="340511">These cases involved the right of coal operators engaged in the business of strip mining coal to present its depletion under the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.745" offset="382307">This is not only the first case involving strip miners to come before the Court, but to our knowledge, it is the first case ever to come before this Court in which the right of the person actually producing the minerals to depletion was ever challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.970" offset="463287">The facts in both cases are essentially the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.416" offset="477080">I will state the facts in the Parsons case and due to the extent there are differences, Mr. Berger will state them in the Huss case.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.965" offset="515218">Perhaps it would be helpful to consider briefly the operation known as "strip mining."</text>
            <text syncTime="109.169" offset="540087">A strip miner mines from the surface of the earth.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.809" offset="554611">Unlike a deep miner, he does not drive shafts into the earth to reach the coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.505" offset="581360">Basically, the operation is performed by removing the earth which lies over the coal known as "overburden."</text>
            <text syncTime="128.467" offset="617200">This overburden is removed by making massive cuts in the earth.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.115" offset="643845">The overburden from one cut being deposited into the adjacent cut from which the coal has already been removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.046" offset="679581">The operation resembles to a degree plowing a field except that the furrows may be as much as 200 feet deep.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.595" offset="713749">Strip mining of course, is feasible only where the coal does not lie at too great a depth beneath the surface, and also the thickness of the seam of coal has a bearing because it is profitable to remove more overburden to reach a thick seam than a thin one.Seams of coal do not lie or run at a uniform depth beneath the surface.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.960" offset="811238">They may crop, fault or pitch.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.055" offset="823568">Coal crops when it comes to the surface of the earth.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.483" offset="837256">It faults where the vein is cut off beneath the surface usually by a rock upheaval, and it pitches where it goes into the earth at a sharper incline.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.452" offset="893158">The overburden is removed in several ways, by scrapers which are the ordinary road scrapers with which one is generally familiar by high-lift shovels which are basically the standard form of steam shovel with a little longer boom to enable the bucket of the shovel to be raised to a greater height.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.061" offset="979571">In other words the high-lift shovel in effect digs itself down into a hole in order to reach the coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.992" offset="1011336">And lastly, coal is removed -- overburden is removed by the use of draglines.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.634" offset="1033906">These vary in size but basically, they're all the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.956" offset="1051146">They operate on the same principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.252" offset="1060342">They consist of a machinery housing and a long boom perhaps 60 to 135 feet from which is suspended a huge bucket by a cable.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.512" offset="1105377">This bucket is capable of removing great quantities of earth at one scoop.</text>

            <text syncTime="269.304" offset="1180609">Well, I think a fair answer to that, sir, would be that bulldozers, scrapers, trucks may generally be used in -- in road building and in other instances where it is necessary to remove quantities of earth.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.958" offset="1251244">A dragline is generally limited to a stripping operation, although where it would be necessary to remove great quantities of earth in a road building operation, I presume that a dragline would be used for the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.491" offset="1317386">Draglines are customarily used in coal stripping because of the fact that they do remove great quantities of earth with one scoop or bite, and also because they can work at practically any depth because of the fact that their limitation really is only the extent of the cable --</text>

            <text syncTime="356.485" offset="1529292">Once the overburden has been removed exposing the coal, the coal is cleaned, loosened and placed usually by dynamiting so that it may be removed from the vein.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.133" offset="1575894">This removal is accomplished by placing a loading shovel, which is generally a steam shovel on the coal in place bringing trucks down into the cut and loading the trucks with the steam -- with the steam shovel.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.809" offset="1634617">It's obvious of course, that roads must be built for this operation not only to enable the strip miner to move his heavy-duty equipment in but also to enable the coal to be hauled out in trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.165" offset="1691982">In the Parsons case, the partnership Parsons mined the coal under an oral contract with Rockhill Coal Company, the owner of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.386" offset="1740884">This contract, is what is known in the industry as a salvage contract, that is to say, Parsons bore all the expenses of the operation and furnished the equipment and received payment only if it was successful in discovering and extracting marketable coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.657" offset="1817997">Parsons was paid a stated price per ton by the coal company on whose lands they were operating.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.332" offset="1848717">The contract was terminable on 10 days notice by either party, but if the contract was terminated, Parsons had the absolute right to remove and be paid for all coal which he had uncovered even though that took more than 10 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.130" offset="1927920">Parsons had the exclusive right strip areas allocated to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.394" offset="1948923">Parsons controlled the amount of equipment, the number of workers used in the job, and the quantity of coal to be stripped.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.514" offset="1981419">The value of the equipment used on the job by Parsons ranged from $60,000 in the four-part of the operation to as high as $250,000 in the latter part of the operation.In fact, Parsons' agreement was never terminated by the landowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.080" offset="2055711">Parsons stripped on the landowner's land continuously for over eight years.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.909" offset="2082983">The stripping ended when Parsons gave the landowner notice that it intended to cease operations after 30 days if that was satisfactory.</text>

            <text syncTime="527.021" offset="2211506">The petitioners brought suit upon rejected claims for refund of federal income tax for the years 1945 through 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.732" offset="2254346">The District Court and the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit concluded that they were not entitled to depletion and it is this conclusion which is before this Court for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.126" offset="2303875">At the outset, I think it is important to note that the petitioners here seek only a share of the depletion, not all of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.209" offset="2348178">This is so because the statute provides for a deduction of a -- for depletion in the form of a flat percentage of gross income from the property which is defined as the gross income from mining.</text>

            <text syncTime="940.398" offset="3864952">Now, of course whether the strip miner is entitled to this share of depletion we seek depends upon whether he has under the decisions of this Court an economic interest in the coal in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.611" offset="3933811">First, we should observe that economic interest does not mean legal title to or ownership of the coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.089" offset="3963695">Indeed, the term "economic interest" includes, as this Court has held in Palmer against Bender, every case in which the taxpayer is acquired by investment, any interest in the mineral in place and secures by any form of legal relationship income derived from the extraction of the mineral to which he must look for a return of his capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.492" offset="4061288">This principle was most recently restated by this Court in the Commissioner versus Southwest Exploration Company.</text>

            <text syncTime="1006.161" offset="4128057">As required by a state law in the absence of an artificial -- a natural or artificial drilling island from which he could drill, he secured the right from the adjacent upland owners to erect drilling equipment on their lands and by the process known as "whipstock drilling" reach the offshore oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.588" offset="4209768">He agreed to pay the upland owners a stated percentage of his net profits for the right to use their land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.214" offset="4240280">The issue before this Court was whether the upland owners had an economic interest in the offshore oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.983" offset="4271313">This Court held that they did, that the upland owners' contribution, their land, was an investment in the oil in place sufficient to establish their economic interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1141.361" offset="4668792">First, by the contracts, we acquired an interest in the coal namely, the right to mine it, and be paid for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1423.951" offset="5799163">We believe that perhaps an apt way of demonstrating our position that the strip miners in this case had an economic interest in the coal in place is to paraphrase the words of this Court in the Southwest case and substitute the word "strip miners" for the word "upland owners" as used in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.075" offset="5891636">Here, the strip miners chose to contribute their organization and equipment to the coal-stripping venture in return for income based upon production.</text>
