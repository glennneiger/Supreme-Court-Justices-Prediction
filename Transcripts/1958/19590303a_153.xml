            <text syncTime="22.110" offset="191822">I left off yesterday on the question of local improvements, while the legislature of a State, as in this case, enacted a statute and set forth exactly what assessments could be made and how the -- how the notice would be given and set forth very strict limitations as to these assessments.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.286" offset="352528">Now, this Court has passed on that very question in the case of Browning versus Hooper, 269 U.S. 396.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.161" offset="395995">That court -- the Court held in that case where a local improvement territory is selected and the burden is spread by the legislature or by a municipality to which the State has granted full legislative powers over the subject, the owners of the property in the district have no constitutional right to be heard on the question of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.064" offset="499649">Now, in the case that I cited to you, the Supreme Court did hold that statute unconstitutional because they held the district in that case was not created by the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.513" offset="553462">The taxing district there had been not been created by the legislature, but the next case on it is the case of Memphis &amp; C.R. Company versus Pace.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.411" offset="597034">In this case, the state statute creating road districts and permitting the levy of taxes against property therein was attacked under the Due Process Cause of the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.146" offset="647920">And in all of these cases, the proper attack was made and it was made on that point which, of course, is not the case here.</text>

            <text syncTime="198.559" offset="897651">This Court held that the district was created by the legislature, that this was a question in law -- of law and that the decision of the State on this question was controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.542" offset="941537">This Court held therein that property owners in districts created under the authority of the legislature and being legislatively created districts were not entitled to notice and hearing as to the benefits conferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.977" offset="1003290">They held and went on and said that it's a matter that rest in the discretion of the State and are not controlled by either the Due Process or the equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the validity of that statute was upheld by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.977" offset="1067238">And I say to you in this Court, if you had the proper attack in this case, which you don't, and I'll mention that again in a second.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.701" offset="1098167">If he had properly attacked, he wouldn't -- he wouldn't, under the rulings of this Court, be entitled to any relief because our statute in Florida goes further than your requirements because this very statute could have provided for no notice whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.778" offset="1174444">Now, counsel, in his brief, my opponent, he tries to cite some state cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1242.983" offset="5075257">We then have said, “Appellants respectfully submit that to permit the suggestion of a constitutional question objection not raised in the Trial Court nor included in the main briefs before this Court is contrary to the long lines of decisions enunciated by this Court.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2041.743" offset="8270346">It wouldn't make any difference if the City of Miami had given the property owners a notice in writing every day that they were going to levy the assessments and that had it served that notice upon them personally.</text>

            <text syncTime="2820.748" offset="11386337">But of course, and the reason we mention this among other things in our argument is that in one of the opinions of this Court, I think, in the Malaney case, I think it was that Justice Black in that opinion referred to a matter being tucked away upon an obscure page in the newspaper, a notice not directed to anybody in particular and which was not likely to come to the attention even of a person's friends.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.638" offset="11485915">And he says that the purpose of notice was to get information to a person, and of course, it follows, and I am not quoting his opinion there, of course it follows that the more inconspicuous the place is, if the notice is published, the least likely it is that it shall come to the attention of him who is to be affected by it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2897.354" offset="11692805">The DuPont building is on one corner, the Miami Herald building is on the other, the Ingraham building is on another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.425" offset="11717047">There's a large department store on another, and one of the individuals in the case testified, and he was supported by the city engineer, that the matter of maintenance of these streets, because of these potholes that have been developing all the time, were so constant that they had to put him to do the work on Sundays.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.622" offset="11785906">And he said they never had made assessments against him before and why should he have thought that they were going to make assessments for street repairing, and it's a perfectly logical thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.708" offset="11830209">But to show, Your Honor, that they acted as promptly as they could and to correct the statement which was made by counsel yesterday, this case was not filed three years after this matter was instituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.187" offset="11880155">The assessment district in the Hamilton case, and by the way that may call for some explanation because some facetious comment was made by counsel regarding the fact that we tried the brief on one side and named it in the other, the case that we actually tried and we were solicited to participate in these proceedings by a group of property owners was the name of Hamilton.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.989" offset="11967300">The district was created before the Ganger District and we were ready and had taken our case -- or the city had taken our case to the Supreme Court of Florida before the Ganger case was ever filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.939" offset="12015156">And the Supreme Court of Florida held that the complaint was a valid -- or was attacked upon the ordinance and it had this notice in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.928" offset="12055071">So, the whole matter was tried on the assumption that we were trying the Hamilton case and the Ganger case, involving fewer streets in a much smaller district, sort of just came along with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.096" offset="12111705">When it got to the Supreme Court of Florida, for some unaccountable reason, the opinion was written in the Ganger case, but all the main briefs are dealing with these questions were entitled in the Hamilton case and that is why we have stressed the fact of Hamilton although, of course, the names make no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.340" offset="12180773">But now, on the question of this timing, the confirming resolution in the Hamilton district was added on March 18th, 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.313" offset="12240645">Then, the city sent bills to these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.918" offset="12251094">Counsel has said, “Well, we couldn't possibly have given them personal notice of the assessment because it would have been too expensive and the ownerships might have changed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.656" offset="12282023">But when they sent them the bills, they mailed it out to the right people and all of their names and addresses were on file with the city clerk, and they are in the records of this Court as represented by the assessment rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.680" offset="12334059">Now, within 48 days after that resolution was confirmed, we filed the Hamilton suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.232" offset="12364257">It was filed on May 5th, 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.418" offset="12377004">It went to -- the judge ruled in our favor on the motion to dismiss that complaint in July and it was decided in our favor per curiam on the Supreme Court of Florida in the following September.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.498" offset="12429354">So, it was not any lapse of time, such as two or three years, or any period like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.114" offset="12451819">It failed between the time of the doing -- the happening of these events and the challenge to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.988" offset="12471359">And indeed, I do not see how the people could have gotten together and gotten into Court much more quickly than they did and are about the same amount of time lapsed in the Ganger case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.171" offset="12512005">That suit was filed or the confirming resolution there was done in the year later, on February 18th, 1954, and the suit was filed on April 1st, fall.</text>
