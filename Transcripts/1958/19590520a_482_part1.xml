            <label>Mr. Dominick L. Manoli</label>
            <text syncTime="11.870" offset="150862">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.661" offset="162043">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.583" offset="185657">The National Labor Relations Act provides that when every charges is filed alleging the Commission of unfair labor practice, the Board may issue a complaint stating the charges in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.870" offset="246888">The principal question here is whether the Board's complaint must be confined to the allegations of the charge or whether the complaint may include matters or events which occur after the filing of the charge and pending the Board's investigation of that charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.528" offset="317524">The court below answered this question in the negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.614" offset="333824">And I shall faithfully summarize the facts which give rise to our problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.009" offset="359424">In 1953, the Board certified the union which is involved in these proceedings as the bargaining representative of the company's employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.479" offset="397249">Thereafter, between August of that year and November of the following year, representatives of the union and of the company engaged in a series of 20 almost -- about 20 conferences for the purposes of arriving a collective bargaining agreement but they were unable to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.246" offset="468407">Among the principle obstacles that prevented agreement were the company's insistence upon a contract which would give it the unilateral right during the life of the contract to either raise or lower the wages that were agreed to in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.535" offset="541550">The company's refusal to incorporate in any agreement provisions of the respect to existing employment practices at the plant despite the fact that some of these had been in existence for some time and despite the further fact that the company said that it had no present intention of changing them.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.961" offset="611244">And -- and further, the company's insistence upon a no-strike provision with a -- with a monetary penalty for its breach, coupled with the company's refusal to give to the union the normal quid pro quo for that kind of a -- an agreement, namely, a grievance procedure with arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.903" offset="690970">The company insisted that any grievances should be ultimately be -- ultimately be resolved by the presence of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.185" offset="724093">The atmosphere of these negotiations was not enhanced when, in April of 1954, the company made certain individual wage adjustments which the union had indicated that it want to discuss but the company did this, however, without first notifying or consulting with the union that it was putting these changes into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.970" offset="811238">In May of 1954, the union filed a charge with the Board and this charge alleged that the company had engaged and was engaging in unfair labor practice within the meaning of Section 85 of the Act, that's the bargaining provision of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.307" offset="880619">And also that the company on or about November 20th, 1953 had refused to bargain with the -- with the union collectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.884" offset="926908">The Board's Regional Director, with whom this charge was filed after investigation, informed the parties that he was declining to issue a complaint because in his view, the -- the investigation did not disclose sufficient evidence to support the issuance of a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.361" offset="1000782">The union thereupon appealed from the Regional Director's action to the Board's General Counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.383" offset="1028890">While the appeal was pending before the Board's General Counsel, the company and the union continued to negotiate.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.305" offset="1056580">And then October of 1954, the company unilaterally without prior notice or consultation with the union put into effect a -- a general wage increase for all of the employers and after having done so, notified the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.708" offset="1118229">In fact, the union discovered it quite fortuitously through the employers of another plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.874" offset="1146859">The negotiations continued after this unilateral action on the part of the employer for two more meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.512" offset="1169429">And on the last of these meetings, the company abruptly terminated the negotiations when it notified the union that it had worth -- word-of-mouth information that the union no longer represented a majority of the employees in the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.850" offset="1222823">The union reported these matters to the Board's Regional Director.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.439" offset="1237138">And shortly thereafter, the Board's Regional Director wrote to the parties, both to the union and to the company, that he was withdrawing his earlier refusal to issue a complaint on the union's charges and that the matter would be investigated further.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.269" offset="1308400">In August of that year, this was some time in January of 1955, in August of that year, the Board's General Counsel notified the parties that in view of the Regional Director's action withdrawing his earlier refusal to issue a complaint that all further inquiry should be addressed to the Regional Director.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.144" offset="1387917">And -- and shortly thereafter, the Regional Director issued a complaint against the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.107" offset="1411845">And the complaint, in relevant part, alleged that the company on and after November 21st, 1953 had refused to bargain collectively with the union in violation of the statute and further that on or about October 7th, 1954, 1954, the company had put into effect the unilateral wage increase without prior notice to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.336" offset="1524694">Upon the record that was made on this complaint before the Board's Hearing Officer, Hearing Examiner which also included the transcript of the negotiations between the company and the union that continued for nearly 15 months, the Board found that the record clearly evidenced the company's refusal throughout the course of the negotiations to bargain in good evidence -- clearly evidence the company's failure to bargain in good faith and that this conclusion was confirmed by the unilateral wage increase of October 1954.</text>

            <text syncTime="444.619" offset="1881840">Let's get it up then.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dominick_l_manoli" startTime="446.706" stopTime="1088.961">
            <label>Mr. Dominick L. Manoli</label>
            <text syncTime="446.706" offset="1890200">Now, because there has been some confusion as to the nature of the Board's findings with respect to the company's good faith, I believe it will be helpful because this will be significant later on in the course of the argument that I found to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.336" offset="1952684">If I may read very briefly, this is at page 119 of the record, the page upon top, 119, the Board said, "We have no difficulty in determining the respondent's bad faith throughout these protracted negotiations particularly in view of the respondent's unilateral effectuation of a general wage increase early in October 1954 while the negotiations were still in progress but without consultation with or even notice to the union," and then skipping over to page 128 in order to fill out this, at -- on page 126 rather at the bottom of that page, the Board in conclusionary term said, "We find rather that the giving of this general increase while negotiations were still continuing and in complete disregard of the union's representative status provide the final insight into the respondent's conduct of negotiations with the union.”</text>
            <text syncTime="515.058" offset="2163649">It clearly shows that after November 21st, 1953, the cutoff date determined by the General Counsel pursuant provisions of Section 10 (b), respondent was merely going through the motions of collective bargaining without a genuine intention of trying to negotiate an agreement over the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.045" offset="2231568">Now, the court below read the Board's decision to mean and parenthetically, I may say that we think it was an error, the court below read the Board's decision to mean that a part from the unilateral wage increase of October 1954, the record of the negotiations between the company and the union would not support, would not support a finding that the company had bargained in bad faith during these negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.180" offset="2332087">Accordingly, accordingly, the critical question for the court below became whether the Board's complaint could take cognizance of the unilateral wage increase which occurred after the filing of the union's charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.806" offset="2394572">The answer which the court below gave is this, “The principal opinion of the court below said that the Board's complaint must be confined to the specific allegations of the charge and that the Board's complaint may not take cognizance of the events which occur after the filing of the charge.”</text>
            <text syncTime="592.051" offset="2471581">The concurring opinion by Judge Hutcheson took the position that the unilateral wage increase of October was a completely new and independent cause of action unrelated, unrelated to the subject matter of the charge and that therefore, the Board was powerless to take that into consideration, Judge Reeves who dissented -- dissented on both counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.099" offset="2559770">It is our position that the Board may take cognizance, the Board may take cognizance of the events which occur after the filing of the charge which are either related to the subject matter of the -- which are either grow out of or are related to the subject matter of the charge pending the Board's investigation of the charge and secondly that the unilateral wage increase which took place here after the filing of charge is related to the subject matter of the charge which was filed in -- in May of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.918" offset="2706996">Now, let me address myself first to the second, what I regard as the subsidiary question, namely, whether the unilateral wage increase, which occurred after the filing of the charge, was related to the subject matter of the union's charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.886" offset="2774915">The charge, in effect, called upon the Board to investigate the bargaining relationship between the company and the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.109" offset="2811800">This unilateral wage increase took place in the course of that bargaining relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.018" offset="2831444">Indeed, it went to the very heart of that relationship for as this Court has set such action of that kind on the part of an employer constitutes the very antithesis of collective bargaining and a negation, and a negation of the union's representative status.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.427" offset="2897063">More than that, the unilateral wage increase was a further reflection, a further manifestation and further continuation, if you will, of the company's persistent attitude throughout the negotiations on the base which lead to the charge of the company's persistent attitude of maintaining a completely freehand with respect, with respect to the terms and the conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.973" offset="2995284">We think that in every meaningful, in any meaningful sense, it must be said that the unilateral wage increase of October is -- directly bears upon the bargaining relationship which the Board was called upon to investigate and is directly related to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.493" offset="3057351">The argument is made, however, that since the Board did not find that there was an unfair labor practice on the basis of the pre-charge conduct, that the post-charge unilateral wage increase is not related, is not related to the pre-charge conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.681" offset="3130075">Apart from the fact that this argument misreads initially, it misreads initially the Board's -- the Board's decision in this case because, as I said a moment ago and this is the one with the reasons why I read the Board's decision, the Board found that the company, throughout the course of these negotiations, had manifested at bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.840" offset="3202696">The argument is made that they say on this reading of the Board's -- on this reading of the Board's decision that there was no unfair labor practice on -- during -- committed during the time preceding the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.227" offset="3248253">The argument is made that the post-charge unilateral wage increase is not related to any unfair labor practice which is a subject of the -- of the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.402" offset="3284929">As I say, this does not only misreads the Board's decision but it doesn't hold any -- doesn't -- the argument doesn't have any merit because the critical factor is whether, for our purposes of relationship, for determining relationship in this context, the critical factors whether the post-charge events or matters have immaterial and logical connection with the subject matter, with the subject matter of the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.535" offset="3381478">Now, that connection exist or does not exist, it seems to us, without regard to what the Board's ultimate conclusions may be as to the legality or illegality of the conduct in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.214" offset="3432260">Now, let me turn now to what we believe is the principle question, the more important question in this case, namely, whether the Board may take cognizance of events or matters which occur after the filing of a charge but which are grow out of, as we or are -- as in this case, or are related to the subject matter of the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.580" offset="3533720">The principal opinion below, as I have indicated, took the positions that the complaint of the Board must be confined, must be confined to the subject -- to the -- the allegations of the charge and that the Board may -- may not look or take cognizance of the events which occur after the filing of the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.994" offset="3611355">We believe that this view rest upon a mistaken conception of what a charge is, what a complaint is, and what the Board's role is in the investigation on the prosecution of charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.497" offset="3669347">The statute provides, as I briefly alluded to a moment ago, the statute provides that when -- whenever a charge is filed alleging that a person is engaging or has engaged in unfair labor practices, the Board is empowered to issue a complaint stating the charges in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.025" offset="3747506">The statute also provides that the Board shall not issue a complaint with respect to unfair labor practice that occur -- that have occurred more than six months prior to the filing of the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.522" offset="3797452">Now, a charge under the statute may be filed by anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.558" offset="3813648">It is all compiled by people who, in the nature of things, have limited perception, understanding of the conducts to which they are complaining, its ramifications and its legal significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.295" offset="3860564">A charge is not a pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.176" offset="3868087">All that the charge does is merely set the Board's machinery in the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.546" offset="3889507">Now, once the -- the charge has been filed and the Board's machinery has been set in motion, then the -- the burden, the responsibility for investigating the charge rest with the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.376" offset="3936841">And if the Board determines on the basis of its investigation that a complaint should issue, like the complaint issues and the statute also expressly provides that the Board may amend that complaint at anytime prior to the issuance of a final order.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.377" offset="4000893">The statutory scheme, it seems to us, suggest that it is the Board's obligation to frame the issues between itself and the party charged and the complaint serves this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.508" offset="4049377">It has often been said that the case between the Board and the particular respondent starts not with the charge really but actually -- but rather with the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.412" offset="4085008">And this, we think, is in keeping with the underlying purposes of the statute, namely, that the Board's function is to vindicate public rights and not private rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1612.423" offset="6553057">And suggestions has been made here that here, there was no charge with respect to this post-charge unilateral wage increase and in some fashion or other, this particular restriction bars the Board from taking cognizance of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.429" offset="6613138">Now, I frankly think, Mr. Justice Harlan, that that provision has got nothing to do with our problem in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.555" offset="6641560">What that provision is, is a statute of limitations which simply says, which simply says that the Board may not base an unfair labor practice finding on matters which occurs six months prior to the filing of the charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="1822.345" offset="7392737">Mr. Chief Justice and if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.177" offset="7432129">First, by way of introduction in this case, I want to say to the Court that counsel here in this Court are the counsel who conducted the negotiations which are brought in to question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.337" offset="7540694">There is no embarrassment on the part of the counsel by reason of having engaged in those negotiations notwithstanding the charges that are made by the Labor Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.459" offset="7609240">Fant Milling Company is a relatively small industry engaged in the processing of wheat and grain manufacturing flour and feed, during -- was two plants, one in Sherman and one McKinney, Texas both near Red River.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.336" offset="7728671">The number of employees within what referred to as the bargaining unit or the hourly paid employees were about 200 at the time of the commencement of this proceeding that's now reached this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.227" offset="7820309">The union sought representation of those employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.796" offset="7834520">And in due course, an election was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.568" offset="7849671">And approximately, 180 of the 200 employees voted in the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.709" offset="7894183">Those voting for representations by the union outnumbered those voting against representation of -- by the union by about eight or exactly eight, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.377" offset="7968893">Counsel in this case in conducting or participating certainly more expressive and in participating in the negotiations made subject matter of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.798" offset="8062516">Sincerely as the capacity of counsel would permit attempted to serve the intent and purpose of the National Labor Relations Act thereby serving the public and likewise to the extent of the capacity of possessed attempted to serve the employees of Fant Milling Company as a part of the public and of course, attempted to serve Fant Milling Company are declined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.348" offset="8244746">Now, so that it may not be overlooked by the Court, at the outset, it is an adjudicated fact in this case, so adjudicated by the Fifth Circuit that in this matter, this country milling company paid two local attorneys, one living in Paris and one in Sherman against the experts of who were representing the union in the negotiations or the employees, if you please.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.338" offset="8424678">So let us not be misled by the statement of counsel for the Board or General Counsel rather with reference to charges being made by uninformed persons or persons who are not informed to the extent that they know how to frame charges.</text>
