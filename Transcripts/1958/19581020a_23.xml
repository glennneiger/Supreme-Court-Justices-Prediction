            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="36.446" offset="249187">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.869" offset="294849">The issue in this case is whether under the decision of this Court in Mobile, a natural gas company may file schedules changing its rates unless it has a specific agreement in regard to the amount of those rates although it has reserved the right in its agreement to file such schedules under the statute subject to the Commission's approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.178" offset="464123">The United Gas Company pipeline filed such schedules on September 30th, 1955, materially increasing the rates, changing the rates that it had under a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.534" offset="549491">The Commission found that it had the power to file such schedule to change rates by reason of the terms of its contract and the reservations that it had made under that contract for that power and rejected the Motions of the respondents to reject such filed rates which motions were on the ground that Mobile prohibited the filing of such rates unless there was an expressed agreement to the specific level of the rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.199" offset="720123">The Court of Appeals reversed this action of the Commission I might say first, was taken after the rates were filed and suspended after the 30-day period, all of the rates, except those that were only industrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.359" offset="812805">The rest of them were suspended in accordance with Section 4 (e) for the five months period and then they were subject to refund under that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.147" offset="875917">The Court of Appeals held that there was no right to file even though they accepted the construction for the purposes of this case of the Commission of a contract between the parties and that the reservation did provide for such filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.398" offset="960972">The Court held that unless there was an agreement to the specific rate that was filed, that Mobile prohibited the filing and therefore, reversed the decision of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.408" offset="1048952">Now, the agreement that is involved is set out on page 7 of our brief and it is crucial to this controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.873" offset="1102869">We think that in light of the Commission's action and the Court of Appeals' acceptance for the purposes of this case of that construction or finding by the Commission that this Court should accept that it's supported by substantial evidence in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.455" offset="1185207">And therefore, the agreement should be found like the Court -- as the Commission found it and that filing should be accepted by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.201" offset="1232227">But the language and the question of the defect of a language is raised as one other points by the respondents and we therefore would like to call to your attention partially.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.453" offset="1293145">The language that is of particular importance in this question is the fourth line “or any effective superseding rate schedules on file with the Federal Power of Commission.”</text>
            <text syncTime="313.121" offset="1355839">It's a question of what effective superseding rate schedules where any on file with the Federal Power of Commission mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.407" offset="1404949">The United contends that that means not only the rate schedules that were filed on a particular day of this agreement, but any that would be filed superseding or taking their place under the provisions of the Act, Section 4 (d) and that that where the Respondents said that they will pay which is in the first line, for the gas delivered shall be paid for by the buyer under the seller's rate schedules and such superseding schedule.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="362.937" offset="1555101">Apart from, excuse me, apart from the reference to the rate schedule, was there any specific price referred to in the contract?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="372.567" stopTime="482.920">
            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="372.567" offset="1593657">The contract was a part of the tariff-service agreement rate schedules that the Commission developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.813" offset="1634617">It started back in 1940, but later largely after 1945 -- 1948 and the Order 144 that it promulgated at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.459" offset="1681220">And the concept of that program of rate schedule was to have the rates set out in a tariff schedule and then in the service agreement that was made with all of the contracting customer, they would refer to that rate schedule, but the rates could not be set up as such in the service agreement with the idea that if they put them in the service agreement, there would be a tendency to make individual rates in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.007" offset="1799398">And the purpose of Order 144 and that system of rate program was to try to have the rates effective as to areas and not as to individuals customers and the purpose behind that was to get away from the discrimination and preferences that had been discovered throughout the various industry hearings that the Commission had dealt with.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.514" offset="1913396">And they thought by having the rates in the separate tariff and the changes in the rates in separate tariffs, then the Service agreement would be made with the customers and refer to those rates would not have a separate individual rate for every separate customer and each customer would not have to look to every other service agreements to see whether someone else in similar situation had a better deal than he did so he could raise the question of preference.</text>

            <text syncTime="482.920" offset="2035022">Were those services being (Inaudible) which just means as I remember the time in the Mobile case --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="488.501" stopTime="489.132">
            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="488.501" offset="2057383">That's right.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="489.132" offset="2059891">And my question is, was there -- as there was in the Mobile contract, a special rate as distinguished from the rate that was prescribed in the ordinary tariffs that were en banc.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="501.067" stopTime="1633.008">
            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="501.067" offset="2107643">No, the Mobile contract was distinctly different.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.897" offset="2123003">And there were some 18 contracts of that type that were filed with the Commission and those had a specific rate and no provision in the service agreement or the contract for any change whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.346" offset="2184756">Now, this contract started out before 1948 with a -- an agreement between the parties for service and it also had detailed escalation provisions which are known in the trade as provisions for price increases based upon this difference in tax rates that are assessed or cost of living or anything of that type.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.265" offset="2324459">And they were specific in contemplating flexible rate structures that will be adjusted from time to time as changes in cost developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.609" offset="2373778">Now, in order to get away from some of these problems, the preference and discrimination and these escalation provisions -- the escalation provisions that they developed in the industry and the difficulty the Commission had to determine what the rate structures were and how the discriminations occurred and who they affected, the Commission decided to try to develop this tariff-and-service agreement program and they tried started out in 1940 with it the war and interrupted it and it was until 1948 that they could really develop and put it into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.861" offset="2554859">But for example, here is a group of contracts and there were six files of this type that for United alone, the gas pipeline involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.301" offset="2608567">Now, in order to try to find out if you're a rate expert, what your particular customer might be involved in with regard to whether some customer in the same group of area and type of the same rate in fact would be entitled to and so that you would find out whether the discrimination of preference against to your customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.394" offset="2708982">And you would have to go through all of these and try to find out, compare all these contracts and if that involve not only the rate itself but the time of delivery and the place of delivery and different differentials that would be involved in negotiation and the amount of gas that was furnished.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.075" offset="2787662">Then you'd also have to look at the supplements which for certain rates and provisions of that type, were replaced and would have to go through all of that kind of procedures in order to find out what the situation was that you've raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.171" offset="2852028">Now, it was so bad that with the -- the Panhandle Eastern, they developed gas shortage and it was a question of how they were going to supply all of these customers and what their relationship should be to eliminate the discrimination and preferential treatment that would be involved if they didn't treat them on a fair basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.484" offset="2957354">So, the Commission had that problem to determine how to handle prior to 1948 when they involved this tariff-and-service agreement system.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.152" offset="2999986">And in trying to deal with that, they found many, many preferences within discriminations that had developed, that had not come to light before that at all, but as soon as the shortage developed, then the customers all came and said, “Well, how this happened that my situation is like this other one and that was comparable?”</text>
            <text syncTime="745.318" offset="3084622">And they had to go through the whole system and reallocate to eliminate the preferences and discriminations that had developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.248" offset="3120358">And there were -- there was another case, a similar kind where they discovered it only after 5 (a) hearing the discriminations and preferences that occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.799" offset="3162572">Now, under this tariff-and-service agreement system, we have a file like this that the customer or a rate expert can look at.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.017" offset="3211473">And he can determine and see what the schedule is in one place above the tariff provides for the rates and then there is -- at the back, a listing of every customer and what rate it is sold out and then there's a type of service agreement that is set out in the tariff's schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.158" offset="3304051">That is the only service agreement that the pipeline can use to sell his gas unless he gets special permission on a regulation from the Commission and can show a reason why the service agreement should be different for this particular sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.616" offset="3377821">And you can see what difference that make the way the expert turn at the back, he can see what other customers that are comparable sold out, he can turn to this tariff schedule and he can turn it to the service agreement and he can find out exactly what his customer is getting, what he should get in order to be fairly treated along with other comparable cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.611" offset="3457860">Now, that is basic to the problem in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.897" offset="3486908">First, however, I'd like to turn to the -- what Mobile held.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.832" offset="3518673">As we understand Mobile, it did not at all that there had to be any agreement to a specific rate in order to file under 4 (d) or 4 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="865.037" offset="3563499">What we believe Mobile held was just this, that it did not set aside contracts and if you had a contract that provided that your rate was -- I think it was ten-seven-tenth cents the file in cubic feet in that case, and you have no provision for a change of that rate and you had it for 10-year period that the Act did not say you had any right to change it.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.633" offset="3669870">That's entirely and solely what that case held.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.195" offset="3684185">The case also held that you could have ex parte rates and that if you -- as we read it, if you had any provision for changes, you go back to the contract law separate apart from the Act and if under contracts, you have a right to make a change, you still have that under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.317" offset="3772688">The Act did not add anything to it except the right of review in order that the Commission could protect the public interest under 4 (d) and 4 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="928.290" offset="3816573">One further thing we read in to the act is that of 4 (d) and 4 (e), the test of what is lawful is the same as under 5 (a) in that -- that the same structure and they have to be read together.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.040" offset="3879581">Commission so interprets it and so applies it.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.888" offset="3894941">It's also a question of -- there are some question raised in the case as to whether there's a different rule applied and whether there's an advantage to the consumer if you forced the examination of the rate under 5 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="964.182" offset="3960142">Now, you recall that 4 (d) and 4 (e) is an entirely different structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.493" offset="3981354">It provides for jurisdiction in the sense of rate fixing and the rates can be filed, the schedule of rates under 4 (d) and 4 (e), there has to be a notice as this Court said in Mobile and then the Commission can consider during that period of time after the filing of notice whether or not with the showing that's made, the rate should be suspended or should be allowed to go into effect and they go in to effect at the end of 30 days if the Commission does not act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.271" offset="4120430">And they go in to effect that this Court said in Mobile because of the contract between the parties or because the gas company files a rate and they do not going to affect because of the Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.597" offset="4177795">Then after that happens, the Commission may suspend the rates and set a hearing and that's what it did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.747" offset="4210395">And during that hearing, under its regulations, it requires that the burden fall upon the -- the person who files the rates to prove that they -- the proposed rates are not unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or unduly preferential and that's the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.473" offset="4301302">And in effect, the Commission always applies that test to determine whether or not it's -- the rates are lawful, applies them back against the structure of rates before and determines whether or not under that test, they are the lowest rates that will make a fair return plus the cost of doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.507" offset="4393357">And it is construed as a pin point as distinguished from a general area of rates that might be fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.975" offset="4439228">Well, that's what we think that Mobile means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.918" offset="4459081">Now, the experience of the industry was that except in rare cases like Mobile made such contracts that I just referred to, the industry recognized there had to be some flexibility to rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.829" offset="4526686">By the nature of the industry, there had to be some type of long-term contracts because the investments were very great in these long pipelines over the country and it required large engagement of capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.464" offset="4589275">It also required some permanency to the relationships with the distributors because they involved themselves in substantial investments to provide this service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.715" offset="4634206">So in light of that, contemplation of long-term agreements between the parties, there had to be -- it was recognized there had to be some provision for flexibility in rates to take care of the different costs and different levels of cost of doing businesses, cost of all kinds of materials and labor changed from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.698" offset="4722186">There also had to be some kind of a provision that would encourage capital to invest in this industry and provide the necessary funds for expansion as the country grew and needed the development of additional pipeline carrying capacity in order to take care of the distributor's needs for the various suburban developments that have been characteristic of this country from before the war period -- before it interrupted in ever since to very rapid manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.899" offset="4867009">Now, there have been substantial rate increases asked by these companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.371" offset="4888848">In every case, the Commission has suspended the rates and set them for a hearing in order to look at the consumer interest and seeing if the rate was proper and lawful under the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.269" offset="4940466">But I'm here to say that, I think this Court under its decisions in the past and in this case, must be interested as they access first in the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.075" offset="4991666">That the consumer also has the interest in the ability of these companies to perform their contracts and to meet the demands of this country in its growth and if they cannot continue to receive the capital and attract capital that is needed for the growth by getting a fair return, then the country is hurt, the consumer is hurt and that is part of this picture that we must look at in considering this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.262" offset="5128443">The most important element of this case to the Commission is the effect that it has upon the structure that it has created of these separate tariff and separate service agreement structure of rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.755" offset="5202422">I'll tell you why that is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.156" offset="5212035">No agency of Government has enough money to do all the jobs that's given to it by Congress and time after time, this Court has seen that it has the ability to only do so much of that job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.938" offset="5275146">So that, whatever funds it has, if it's going to regulate properly and in the interest of the country, it has to use to the greatest advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.468" offset="5313285">And any system of rate structure that is as much as possible self-enforced and self-regulatory that it puts up sign posts and warning signs to the customers and the public generally of what -- of whether discriminations which are prohibited by this Act, undue discriminations and undue preferences, any place that you can have those sort of the customer can come along and say, “Here, how did this happen?</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.083" offset="5435747">They can't do that to me.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.951" offset="5443166">Instead of the Commission have to dig it up through a labyrinth of papers and before we had a situation where there were some 8,000 pages of these contracts as against some 388 pages, that's the kind of a situation that this tariff-and-service agreements program of rate structure developed as contrasted with the old contract system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.948" offset="5551208">Now, it's argued by the respondents, well, this whole situation can be taken cared of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.804" offset="5578585">You can still file under 4 (d) and have it heard under 4 (e) if you get an agreement and you ought to be able to get an agreement on the rate from everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.624" offset="5621844">There shouldn't be too much trouble about that, but I have tried to carefully examine this and I don't believe that's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.272" offset="5656430">I don't think that you can get the agreement unless the parties are in rather considerable parity as to their bargaining positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.498" offset="5701360">Now, you must keep in mind under 4 (d) and 4 (e), the rates are suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.921" offset="5727065">There is a refund provision except as to industrial and I will cover that in a moment, but otherwise, those rates are paid all during the interim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.569" offset="5765622">Under 5 (a), if the rate is established there, it's only prospective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.419" offset="5797073">It can't cover the back period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.211" offset="5808253">Now, you take the distributor who doesn't want to expand his operation, is satisfied with the -- with the gas that he is getting, there is every interest in the world for him to not agree to anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.737" offset="5866350">Because he's says, it's their contention, you go under 5 (a) at that point, you can't file under 4 (d) and if it takes 2 years, 3 years, 18 months, whatever you can chase it down to and it's been as much as six years to have a 5 (a) hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.231" offset="5944299">Let's say you can get them cut down further 18 months, during that 18-month period, while the cost of doing business is going up with the gas pipeline and all the cost of labor and living and materials and so forth, the Commission can't do a thing about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.521" offset="6021413">It can only make a rate that starts from the day that that hearing into it fixes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.772" offset="6046490">It can't even go back to the dates where they started the hearing and fixed the rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.382" offset="6068851">So, you would never get an agreement with the distributing company and that's the kind of situation unless you wanted to extend this operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.912" offset="6103019">Now, you can trade out in that kind of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.740" offset="6122350">Possibly, the fact that you got additional gas and wants to have another development, you could take care of and other factors of that kind if you can find it, but in every case, you couldn't even find those.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.123" offset="6175848">In some cases, the distribution company would be a better trader than others then what will you have?</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.578" offset="6205733">You will have the to follow that has no reason to trade out if you make some agreement of any kind or very little and finally does and you file under 4 (d) and 4 (e), you will have the one that has reason and he makes a different rate and you will have all kinds of rates involved all over the place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.426" offset="6289115">And then you will have to go under a 4 (e) hearing to try to straighten out all those preferences and discriminations that have been built by this old contract method of arriving at rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.756" offset="6338435">And it is -- will be very destructive of trying to protect the consumer interest and trying to have this picture uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.743" offset="6374379">Not that everybody pays the same rate, but everybody that's in the same area or group where there isn't a good reason for him to pay a different rate gets the same rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.595" offset="6413772">And it does help the Commission by the people in the industry working at it to get rid of this discrimination better than any other idea that has been now developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.321" offset="6472704">Now, there is another -- in regard to industrial rates, I would like to cover that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.689" offset="6498095">The statute does not provide for the suspension of industrial rates as such if the rate is set as to industry, there is no provision for suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.074" offset="6551698">If it covers both industry and other rates, then, the Commission has always taking position that it is a suspendable rate and the greatest portion of the gas that's subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission is sole suspendable, not non-suspendable rates.</text>

            <text syncTime="1678.954" offset="6819192">There are seven companies engaged in only industrial rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.846" offset="6838732">They amount at the present time to approximately 2%, I think a little less than 2% of the whole jurisdictional structure of rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.379" offset="6880841">So that approximately 98% of the rates are suspendable jurisdictional rates and only 2% are these that are non-suspendable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.516" offset="6925458">Now, I'll tell you another thing about those.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.597" offset="6933713">Why does anybody buy that kind of a rate?</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.416" offset="6949073">The Commission has urged for years almost since the Act was passed in 1938 that they changed this to make those rates suspendable and if the League of Municipalities and some of the industries would come forward and help, I'm certain they'd get a change, but there's a good reason why at least the industries don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.186" offset="7032142">You take the Pacific Northwest that's referred by -- to -- by response in their brief and you will find that there was a rate of two cents per -- per term and it was proposed to increase that rate to two-and-a-half cents per term for these various industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.801" offset="7134542">The suspendable rate was, as I recall three cents and it was proposed to increase it to three-and-eight-tenths.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.155" offset="7183966">Now, the toll in the industry that had bought the two or that was going to increase to two-and-a-half, could pay during the non-suspension period at the increased rate and be way ahead of paying the suspendable rate and that's apparently true throughout the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.640" offset="7269961">Now I don't want to represent this always through because I haven't searched the whole picture as to whether it all fits that way, but it looks like it -- that is the picture and I can readily understand why anybody that's buying gas on that kind of a basis doesn't come in and urge --- that be suspendable because what he is doing, it's just like when you buy insurance or any other commodity, you're buying a different commodity and you're getting a better rate because you don't have the suspendible provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.584" offset="7389706">He takes the risk of whether or not it's going to get a price increase and -- in many and most cases he would have opportunity to take the suspendible provision at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.064" offset="7443623">And he chooses deliberately and purposely to make the other type of contract because he'd better off and he's got a cheaper cost for his gas even though it's not suspendible during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.066" offset="7567653">Now throughout this growth of this industry and it has been rapid, it has been recognized that there has to be a flexible rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.834" offset="7614673">There has to be some provision or changes and modifications of the rate structure as the pipelines and distribution systems and other gas services people developed and have greater needs in the community, and also to take care of the costs of doing business and practically without exception, they always provide it for this escalation clause as I have described it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.716" offset="7738284">Now, the Commission determined when it developed in 1948, this rate structure, the tariff-and-service agreement, they wanted to get away from these escalations provisions and a part of that was that there would be -- there was a recognition in the industry that with those clauses, generally, the customer could not come in and resist or object to the proposed rates at the hearing because he'd already agreed to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.941" offset="7867120">He got -- the provision in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.892" offset="7878928">So, the Commission was going to eliminate them entirely in 144 proceeding and United objected to that, and said that they thought that would be a change in their substantive rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.439" offset="7933158">And, the Commission said, it was not trying to change substantive rights in that proceeding which is a regulation proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.795" offset="7958549">It wasn't a place for -- it should be changed in substantive rights and they provided that there could be a reservation of the right under certain conditions to change the rate and make a filing under the provisions of Section 4 (d) and by that, they also, by the Order number 144, they generally eliminated the escalation, but they expressly provided for this provision that they couldn't revive their rates and it would be subject to Commission review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.500" offset="8109328">Now, the Commission when it reviews these rates, is not arbitrator or deciding a controversy between the pipeline and its distribution company as private parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.582" offset="8169723">It's deciding what in the public interest is a lawful rate and it was applied the statute for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.102" offset="8199816">So, it isn't in any way acting in the ordinary sense of trying to determine what the best rate is for these two companies to pay each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.807" offset="8234611">Of course this Court has said that mustn't the primary interest of the statute termed by Congress is to keep in mind the consumer that he is the primary interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.333" offset="8276720">And so, in passing in 4 (e) or 5 (a), as I've told you the Commission applied exactly the same principles and standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.149" offset="8331995">It has to determine as a regulatory body for this in the public interest as a lowest reasonable rate as lawful that can be applied and, that's his function and that's what it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.578" offset="8397720">So that -- and one other thing I would like to cover and I want to reserve some of my time and that is, in regard to the independent producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.864" offset="8478804">Suggestion is made that the Commission is not acting as, maybe it should or in the best faith, in regard to the independent producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.796" offset="8522585">Now, I want to tell the Court upon careful inquiry to the Commission that I have been advised, they are acting under the Philips' case, there is no question may be accepted and followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.521" offset="8569501">They're following the City of Detroit to do it and they're trying as rapidly as they can to meet the problem of the regulation of independent producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.159" offset="8608057">There isn't any question as this Court -- Court well recognized in the Philips' decision that there's got to be regulation of that level in order to protect the consumer interests, otherwise we just keep on spiraling up in that point, but the problem has been great.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.384" offset="8680887">They have over 11,000 balances of independent producers that they have suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.713" offset="8710248">They're trying to work them through as fast as they can.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.826" offset="8722683">They have increased their force 50%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.498" offset="8733341">They've gotten approval from the budget to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.857" offset="8750791">Why don't they increase it more?</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.801" offset="8758627">It's impossible because, it takes lawyers, great experts and engineers and people of that kind who have some knowledge to help them with their work and they recruit them as fast as they can.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.773" offset="8802513">Now they hope that at least by 1961 and they're working at it as fast as they can, they'll have that out of the way and they looked forward to the system like this of the tariff-and-service agreement structure of regulation in that area as soon as they can get on top of the situation that way, so that it will help to regulate itself in the same manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.088" offset="8923721">I would like to reserve the rest of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2217.081" offset="8971682">-- may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.835" offset="8982758">On behalf of petitioner Natural Gas and Pipeline; United Gas Pipeline Company, Petitioner in number 23, I would like to speak in subordination to the solicitor General presentation because his client of the Federal Power Commission is very much in control of the Interstate operations of this petitioner as all other pipelines and Interstate suppliers of Natural Gas for resale, but at the same time I would like to devote myself if I may upon his shoulders because in this petition and our request for reversal of the Court below, we speak for a commercial interest with great importance, not only to ourselves as we can see, but to the gas consuming public and the industries who would use this pipe or fuel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.532" offset="9293511">United Gas Pipeline itself, one of the larger transporters of natural gas interstate, it has 24,000 miles of transmission; it sells gas and other line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.810" offset="9346591">It sells gas at wholesale only and the single fact of this case and agreements of all consumers represented by briefs file before the Court, it has had to pay and on is increasing prices for natural gas since the early forties, none an unusual thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.176" offset="9436035">A fuel is so valuable as characterized by Justice Jackson in the Hope case, which has been adapted now to so much residential and so much industrial consumer use of all kinds by the Interstate pipeline that have --- the country through miracles of technical adaptation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.029" offset="9523493">If not wonderful that this limited supply despite explorations, constant and expensive exploration has resulted in the constant bidding of the price of gas and field, so that in the relatively static -- when in -- as against the relatively static stage of the industry, say in the early 1940s just after the enactment of the Natural Gas Act, a field competitive price with 3 or 4 cents per thousand cubic feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.994" offset="9659329">Today it's running up to 24 and 25 cents per thousand cubic feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.781" offset="9678451">And that's simply because people want it and because there's no way of controlling finally the price of a valuable commodity in short supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.709" offset="9722232">Now, through pipelines of this petitioner, their flow annualized over last year the incredible volume of 1,250,000,000,000 cubic feet of natural gas and other pipelines are as large and many are almost as large, so that the cost of constantly replacing this wasting asset, in exploration is a (Inaudible) and hence, rate increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.889" offset="9846888">We make no apology for the fact, and that the proceeding out of which the present motion to dismiss and reject filings arose was an application for rate increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.091" offset="9907702">It has been succeeded by other necessary applications for which I'll speak in a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.816" offset="9930585">If I mention to the Court that 1 cent addition for thousand cubic feet for the price of gas means $10 million a year approximately additional cost of service and that 90% of the costs of service are represented in these filings that I will exhibit to the Court is the cost of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.512" offset="10017416">You will see why that must necessarily be so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.343" offset="10032776">Now, our case here as I say -- said rests upon the Solicitor General's case, and the tariff and filed service agreement formula that the Commission has, I think it's fair to say, imposed upon the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.698" offset="10106128">I think that imposition was no doubt a wise one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.739" offset="10122324">It has facilitated the understanding of the gas charges simplified and made uniform the tariffs, rates and classifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.521" offset="10161507">But it is a form in which the parties, the parties here, and other pipelines, and natural gas companies whose pricing methods may be affected by Your Honors' decision, it is a practice which has been imposed by Order 144 as of the year 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.659" offset="10262026">Your Honors, bear in mind that the Natural Gas Act dates from 1938, you will note that for 10 years, the Commission administered its regulation by requiring the filing of all contractor's rate schedules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.110" offset="10339767">And the Mobile contract which you had before you in 350 United States was one of those originally filed contracts filed and approved as of 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.462" offset="10389191">And as intimated in a question from the bench, it was a special contract in that it was a fixed price contract for 10 years filed as a pertinent to a resale contract, also fixed price, to the Ideal Cement Company dependent upon the sale contract and it had no provision for price change of any kind or character.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.624" offset="10493889">Now, the decision of this Court in that case concerning which have we have no quarrel whatever here, as we think most inappropriately had been used, or distillations from it I think used, to invalidate a 20-year contract in this tariff-and-service-and-agreement form that I'll enlarge upon in a moment, with language not found in the Mobile case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.676" offset="10638085">True, as was intimated, there was in the record and before the Commission, in the Mobile case, a regular service agreement which around 1955 or 1956 has been executed by Mobile, but that was not in question in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.547" offset="10717602">The motion to reject, which Your Honors' sustained, was insofar as the increase affected the fixed price contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.183" offset="10756054">Now, the decision of the Court which is carefully limited to the facts has been by the court below, I think to the great injury of the industry and the public, enlarged to apply to this contract which provides in a service agreement where payment under a designated rate schedule, “or any effective superseding rate schedules on file with the Federal Power Commission.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.802" offset="10850617">Those words or any effective superseding rate schedules have been completely ignored in the construction by the Court, although given their true value by the Commission on the facts to indicate a promise to pay the effective rates from time to time on part, that was the finding of the Commission based on all the evidence, but we are confronted with an application through a misconstruction of Your Honors' decision, which deletes those words from the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.216" offset="11000247">Now, may I spend a little more time on the contract because, while the issue here affects at least nine pipeline companies with identical language for change, and the great many others were somewhat similar language, there are special facts in the situation at the United Gas Pipeline Company which are laid hold off by the respondents to argue that those words don't mean what we say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.594" offset="11141726">United Gas Pipeline Company, as the Solicitor General intimated, resisted the new tariff arrangement set forth in Order 144.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.017" offset="11183417">It felt that that tariff arrangement, service agreement arrangement, which required the restatement of all contracts, deprived it of substantive contract rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.229" offset="11232319">Litigation resulted which was tendered to this Court, which resulted in some amendment of the tariff provision and Order 140 -- part 154 of the regulations thus promulgated to permit existing contracts to be restated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.644" offset="11301909">To preserve their special clauses pending their life provided that the filing companies thereafter operated in the tariff-and-service agreement form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.214" offset="11340257">That was done, but the result was that the United Gas Pipeline came late to this system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.288" offset="11372544">So Your Honors will find the first filing which it may the so-called “conversion tariff” appeared in July 1952, and this filing for an increase out of which this motion arises in September 1955 and since then, it's adverted into in my -- brief of my friend's opposite there had been other filings which they label, “unilateral increases.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.535" offset="11497514">It's a ratable most in a year because the price of gas has gone up and we are limited in our filings for rate increases strictly by these regulations to a showing -- a cost showing, building up a rate-base from which a fixed rate of return will yield revenue, distributed on a cost of service allocation to the different rate zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.972" offset="11619244">Now, here is a picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.374" offset="11628857">Here is in fact a file of September 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.280" offset="11656443">It proceeds by setting forth the new rate schedules and those to purchasers, Your Honors will find in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.343" offset="11712763">Then it gives an index, it gives an explanation of the series of the new rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.082" offset="11735751">It gives three (Inaudible), including a flowchart, and then it gives in great detail as demanded for the regulations that I call your attention, calculations of cost of plant, cost of gas, requirements of an -- return to investors, comparative earnings price ratios, and so on and so on with meticulous detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.105" offset="11839822">Now, Your Honors, this filing is not a mere dropping at in the Office of the Commissioner or mailing a letter to the Commission as some of our adversaries might incur.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.300" offset="11888619">If the Commission staff on examining this finds it does not comply with the form exacted by the regulation, this is rejected out of hand and we're given time to -- to repair the deficiency, the deficiency letter technique is used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.845" offset="11950791">And this filing is not only posted in the Office of the Commission, but it's mailed to all the important large volume purchasers and selected schedules are mailed to all the distributors that purchase from us so that they can comment with knowledge during the Commission's inquiry on -- on filing on the suspended -- in the suspension period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.788" offset="12046503">Now, what are the rate schedules to which this filing and subsequent filings are in amendment as permitted by the statue, and the contract?</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.977" offset="12099271">They appear in general structure at the beginning of the record, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.086" offset="12143679">Those are 1952 rate schedules and I'm informed that they have now been superseded in many respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.633" offset="12181922">You will note after the first 20 pages, a series of pages called General Terms and Conditions, and then you will find in the general form and in the General Terms and Conditions provisions as to the service agreement on page 44.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.131" offset="12287875">And in the tariff separately you will find on page 47 a form of service agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.361" offset="12324864">Those are all at their inception cut in combination a complete original tariff and which includes as you will note the form of service agreement or contract between the forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.597" offset="12397798">Now, to illustrate how those rates of charges which the Solicitor General explained as being uniform and published to the world, articulated with the contract for purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.869" offset="12446804">May I ask Your Honors to look at one of the more recent contracts at page 305 of the record which is open to a class.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.780" offset="12498526">This rate schedule, at the bottom of the page, is available to any natural gas pipeline company hereinafter called bio and on page 306 you will find the rate for natural gas service as a demand charge and a commodity charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.300" offset="12568534">I won't take the time to illustrate the different types of rates, but the Commission currently controls the classification of those rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.335" offset="12604688">And then the rate on page 3 in this generally filed schedule dated 1954 is articulated with a service agreement at page 94 which happens to be that of Southern Natural Gas Company also a petitioner and the service agreement you will note provides the scope of the agreement, delivery point and pressure, volumetric obligations, other matters of negotiations between the parties as to the type of service and on page 970 under Article 4, you will find the article price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.172" offset="12760064">All gas delivered shall be paid for by a buyer on the seller's rate schedule or any effective superseding rate schedules on file with the Federal Power Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="3188.177" offset="12856090">That these forms are prescribed by regulatory authority, exercised under statutory power and that the service agreement is intended to refer so they continue the service agreement in its price clause it refers to the continually changing series of rate schedules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.847" offset="12946787">And -- and so intended by all parties as testified below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.820" offset="12966640">In other words, I direct Your Honor's attention to the peculiar form of this to show that despite the impact of the regulation, it is essentially contractual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.117" offset="13007809">And I avail myself of the extensive treatment of the liberty of the contract of the gas companies in Your Honor's opinion in the Mobile case and particularly, I address myself with the language at page 342 where the Court said that in the Mobile contract, there was no power to change if the purported change is one that the natural gas company has the power to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.424" offset="13121076">The change is completed upon compliance with the notice requirement and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.353" offset="13140825">I say that -- that the parties understood that the filing of a new schedule under -- in connection with the service agreement, especially calling attention to effective superseding rate schedules, embraces just the type of change to which this Court especially left the way open in the Mobile case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.930" offset="13223058">And I contrast that which to me the completely unintended and unintelligible insistence of our adversaries that this Court decided in the Mobile case, there could not be a new rate until the buyer had specifically agreed to the price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.579" offset="13297664">Now, I'm digressing because I let on to Your Honor's inquiry, but in connection with what -- this was -- the Solicitor General said about a rate investigation under Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.935" offset="13347088">May I mention to Your Honors that without any criticism or whatever of the Federal Power Commission by reason of the smallest of its staff, the investigation under G1428 began on October 1948, lasted 10 years and finished last year and the contention of our adversaries is that during that period, our cost study which was necessary, we could not recover the price of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.881" offset="13450846">We would be out of business if that was so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.546" offset="13469550">I know that's quite impractical, let me address myself to the other angle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.670" offset="13486059">What would be the sense in asking all the customers of United Gas Pipeline Company to agree to a particular rate change?</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.966" offset="13547186">Can we ask them to read these two volumes?</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.676" offset="13558053">Well Your Honors, have an amicus brief offered before you in which the City of Harrisburg says, “It's an imposition on us to make us read those volumes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.751" offset="13590340">We can't understand them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.736" offset="13602356">How can the four pipeline purchasers, the four pipeline transportation customers, the six cities in Alabama, the five cities in Florida, the 14 cities in Louisiana, the 13 cities in Mississippi, the seven cities in Texas, our company's distributors buying directly from us and the 59 cities in Texas buying from the United Gas Corporation gas that we sell with, how can they negotiate new contracts with us in any kind of unison in any reasonable period of time?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.018" offset="13767450">As Mr. General as well said, you can only expect coming to the consensual agreement if there will be an inequality of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.628" offset="13805902">If for example, the new distributor needs or the consumer needs more gas, I'm told that the contracts affecting the 59 towns in Texas served by United Gas Corporation are in effect although not in terms of requirements contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.564" offset="13881657">They can't need more gas in an effective way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.673" offset="13894092">And to deal with each of them would have to deal with each of their city councils, and to deal with each of the communities and purchasers in the other States would have to deal with their State Commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.524" offset="13937455">We'll never be through and when we got through, we'll be bound to be the very disparities, the alleged discriminations, the inequalities, the variations of rate zones, the departures from allocated costs which would bring us as Mr. Rankin said, into a Section 4 (e) proceeding to rectify discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.843" offset="14022719">Wholly useless and most injurious alternative and one from which I think we're clearly entitled to be rescued by the terms of our contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.489" offset="14065351">Now I'd like in the remaining time of my initial presentation to refer to the terms of the contract in connection with the legal -- with the legal analysis and characterization of those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.394" offset="14124910">I have referred to Your Honors in our brief and I will not take time now, the controlling process of the regulations which appears in our Appendix, the White Appendix at pages 8 (a) and following, and the portions that I particularly mentioned in connection with the rate increase filing that I've showed to the Court would appear at page 20 (a) and the following in 15463, materials submitted with changes in the tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.225" offset="14328247">At page 21 (a), if the proposed change in tariff or rate schedule will result in a major increase in rates or charges, there shall be submitted Statement A to M inclusive described hereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.017" offset="14387388">And then omitting other detail, I direct Your Honors' attention to statements A to M beginning at the foot of page 24 (a) beginning with overall cost of service, rate base and return, cost of plant and so on in utmost detail as to which we have no hearing nor complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.839" offset="14470771">It's an incident in regulation and running down through statement M.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.241" offset="14496371">Now, as I understand, if a filing of this character by inadvertence skips or mishandles anyone of those details is rejected out of hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.154" offset="14535973">We haven't made a filing yet or initiated a change in rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.221" offset="14552273">The surveillance is most -- is most exacting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.182" offset="14568051">So, that the intimations in the briefs opposing, this covers industrial waste too, the information in briefs opposing that the rate changing procedure under Section 4 is just the means jacking up rates by writing letters and as soon as one increases refuse to write another letter is quite superficial and oblivious of the true facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.763" offset="14650389">Now, as this amply disclosed in our briefs, I might add before passing on, there's been information that these regulations may not be binding and the companies perhaps ought not to abide by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.416" offset="14729070">That affects us because we did our best to protect ourselves against them in 1948 in the litigation I spoke of that's mentioned on our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.994" offset="14759372">Now, we consider they are an entirely valid exercise statutory authority and we're persuaded that the discriminations eliminated had been wisely eliminated by the type of regulation that is now enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.482" offset="14813288">But, I call on Your Honors' attention that one of the amicus briefs said that the Mobile case has held it widely, these regulations are invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.279" offset="14856443">Hence, that we're contracting in a wholly invalid form which has been imposed upon us for the last 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.035" offset="14883506">And that counsel for one of the respondents in arguing to the Commission below said the same thing at page 1767 of the oral argument which is part of the record or on that printed record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.568" offset="14937631">He said, “Now, it is our strong contention that Section 154, there are parts of it that are not valid under the Mobile decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.580" offset="14969710">As everybody knows, the Commission was under the impression that the law was different at the time these regulations were put into effect and although they have the force of law, of course they cannot have a force of law if they are in violation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.456" offset="15029164">This type of contract Your Honors is a well known and long standing form as we see it for the determination and redetermination of price by an external standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.196" offset="15096142">We've cited cases in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.943" offset="15115160">They've been cited in the number of briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.246" offset="15124355">Our adversaries have closely examined them and the best theory say is that true the rule for the determination of price by an external standard exists, but this is not a case for the application of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.722" offset="15190288">Now, we say it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.408" offset="15196975">We say that this is a perfect case for the application of that well established principle for the reason that we have here a standard erected of just and reasonable erected by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.494" offset="15269386">We have through an initiation of price change by the seller but an initiation addressed to an entire class so there's no choice of person or discrimination against anyone, that's attested here by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.033" offset="15327483">And procedures laid down in Section 4 which puts the eventual price beyond the control of the seller and subject to the influence of the buyer who wishes to comment and argue justness and reasonableness which is the statutory standard and that I ask you, is it to the essence of the contract of this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3827.453" offset="15413164">What utility can there be?</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.650" offset="15421942">In time I had, so our customers who know the most about our rates in their business by consensual acceptance of a stipulated figure so that they cannot contest the justness and reasonableness of the rates in the Commission for the public's benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.446" offset="15489128">Or, if they cannot withstand in their ascent to the particular rate, the court below held they have to do, they can come in and contest the justness and reasonableness, what does the ascent mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="3858.406" offset="15536985">It seems to me a useless time wasting and expensive formality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3863.745" offset="15558301">If I may call Your Honors' attention to the fact that the case is not cited in our brief has well considered this point in the New York Court of Appeals last year, the Bethlehem Steel case at 2 New York Second 46 456-460 where the court sustained a contract of sale by the Bethlehem Company allowing changes of price by in accordance with increases or decreases in regular prices to all purchasers of plain steel products and the Court said, that did not give the seller undue power of determination of the contract clause citing two of the cases in the Circuit Courts of Appeals on which we have relied.</text>

            <text syncTime="3968.754" offset="15978350">Now, I have said to Your Honors that we had difficulty with this tariff system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3975.627" offset="16005831">We first tendered a form of tariff, General Terms and Conditions and service agreement in May 1952 which was rejected by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3992.047" offset="16071555">There are ensued correspondents between us and the Commission at pages 283-289 of the record concerning that rejection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4004.061" offset="16119620">As a result of the correspondence and with anxiety to get our rates filed because we were the last to file, we eliminated from the General Terms and Conditions of our tariff certain language which our adversaries say is essential to a change of rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4029.410" offset="16220975">We retained, however, that language is at page 289, we retained, however, the language that I'm talking about any effective superseding rate schedules.</text>
            <text syncTime="4044.793" offset="16282520">Now, our adversaries says, “if at the time you found your tariff, you have both the language now in the agreement and this additional language which talks about a change in price in view of an increase in cost and if you then took out the additional language upon objection, must it not be (a), that you thought the additional language was needed to give you flexibility of rate and (b) that you're taking it out to price of your flexibility.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4071.019" offset="16387427">And to that, we say not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4073.371" offset="16396831">We say, the elimination of the language was due to the fact that it was deemed by the Commission to be an automatic rate escalation of power of increase without control.</text>
            <text syncTime="4091.649" offset="16469974">We say that because that is what -- those are words contained in the clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4099.139" offset="16499963">In the event, an increase in seller's cost and so on seller shall have the right to revise its rate to reflect such change and we say that additionally because our adversaries in opposing the certiorari so construe the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="4124.774" offset="16602467">They said in their brief which we have quoted at our -- page 15 of their brief, the Commission objected to the quoted provision as an attempt by United to reserve the right to change the rates automatically contrary to the Commission's regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4143.223" offset="16676237">Now, we, as I've attempted to say as a result of accepting this tariff abandoned the idea of changing rates automatically and since the Commission, and Commission and counsel here construed the objected language as affecting an automatic change, we then took it out and relied upon the -- or any effective superseding rate schedule language as giving as the change by filing and Commission action upon the justification by cost and fair return.</text>
            <text syncTime="4176.099" offset="16807790">Now, I thought it right Your Honors to call your attention in connection with the administrative interpretation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4182.669" offset="16834017">The fact that one of our adversaries was then on the staff Commission, who drafted that language because he is the one or who has signed the brief which says that it was an automatic escalation and an argument before the Commission on this issue he said at page 1639, Commissioner (Inaudible) will recall it was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="4204.431" offset="16921057">The staff had objected to certain provisions including that one about seller shall have the right to revise its rates to reflect such a change.</text>
            <text syncTime="4213.152" offset="16955956">The staff thought that was a proposal by United to automatically change the rates without paying any attention to the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4221.440" offset="16989184">Then he went on to say -- nonetheless, as he was saying today – tomorrow, nonetheless, we argue from other language here, an admission by United Gas Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4233.191" offset="17036100">Now, my submission to Your Honors is under the well settled rules of administrative interpretation, the Commission who promulgated the tariff, who received the new filing who have -- have continually permitted the advocation of the existing language as we claim it should be applied, is the Commission who heard that argument from a former member of their staff who handled the correspondence and having heard it determined in passages of the record which are now in our brief that I will not take the time the read, determine the intent of the parties was an intent for flexible change.</text>
            <text syncTime="4269.135" offset="17179878">We are in the same position I think that as all the other pipeline companies and gas companies whose existing rates and whose pending increases in many million are affected will be affected by Your Honor's decision of this appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="4313.073" offset="17355630">The Court of Appeals sustained the position which Memphis brought up to it on the ground that United's rates -- United's service agreement as interpreted by United and the Commission in this case failed to validate the filings which United made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4337.395" offset="17452910">In other words, the Court of Appeals below held that assuming that United's service agreements meant just exactly what United and the Commission said that they meant, still the -- which was an agreement upon a rate changing procedure, still the Federal Power Commission had no jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act as interpreted in the Mobile Case to accept such a filing of a proposed change in rate and to consider that filing and to grant any increase on the strength of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="4417.112" offset="17771813">The Court of Appeals did not reach that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4419.409" offset="17781008">The Court of Appeals said, assuming that it is what they say it is, we still find that there was no jurisdiction in the Commission but we feel that the -- as a -- as an alternate ground in support of the Court's decision below, if it had gotten to that question, it would no doubt have found that United's -- the pipelines and the Commission's interpretation's was incorrect.</text>

            <text syncTime="4579.347" offset="18420799">The respondents are the Memphis White Gas and Water Division, a distributor of gas which purchases gas from Texas Gas and therefore indirectly from United.</text>
            <text syncTime="4589.822" offset="18462699">And of course, the City of Memphis which appears as representative of its gas consuming public and the Mississippi Valley Gas Company which is a distributor in Jackson, Mississippi and which buys gas from all three of the pipelines involved in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4607.640" offset="18533961">I'd like to also recommend Your Honor's attention, the rendered amicus brief filed on behalf of the Public Service Commission in the State of California are supporting our position and also the Attorney General of Washington, the Attorney General of Wisconsin, the Attorney General of Tennessee, the Attorney General of Mississippi, National Association -- National Institute -- Municipal League Offices and the city of Edinburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="4635.741" offset="18646288">I'd like to get down to the facts in this case as they appear on the record of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4645.225" offset="18684322">United Gas Pipeline on September 30th, 1955 filed with the Federal Power Commission an increase -- schedules of increased rates which purported to increase their rates by a total of -- a jurisdictional rate by a total of approximately $10 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="4664.431" offset="18761122">At the time United filed this filing with the Federal Power Commission, there was not a single one of its customers who even knew what the new rates were going to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="4673.858" offset="18798843">There was no customer of United which had given its consent or agreement to the rates which United filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4681.175" offset="18828100">And to this good day, there is not one single customer of United that has consented or agreed to the rates filed by United in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4693.622" offset="18877837">There is no consensual agreement whatsoever between United and any of its customers, no agreement to pay the rates which United filed and that is admitted by all parties to this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4707.784" offset="18934471">Now, what -- if -- if there is no consent to the new rates, then what -- where does United get its right to file?</text>
            <text syncTime="4715.607" offset="18965817">Well, it gets it from its contracts or purports to -- and particularly, from the effective superseding rate schedules language contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4725.984" offset="19007300">Now, I'd like to by way of a word of caution, I am assuming now for the purpose of my argument as the Court of Appeals did, that the effective superseding rates schedules provision contain all of the worlds of meaning which has been poured into it by United and the pipe -- other pipelines by implication and inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="4746.781" offset="19090474">We don't, for one minute agreed that this is the correct interpretation.</text>

            <text syncTime="4802.058" offset="19311574">It's on the record on 153 and 154.</text>
            <text syncTime="4806.424" offset="19329024">Here's what United told the Federal Power Commission was the meaning and intent of the words effective superseding rights schedule of the agreement (Inaudible) schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4816.579" offset="19369671">It was any of the intent and meaning of such language and were so understood by the parties that such provision contemplated freedom and right by United to sell the file with Federal Power Commission pursuant to Section 4 (d) of the Act, notice the change in rates with consequent freedom and right in Mississippi Valley, Texas Gas, Southern Natural and all of the similarly situated to oppose and contest both the propriety and the lawfulness of the notice changed in rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4850.104" offset="19503835">Notice Your Honors that the right to oppose and contest was consequent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4855.763" offset="19526405">It was a correlative contract right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4859.489" offset="19541347">United goes on the say in another paragraph, “Thus, there was mutual understanding and agreement that effective rates and offending tariff was subject to notice of change filed with the Commission, skipping, followed by full right to oppose and contest such change or review with the effective tariff rates superseded by such things in tariff rates as became effective pursuant to Commission review and determination of the contest, if any, of the propriety and lawfulness of the notice change.</text>
            <text syncTime="4894.722" offset="19682304">Now, Texas Gas was in such complete agreement with United at that stage in the proceedings that it simply adopted United's language, verbatim as its own interpretation of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4908.153" offset="19736012">United went on with specific reference to its contract with Mississippi Valley and -- and on page 26, we see where they again emphasized that the purchaser under the contract, the purchaser was free to oppose and contest any noticed change.</text>
            <text syncTime="4926.941" offset="19811140">Southern Natural, United of a customer wanted to the same kind of service agreement was of the same opinion in the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4934.252" offset="19840397">You can see at the page 27 of our brief where Southern Natural says that the effective superseding rates schedule provision right grants to United the right to file with the Commission under the provisions of Section 4 (d) changes in rates schedules under which Southern purchases natural gas subject of course to Southern's right to oppose any such change rates in the proceeding before the Commission in respect thereto initiated under the Section 4 (e) and 5 (a) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4963.464" offset="19957217">Now, all of the statements by the pipelines involved United's about its own contract contained three particular points.</text>
            <text syncTime="4971.948" offset="19991176">It's a sort of three-point arrangement.</text>

            <text syncTime="5255.638" offset="21125935">Let me get back to this business of just exactly what kind of a preacher this contract between the parties was.</text>
            <text syncTime="5264.495" offset="21161357">It was an arbitration proceeding and Southern Natural, one of the parties to the contract conceded and stated to the Federal Power Commission that this was an arbitration procedure used just those words.</text>
            <text syncTime="5279.492" offset="21221334">It says that there's no reason in the law or in common sense while a natural gas company may not lawfully agree that the right specified in the contract maybe submitted to arbitration by either of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5293.335" offset="21276714">And it went on to say, that is exactly what has been done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5300.457" offset="21305240">So the contracts, it went on to say clearly contemplate that the seller may submit of the Commission on the Section 4 (d) changes in rates with the Commission acting as the arbitrator between the parties under its powers granted by Section 4 (d) and 4 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="5317.327" offset="21372635">Now, I might say that ever since that's done, Southern Natural and Texas Gas have been backing away from that term arbitration from the recognition that all this was on agreement to an arbitration procedure and they have finally come to full circle and in their briefs now, they spend several pages to explain why it couldn't possibly be an arbitration procedure, but I submit to Your Honors that this is the record in the clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5345.699" offset="21486216">This is the record upon in which the Commission made its decision and it is the record upon which this Court of course must make its decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="5361.892" offset="21550895">Incidentally, the Commissions conceived the issue in this case as primarily an issue of contract construction as to what the contracts mean.</text>

            <text syncTime="5514.134" offset="22159862">As I understand the opinion, Your Honor went in to a very full analysis of Section 4 of the Natural Gas Act and showed that United could not do what it wanted to do there because it was attempting to use Section 4 as a rate changing procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5534.787" offset="22242513">And the Natural Gas Act provided no rate changing procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5540.781" offset="22266546">And therefore, there was -- and furthermore, that the review of power of the Commission was the sole power over rates that the Commission had, not the power to participate in the rate changing process between the companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5558.887" offset="22338957">To get back to the Commission's filing -- the Commission's finding in this case, the Commission recognized, so clearly recognized that this was a proposal that it use the word proposal four times in the course of its opinion in referring to United's proposed rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5578.582" offset="22417742">Thus, as we show at page 28 of our brief, the changes contemplated by the agreements than the Commission were unilateral changes to be proposed by United and in the last sentence of the opinion it wound up, United's proposal for increase rate in this proceeding does not constitute a prohibited unilateral change of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5604.714" offset="22522232">So, the Commission clearly recognized that United's filing was nothing, but a proposal as it had to be if it was an arbitration proceeding and the customers have the same right to oppose a right correlative and co-equal to rights of (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="5621.953" offset="22591195">So, from there, the case went up to the Court of Appeals and that the Court of Appeals defining was made just exactly as United and the Commission argued their rates was that all they had agreed upon was the right file, in other words, the right to make the arbitration proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5643.018" offset="22675414">And then after a careful review of this Court's opinion in Mobile, the Court of Appeals held that on agreement upon the right to make the proposal which did not take the rates out of the realm of controversy between the parties, but attempted to drag the Federal Power Commission down into the rate controversy between the two utilities, that that sort of an agreement simply was not sufficient to make these rates subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="5677.883" offset="22814908">The Federal Power Commission said the Mobile opinion does not work on proposals.</text>
