            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Mr. Elman, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Philip Elman</label>
            <text syncTime="9.349" offset="140727">Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.751" offset="154415">While I should like to devote the rest of time to the decree, I feel I should say just a few words on the relevant marketpoint in view of the importance which appellants attached to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.377" offset="224841">There again, there is no disagreement as to the legal standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.776" offset="250441">Both sides accepted the standard of law that was expressed in the du Pont cellophane case.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.898" offset="287013">The complaint in this case alleged that the heart of trade or commerce which was involved here was the promotion of world's championship boxing contests.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.924" offset="335078">The District Court found on the facts that there was a special, unique and distinct market as to championship contest that ultimate findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.429" offset="393070">In fact is supported by numerous supporting findings as to the greater commercial appeal of championship fights for spectators.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.299" offset="468616">There's a finding that championship fights generated three times the television, motion picture and radio revenue and five times the box office revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.476" offset="521279">During the four-year period of the conspiracy, there were some 44,000 fights throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.609" offset="545834">Only 44 of those, one-tenth of 1% were championship fights and yet that small fraction produced one-third of the total gross revenue of all boxing.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.106" offset="595780">The -- there was testimony by television sponsors and their advertising agency executives.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.139" offset="623888">There's testimony by the former chairman of the National Boxing Association, Mr. Abe Greene, that a championship fight, a fight is -- is entirely different from the ordinary fight where two men are fighting each other and when a champ -- when the championship for the world is involved, when the winner of the fight is officially proclaimed by a government agency that he is the champion of the world and can defeat any man his size and weight in the whole world, somehow that invests the contest with a quality that the Court can take judicial notice of.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.687" offset="802147">It's -- the same phenomenon occurs every year, the first week in October when the World Series in baseball was played.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.217" offset="844257">People who aren't interested in baseball during the season, for some reason become excited about the World Series because a championship is involved, and that has tremendous commercial implications.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.563" offset="901622">The television sponsors, well, one of them the Pabst Brewing Company paid $200,000 for the right to televise the Joe Louis-Ezzard Charles fight.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.449" offset="945194">It paid the motion -- for the motion picture rights $100,000 for championship fight.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.745" offset="966301">There was no market at all for the motion picture rights for the non-championship fights.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.924" offset="987094">Now, you have all these findings as to the nature of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.216" offset="1012276">You have findings as to the vast differences, the amount of money that was produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.689" offset="1038085">And perhaps, more significant than anything else, the defendants themselves recognized that distinction because they concentrated their activities in the championship field.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.633" offset="1077896">As to the -- as to the aspects of the conspiracy, of course, they're engaged in the promotion of non-championship fights, but the arrangements between themselves, the -- the agreement to split the profits between the Illinois and the New York group was at -- were only at the championship fights.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.856" offset="1150830">The -- these exclusive contracts which they entered into with contenders were not -- were not applicable in case the -- the contender lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.081" offset="1199731">They -- they were concerned only about his winning.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.876" offset="1206836">They wanted to make sure that he became the champion then they'd have the exclusive promotional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.795" offset="1226585">And similarly, the territorial allocation as to where the fights would be -- would be held, that applied only to championship fights.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.357" offset="1260753">Now, on the basis of all that, we -- we find it very difficult to see any basis on which the finding of fact, and it's a factual question, can be set aside as clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.258" offset="1308400">And I shall therefore pass on immediately to the -- to the relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.646" offset="1334000">Now, the District Court had, as I say, in March of 1956, entered his findings of fact as to the violations of law, the restraints of trade, the monopoly and the monopolistic power that exclude competitors which the defendants enjoy.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.838" offset="1446745">Proposed -- proposed forms of final judgment were submitted by the parties in April of 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.586" offset="1481749">The Government and the defendants submitted their -- their proposals, the defendants requested a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.189" offset="1512155">And I -- I misspoke myself before the lunch recess, I -- I said there were 9000 pages, that was a slip of the tongue, it was 900 pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.647" offset="1553951">The hearings covered a period of nine trial days and the purpose of the hearings, which the Court expressly stated and I think I should refer to -- to that in view of General Royall's observation that -- that the District Judge disregarded the existing conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.753" offset="1662412">If Your Honors will look at pages 769 and 774 of the record, you will find Judge Ryan saying why he was having these hearings on the relief that he wanted to go into all the existing conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.215" offset="1716224">He wanted to know what the defendants and the Government had to say as to the fairness and the reasonableness and the feasibility of the proposals for -- for the relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.688" offset="1758124">Now, as I mentioned earlier, the practice he followed was not of reserving judgment until the last day.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.250" offset="1800338">He expressed his mind openly as he went along and he changed his mind as he went along in the light of -- of his preoccupation with the case and his being immersed in -- in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.943" offset="1859166">And what finally emerged, as I also said, was a judgment which was not proposed in toto by either side.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.478" offset="1901275">It was a composite.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.110" offset="1907858">Parts came from the Government, parts came from the defendant, part defendants and part -- one significant part, the compulsory leasing part initiated with the judge was adopted by the defense and that's in -- in the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.852" offset="1970761">Let me refer to the opinion which he delivered from the bench on June 24th, 1957, which is in the record, starting at page 891 in Volume 2 in which he explains why the relief that he grants is necessary and -- and proper in view of the findings and the evidence that he had -- had presented to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.641" offset="2133974">He states, at the bottom of page 891, that the conspiracy which he found to be existing was made effective by the concert of action of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.782" offset="2182457">The combination was the source of the monopolistic power which they had acquired and exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.440" offset="2229164">He said, at page 891, what he had earlier said through -- in the course of the hearings that there must be a dissolution of that combination in order to reestablish the competitive conditions which existed in 1949 before the combination was established and to permit the entry of others into the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.825" offset="2318712">That was the core of the case as it appeared to Judge Ryan.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.058" offset="2335640">It was the fact that Norris and Wirtz who had been in Chicago would, as a practical matter, have been outside of the -- of the Garden boxing picture in 1949, who had held only 10% of the stock in the Garden and who had not exercised any control or participating in its management, who had been directors or officers in Norris and Wirtz by reason of this combination had become directors of the Garden.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.177" offset="2444100">Norris became the president of the - of the Madison Square Garden Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.954" offset="2463222">They increased their stockholdings from 50,000 shares prior to 1949 to well over 200,000 shares in 1955, a 38% stock interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.020" offset="2519437">There was no question that Norris and Wirtz, during the period of this conspiracy, had acquired control of the -- of the Garden Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.586" offset="2557680">That they were now directors of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.216" offset="2572204">And Norris, as I say, was -- had become the leading spirit in -- in the group.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.774" offset="2598431">And what had seemed to Judge Ryan to be absolutely essential was to get Norris and Wirtz out of the Garden picture to try to get the situation if it could possibly be done back to where it'd been in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.221" offset="2660289">He also wanted -- he wanted the decree to encourage others to come into the picture, other independents to undertake, to compete, if they could with -- with the Garden and with Norris and Wirtz.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.435" offset="2737089">He rejected the suggestion which came almost on the eve of the decree that the Garden give up championship, give up boxing entirely because from the judge's point of view that would have eliminated the most important potential independent promoter of boxing.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.568" offset="2817651">There was the Garden, the big -- the big factor in the boxing picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.621" offset="2845863">And to remove it from -- from boxing would leave Norris and Wirtz still in -- still in the -- in the scene and the Garden would be out.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.108" offset="2887764">And -- and from Judge Ryan's point of view, he wanted to keep the Garden in the business, not exclude it from the business, but he wanted to have the Garden remain in -- in boxing free from the control which Norris and Wirtz had acquired during the period of this conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.839" offset="2974699">And that's the main thing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.449" offset="2985148">And he -- and I could give Your Honors record references to the places throughout the hearings on the relief where Judge Ryan says again and again, “What I'm trying to do is to get Norris and Wirtz back to Chicago, get the situation back to where it was in 1949, break up this combination.”</text>
            <text syncTime="740.852" offset="3066755">And all the provisions of the decree have to be examined as against that central purpose.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="750.392" offset="3104893">But wouldn't that central purpose be satisfied and mitigated by making conditions as to the non-monopolistic use of the Garden rather than also requiring them to get out of the Garden?</text>
