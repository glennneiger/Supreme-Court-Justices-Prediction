            <text syncTime="14.593" offset="161729">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.799" offset="170611">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.627" offset="177925">This is an antitrust suit for damages against the RKO and Loew Motion Pictures theatre circuits in New York City, arising out of the monopolization in that city of the first neighborhood run by those two circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.686" offset="242082">The petitioners here are four associated companies formally engaged in the independent distribution and production of motion pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.709" offset="282206">They produced those pictures during most of the period of time involved here under the name Eagle Lion and I shall refer them hereafter as Eagle Lion.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.249" offset="316374">The damage period involved are the -- is the four playing seasons 46 to 47 through 49 to 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.984" offset="355349">In the District Court, the petitioners relied primarily upon the case of the United States v. Paramount Pictures, et al. to establish a prima facie case of conspiracy on behalf of the RKO and Loew's circuits to exclude independent distributors like ourselves of access -- competitive access to the first neighborhood run market in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.459" offset="445210">We were, of course, relying upon Section 5 of the Clayton Act which makes a prior judgment on behalf of the United States admissible as prima facie evidence in behalf of a private claimant as to those matters as to which there is an estoppel between the Government and the defendants in the prior case.</text>

            <text syncTime="107.768" offset="534444">No, Your Honor, the case was tried in the District Court without a jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="113.607" offset="557850">Both side with an evidence?</text>

          <turn speaker="william_l_mcgovern" startTime="115.144" stopTime="503.421">
            <label>Mr. William L. McGovern</label>
            <text syncTime="115.144" offset="563911">Both side with an evidence as the full record here.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.064" offset="575613">Both lower courts held that the Paramount judgment was no evidence in this case of any conspiracy against independent distributors.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.130" offset="615842">Both courts below held that if the Paramount case was evidence of any conspiracy at all, it was evidence only of a conspiracy against independent exhibitors as distinct from independent distributors and that therefore it established no conspiracy at all as to ourselves, independent distributors.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.895" offset="698911">I should like just for a moment before coming to the Paramount judgment itself point out to the Court that the market that we're talking about here, the first neighborhood run market in New York is the most important single market for motion pictures in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.888" offset="762964">From this tremendous concentration of population located on Manhattan Island in the Metropolitan area generally, a motion picture distributor will ordinarily derive from 9% to 11% of its total national domestic gross and a percentage that large is more often than not the margin between successful and unsuccessful distribution of a motion picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.644" offset="865991">Curiously enough, the New York -- the entire New York market is a market of very strange contrasts.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.622" offset="893889">As the members of the Court may know, there are concentrated up on Broadway in midtown Manhattan, all substantially fall of the so-called first run New York houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.358" offset="936835">The showcases on Broadway while the -- the major defendants in the Paramount case had some affiliated theatres on Broadway.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.311" offset="972570">By and large, they were 35 to 40 independently operated theatres on Broadway.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.691" offset="994095">And the plaintiffs here were able to get competitive access to that first New York run in Broadway without difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.904" offset="1023039">The record shows that insofar as we have comparable classes of pictures getting access to first run in New York that our pictures outgrew theirs slightly.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.349" offset="1064730">We took -- as I recall, we took .028 of our national gross out of that first New York run on Broadway as against .025 for the major distributors affiliated with the defendants in the Paramount case.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.492" offset="1125334">But as you came off, first New York run on Broadway and began to approach the circuits where the great mass of the consuming public in New York in this industry are located, you ran into this blockade by these two circuits, the RKO and Loew's circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.740" offset="1194297">These two circuits together comprise approximately 100 theatres and these were not only the theatres that enjoyed the first and second neighborhood run clearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.778" offset="1242467">But they were also the most strategically located theatres in terms of the population that they served.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.243" offset="1272351">Access to those two circuits was critically important to a distributor in the New York area for another reason, because of the fact that they have control of the first and second neighborhood runs, all of the subsequent runs in New York played off the two preceding circuit runs, second and first, on the RKO and Loew circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.752" offset="1358346">And the result of that was that all of the subsequent run house is getting on down to the third, fourth of the tag-ins down below.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.264" offset="1396381">All had developed the pattern, the industry pattern of taking their bills off the prior weekly bills on the RKO and Loew circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.632" offset="1433893">The result of that, if the Court please, was that in New York where you have in the entire neighborhood run area, everything at the first Broadway, you have about 600 theatre availabilities all told of which only 100 are concentrated in the two circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.041" offset="1499512">The result of this playoff system was that unless you've got in up on top in either the RKO or the Loew circuit, you are blocked out not only from the 100 theatres comprising the two circuits but you were indeed blocked out from all of the subsequent run theatres in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.909" offset="1558967">In short, if you get in the circuits, you were to sent blocked in the 600 houses right down the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.662" offset="1577984">If you are excluded from the circuits, you were out of about 600 houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.666" offset="1602017">The result was -- is -- is apparent in the record that the two circuits constituted a very serious bottleneck confronting any distributor who came in New York, instead of having 600 available buyers that only might go for the competitive selection of these pictures on a give-and-take basis based upon quality and play date and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.391" offset="1684982">Where an independent like ourself came to New York, we had two choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.665" offset="1702013">We could go to the RKO booking office and try to book the RKO circuit in which case would made RKO and all the theatres following thereafter or we could go to the Loew booking office and try to book the Loew circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.012" offset="1751437">And if we got in, good, and if we didn't, we were out.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.405" offset="1765021">In short, what you had here was really two buyers and this critically important neighborhood run market in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.737" offset="1798353">Now, it wasn't recognition of that kind of circuit buying power and the power of the circuit to exclude independents, both distributors and exhibitors that the three-judge court in the Paramount case found that the conspiracy that was castigated there operated both on independent distributors and independent exhibitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.166" offset="1903992">Those findings of the Court with respect to the independent distributors as well as the exhibitors are set forth in our brief at pages 9 and 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.411" offset="1937011">And I will not go into them in detail here.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.923" offset="1947042">Suffice it to say that on the basis of those findings, the three-judge court in the Paramount case concluded the -- in conclusion number nine which is set forth in the record at 643, concluded as follows and I quote, “The exhibitor-defendant Loew's Inc., Warner Brothers Pictures, Warner Brothers Circuit Management Corporation, Twentieth Century-Fox et al, all of the majors, have unreasonably restrained trade and commerce in the distribution and exhibition of motion pictures.”</text>
            <text syncTime="491.981" offset="2071280">And I emphasize, Your Honor, merely because of the nature of the decisions below, “restrained trading commerce in the distribution and exhibition of motion pictures”.</text>

            <text syncTime="526.368" offset="2208893">I might just stop a moment to trace the history there.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.317" offset="2220596">You had a three-judge expediting court convened by the -- by the Government to try the case to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.744" offset="2238360">That court first handed out its decision in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.114" offset="2251839">That decision was reversed in part, affirmed in part by this Court reversed particularly with those aspects looking toward the (Inaudible) relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.811" offset="2282663">The case then went back.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.930" offset="2287052">There were hearings on remand in New York by the three-judge court in 1948 and the final decision came out in October of 1949 and the final judgment which we -- which is now before us, we printed it up in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.466" offset="2337207">The final judgment appeared in February of 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.971" offset="2359254">Now, the defendants make a -- still make a half-hearted contention in this Court, I believe, that the Paramount case is applicable only to exhibitors and does not affect distributors.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.948" offset="2407215">I suggest however that we have reached this point here thoroughly.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.703" offset="2422157">I merely wish to emphasize before I leave it that the Paramount case in so many words, we needn't argue implicitly, explicitly on the face of the judgment repeatedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.270" offset="2472417">The three-judge court in Paramount found a discrimination and a monopolization against independent distributors as well as independent exhibitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.480" offset="2513272">And I should like also, Your Honors, to emphasize this point, that when the Court in Paramount is referring to the operation of the conspiracy there upon independent distributors, they are referring to the petitioners here among others because at the time of the trial of that case, they were only three independent distributors in the country, Eagle Lion, Monogram and Republic.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.067" offset="2603656">And we appeared in both the original case and on the hearings on remand in 1948, Eagle Lion appeared as a witness for the Government and gave testimony in behalf of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.369" offset="2640854">There are findings of fact in that judgment referring to the revenues received by Eagle Lion as well as the other independent distributors.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.614" offset="2669798">And so I emphasize that not only do you have in the Paramount case findings referring to independent distributors as a group but you have findings that, I think, at all experience, must be construed as referring to these petitioners here to Eagle Lion because we were one of the parties before the Court in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.981" offset="2743254">So much for the national conspiracy and the findings relating to it found in the Paramount case.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.473" offset="2773243">Coming down to this very market here this New York subsequent run market, the Court in Paramount in its final judgment in 1950 made this finding, Finding 154 (d) which I think is critical to the disposition of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.852" offset="2838758">That appears on the record at pages 636 to 637.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.248" offset="2860387">Finding 154 (d) reads, “In New York City, Loew and RKO divided the neighborhood prior run product of the various dependent distributors under a continuing arrangement so that there was no competition between them in obtaining pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.237" offset="2932276">On one occasion where Paramount was having a long dispute with Loew's as to rental terms for Paramount Films to be shown in Loew's New York neighborhood circuit of theatres, no attempt was made by Paramount to lease its films to RKO for exhibition in the latter circuit nor was any effort made by RKO to procure Paramount Films as they both evidently preferred to adhere to the existing arrangement under which Loew's circuit consistently exhibited the films of itself, Paramount, United Artist, Columbia and half of Universal while RKO exhibited the films of itself, Fox, Warner and one half of Universal.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.885" offset="3078875">In other words, they carry the split to the point where they took the Universal product and cut it in half and each of them took half of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.867" offset="3106879">And on the basis of that finding, the Court in Paramount made this conclusion, Conclusion 16 which appears in the record of page 644.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.636" offset="3141883">“Loew's Incorporated has violated the Sherman Act by conspiring with RKO to monopolize and monopolizing the first neighborhood run in New York City and by the dividing of that market between itself and RKO.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.586" offset="3213667">Now, I point out to the Court that there are two findings which have particular focus on the very market we're dealing with in this lawsuit, the first neighborhood run in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.681" offset="3258075">You have a finding that the defendants have so organized that market by controlling the theatres and the division of the product of the other major distributors, that there is no competition between them in procuring films.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.553" offset="3317635">We have a conclusion that they have violated the Sherman Act by monopolizing that market and by dividing the market between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.846" offset="3358804">Now, I wish to point out again, if the Court please, that those two findings appeared for the first time in the judgment in February 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.313" offset="3400600">In other words, they were based partially upon the hearings on remand in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.969" offset="3423274">They did not appear in the original judgment in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.566" offset="3441664">The judgment entered in 1950, however, pointed out that it was made as of 1945 because that was the time most of the testimony in the record had been received.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.704" offset="3486177">However, Finding 158 in the 1950 judgment contains this finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.971" offset="3519300">Evidence submitted since the remand of this case has been considered by this Court.</text>
