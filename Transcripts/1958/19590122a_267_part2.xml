            <text syncTime="214.580" offset="961703">Your -- you allege in these briefs then, do you, that you were a voluntary coconspirator?</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph W. Louisell</label>
            <text syncTime="221.198" offset="988139">We were a voluntary coconspirator in pari delicto and each of them was similarly so situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.263" offset="1028472">Now, that brings us, we believe, squarely to the proposition as to whether or not it is the -- the rule of law as pronounced by this Court that one who is a voluntary participant in pari delicto with others can repudiate a contract and successfully defend against a suit for the purchase price of the article where the very contract or the undertaking which is sought to be enforced is simultaneously the undertaking which had, for its subjective, the accomplishment of an illegal purpose, namely, the fixing of prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.175" offset="1236093">We have not labored in the brief, submitted except by reference in a footnote to a number of the decisions of this Court, the proposition that price fixing agreements are per se illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.439" offset="1297115">Very recently, Mr. Chief Justice Warren, in speaking for the Court in United States against McKesson &amp; Robbins, very clearly spelled out that the illegality of any price fixing arrangement does not depend upon whether the arrangement was unreasonable or reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.348" offset="1376737">It does not depend on the motive of the parties whether good or evil.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.096" offset="1395754">It doesn't depend on whether the price fixed is accomplished by contract or as in this instance, by some more subtle device, namely, the withholding of this large quantity of onions from the market or whether the participants possess market control or the extent of control effected by the price fixing arrangement or whether the agreement is effective or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.714" offset="1498258">I think it too well settled and too late in the day for anyone seriously to challenge the proposition announced by this Court on enumerable occasions that price fixing agreements are illegal per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.072" offset="1551653">And that any undertaking calculated to affect a price fix is per se illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.535" offset="1577462">And that stems from the inherent policy underlying Sections 1 to 7 of the Sherman Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="383.565" offset="1637648">It was decided on the motion to strike this affirmative answer that this contract was per se an illegal contract because it constituted an entire undertaking by the parties to attempt to fix and manipulate prices.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph W. Louisell</label>
            <text syncTime="399.995" offset="1703372">No, they do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.499" offset="1713403">And that that we respectfully submit brought into focus an issue of fact which should properly have been tried because the opponents did file an answer in addition to the motion to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.949" offset="1767215">But we never got to the answer because the motion to strike was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.888" offset="1790934">Now, it is our belief that we are not here concerned primarily with the character of the litigants whether the litigants are good, bad or indifferent.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.611" offset="1845791">Now, we respectfully submit, it's beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.373" offset="1856867">What we are concerned with here is whether or not the character of the contract -- of the entire contract, not just the portion taken out of context by the plaintiff but whether or not the character of the entire contract which the defendant by his pleading offered to show was or was not illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.112" offset="1955819">And perhaps, our consideration with that -- of that proposition begins with a reference first to the Connolly-Sewer Pipe case decided in 1902 by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.331" offset="2012662">The Connolly case was an action in one instance commenced on promissory notes given by the purchaser of Sewer Pipe as consideration for that purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.626" offset="2077863">And in the consolidated action, a second suit brought by the pipe manufacturer against a man by the name of Dee in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.531" offset="2117465">It was on an open account for pipe sold to Mr. Dee.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.864" offset="2138781">And there, Connolly and Dee defended or sought to defend the suit on the claim that the seller itself was engaged in a conspiracy in restraint of trade in violation of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.319" offset="2220596">The summon substance of the decision of this Court was that in as much as there was no claim that the contract of purchase between Connolly and the Sewer Pipe Company and between Dee and the Sewer Pipe Company was a contract in restraint of trade that the defense of violation of the Sherman Act was not available to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.054" offset="2323623">The Court very carefully pointing out that there was no claim, that there was anything in the contract of sale between the Sewer Pipe Company and its two customers that was in anyway suggestive of a violation of the Sherman Act, that what those defendants there relied upon was the antecedent claimed illegality of the manufacturer of the sewer pipe entering into a combination with other manufacturers but in no way related to these customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.870" offset="2466879">And the Court said that under those circumstances because the illegality alleged by the customers was not inherent in the contract upon which suit was bought, the defense could not be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.677" offset="2534066">Two months later, this Court in 1902, in May of 1902, decided the Beeman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.746" offset="2574399">Now, without making any reference to its decision in the Connolly case, in the Beeman case, this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Peckham, I believe, said, “We are of the opinion that anyone sued upon a contract may set up a defense that it is in violation of the Sherman Act,” and it found to be so that fact will constitute a good defense to the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.257" offset="2704384">And further in the opinion, the Court's in but that that does not prevent a private individual when sued upon a contract which is void as in violation of the Act from setting it up as a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.116" offset="2755793">And we think when proved, it is a valid defense to any claim made under a contract thus denounced as illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.390" offset="2796962">Some seven years later, in 1909, this Court met with and dealt with the question, but for the first time in 1909, it was presented on a proposition that the contract sued upon in and of itself was illegal in that that contract, and I refer to the Continental Wall Paper case decided in 1909, in that contract itself, between the seller and the buyer, there were restrictive conditions, which on their face, constituted a violation of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.510" offset="2973445">That too, as in this instant case, was a suit for the recovery of the purchase price of wall paper sold to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.259" offset="3008449">And the defendant there defended upon the proposition that the contract upon which the suit was brought on its face was violative of the Sherman Act and hence, this Court reasoned, since -- in maintaining the suit, the plaintiff had to bring into issue and had to rely upon a contract which was illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.563" offset="3113671">The plaintiff could not maintain its action and the defense asserted that their contract was illegal, was a good, adequate and sufficient defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.871" offset="3158810">Now, just as the respondent here relies a great length upon the rule of the Connolly case, the petitioner here relies a great length upon the rule, as initially stated in the Beeman case and then as approved in Continental Wall Paper case where the exact same result for which the petitioner here contends was achieved by virtue of the decision in the Continental Wall Paper case.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.149" offset="3291930">But the Seventh Circuit in the District Court were of the opinion that the DM Wilder case decided in 1915 either abrogated or modified the rule in the Continental Wall Paper case.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.915" offset="3371029">In analysis of the Wilder case, however, discloses that thereto as in the Connolly case, the customer, the purchaser who sought to avoid the obligation to pay by reliance upon the Sherman Act was not himself a party to an agreement that was inherently illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.798" offset="3474578">He was a stranger to any illegality.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.069" offset="3491610">And it was frankly conceded apparently at the oral argument because a careful reading of the case discloses that it is pointed out that the customer in that situation made no claim that the contract upon which the suit was brought was in itself illegal except when viewed through the eyes of the seller whom it was claimed, was together with other manufacturers of glucose associated in a combination of restraint of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.372" offset="3628910">But there, as in the Connolly case, the illegality of the -- of the plaintiff was no part of the illegality of the contract upon which the suit was brought.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="898.095" offset="3695783">But would the fact that in the Continental case, the complaint alleged that he was compelled to buy at these high fixed prices that they were excessive but if he hadn't -- hadn't paid this price, he wouldn't have received any wall paper at all, is that -- on the fact that those elements are not here, is that any reason to distinguish the two cases?</text>

          <turn speaker="joseph_w_louisell" startTime="929.409" stopTime="1240.116">
            <label>Mr. Joseph W. Louisell</label>
            <text syncTime="929.409" offset="3820962">I don't think that that is the true rationale or the basis of the decision in the Continental case.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.954" offset="3847189">I think that the true basis while that is referred to and that was a factor there present in the Continental case, it appears to us that the true rationale of the Continental case is really but a restatement of the old proposition that the courts will not enforce a contract as to which the parties are in pari delicto and the contract is illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.291" offset="3952515">And that the Court will leave the parties where they found them and will not enforce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.365" offset="3972786">I think that that is the true rationale of the Continental case.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.503" offset="3997341">And I -- I think that we find support for that proposition by reference to the next pronouncement of this Court in 1925 in the Small against Lamborn decision where the Court there expressly approved the tryst proposition stated in the -- restating the Connolly case that the courts will not enforce a contract that is illegal as violative of the Sherman Act where the suit is brought upon that contract but held in the -- in Small against Lamborn that the -- the rule of the Continental case was inapplicable for the reason that there again, as in Wilder and as in Connolly, the illegality did not inhere in the contract upon which the suit was brought but was antecedent to and wholly unrelated to the contract of purchase upon which the suit was brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.609" offset="4249788">And in 1942, this Court again had occasion to review the question, and that was in Sola Electric against Jefferson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.283" offset="4308511">That case, like this one, arose from the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.191" offset="4328155">And Mr. Chief Justice Stone speaking for the unanimous court ruled in this situation that the defense of illegality inherent in the contract by virtue of it being violative of the Sherman Act was a perfectly proper defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.593" offset="4417703">And it arose in this way, the petitioner in the Sola Electric Company case there asserted that by reason of the price control provisions of its licensing arrangement with the Jefferson Manufacturing Company, that the Jefferson Manufacturing Company was not entitled to royalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.156" offset="4519999">It being there, the Sola Electric Company's further claim that this arrangement, this contract was without the immunity from the Sherman Act supported -- available otherwise by a valid patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.492" offset="4585305">In other words, had there been a valid patent, the immunity from the application of the Sherman Act would have been enforced and this question could not have arisen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.442" offset="4633161">But the Sola Electric Company took the position that the patent was not a valid patent and hence a price fixing arrangement contained in the licensing contract was illegal as violative of the Sherman Act and that they should have been allowed to show as they asked by their affirmative pleadings in the suit to -- in the suit to recover royalties that the contract upon which the suit was brought was as to that aspect of it, violative of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.112" offset="4763773">And in reversing the Seventh Circuit and speaking for the unanimous court, Mr. Chief Justice Stone said, “Similarly, this Court has declared that anyone sued upon a contract may set up as a defense that it is in violation of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.507" offset="4841409">And it has proceeded on the assumption that whether the parties to an agreement in violation of the Act are in pari delicto as a question of federal not state law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.525" offset="4893445">It decided the Continental Wall Paper Company -- it decided in Continental Wall Paper Company that a vendee of goods purchased from an illegal combination in pursuance of an illegal agreement both in violation of the Sherman Act can cleave the illegality in defense to a suit for the recovery of the purchase price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.482" offset="4985292">This decision went much farther than is necessary to go here to conclude that petitioner may assert the illegality of the price fixing agreement and may offer any competent evidence to establish its illegality including proof of the invalidity of the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.621" offset="5053837">Now, that was in 1942.</text>

            <text syncTime="1698.382" offset="6896933">One of the aspects of the case that has been argued extensively in the briefs and relied upon by the Seventh Circuit and by the District Court is the so-called “severability” of the obligation here alleged by the plaintiff for the defendant to pay for these onions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2004.806" offset="8122598">Actually, deliveries are very rare.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.139" offset="8135973">The transactions wring themselves out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.844" offset="8146735">And we had cited a study made by the Commodities Exchange Authority that over the last 10 years, there was a very small percentage of the total contracts that were settled by delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.787" offset="8194487">That's the only condition that we concede existed as a part of this sale -- purchased and sale transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.428" offset="8249135">Secondly, this was not a price fixing agreement and there is no basis upon which counsel can so say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.916" offset="8287065">The allegations in his -- in his affirmative answer -- as -- answer an affirmative defense conflict with the fact that a price fixing agreement was here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.123" offset="8327816">There is no per se violation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.440" offset="8341086">The motion to strike that was heard by the District Court was heard on the basis of the facts conceded as they were alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.993" offset="8379329">And the District Court held not only that this defense was not available in a -- in a suit on a contract but also that the claim of illegality was erroneous, that the condition of non-delivery was a reasonable restraint imposed by a purchaser of goods in order to protect his purchasers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.204" offset="8472221">And there are many examples that we can cite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.659" offset="8482043">You buy a business and agreed not to compete for five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.358" offset="8496776">Of course, it's a restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.262" offset="8504404">But it's considered a reasonable part of doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.010" offset="8515375">And this is what the District Court held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.281" offset="8524466">And mind you, while I am now arguing the question of whether or not this condition was illegal, I intended to say to this Court that I would not argue it that it isn't before the Court that counsel asks you to assume that it's illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.513" offset="8593429">And on that basis, determine that the defense was available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.594" offset="8609729">But the District Court has already said that it was not illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.352" offset="8632822">The Court of Appeals infers, they say, “We will not pass upon it but we have our doubts,” the Court of Appeals infers that it was not illegal and counsel has not briefed or argued that point in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.628" offset="8685902">Let me make another correction of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.486" offset="8697292">You were -- one of the Justices asked counsel whether or not all the buyers were notified and all of them repudiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.274" offset="8728430">This is not in the record but it's not important that it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.913" offset="8747029">Actually, many of the buyers did fulfill their contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.135" offset="8775868">And possibly, this is beyond counsel's knowledge because all of the people who repudiated this contract were counsel's clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.641" offset="8821948">And the repudiation came on March 9th as the pleadings established.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.677" offset="8842115">And Mr. Kelly's partner and co-owner of a business filed an affidavit in this proceeding which was considered by the District Court in support of the motions that were presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.806" offset="8894568">And in that affidavit, Mr. Kelly's partner says in March 1956, the time of the repudiation, in March 1956, the prices for cash onions stored in Chicago dropped substantially and difficulties were encountered in the merchandising of such onions due to the arrival in Chicago of fresh Texas onions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.634" offset="8993938">This is a market phenomenon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.415" offset="9001044">And if you will read counsel's answer, you will find that on March 9th when they repudiated the contract, they, for the first time, raised the question not only a violation of the antitrust laws but violation of a multitude of other statutes which they have now abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.630" offset="9069902">Some reference was made by Justice Stewart to the counterclaim, and I think that Justice Douglas took it up, on the misconception that the counterclaim was in effect, damages arising out of this illegal condition that it was in the nature of a travel damage counterclaim, not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.517" offset="9141478">The counterclaim was based on the allegation that we've reached this non-delivery condition that the plaintiff's had agreed not to deliver in the futures market during the futures trading season and that we've reached this agreement and therefore, they suffered damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.406" offset="9229040">This counterclaim was not doubt by the District Court and sustained by the Court of Appeals, and they have abandoned it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.645" offset="9253909">But they have never asked for damages on a travel damage basis or by reason of having been violated of -- injured because of a violation of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.135" offset="9303960">They can't show any such damages, and they haven't.</text>

            <text syncTime="3876.488" offset="15609292">In the patent cases, we contend that there could be no unjust enrichment because the royalties that were denied in the Kiplinger case, not in the Sola, but the royalties that were denied in the Kiplinger case were denied because the patent was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3890.238" offset="15664358">There was no consideration for which to pay royalties.</text>

            <text syncTime="4832.718" offset="19434245">Since this litigation arose, the Congress has abolished it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4838.810" offset="19458591">So there is no futures trading in the onions market anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="4842.626" offset="19473847">And the fact of the matter is that the futures onion market largely, as a matter of economics, controls the cash market price of onions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4854.909" offset="19522957">And hence, a disposition to withdraw and an agreement when a combination in a conspiracy to withdraw and not to deliver a thousand carloads on the futures market would have, as is alleged by the defendant, a ruinous and catastrophic effect on the cash market.</text>

            <text syncTime="4921.740" offset="19790346">And as a matter of economics, it necessarily follows that such is a fact that -- that to take 100 carloads or not a hundred, a thousand -- a hundred would even do it, but to take a thousand carloads of onions and deliver those on the futures market in satisfaction of outstanding contracts at that time would immediately reverberate into the cash market instantaneously.</text>

            <text syncTime="5282.653" offset="21233977">Would you be (Inaudible), were you to reverse this and send it back where the issue would be tried on its merits as to whether this contract was, as the petitioner here claims it was, an illegal combination in restraint of trade?</text>
            <text syncTime="5299.473" offset="21301269">Would you, by so doing, be enhancing or approving or adapting the policy which is always been the policy of the courts not to enforce an illegal contract?</text>
            <text syncTime="5314.274" offset="21360515">And I answer that by referring to the language in the Continental Wall Paper Company case wherein it is there pointed out that if the plaintiff had been allowed to recover in the Continental Wall Paper case, the Court would have been giving a judgment for a sum which was made up in execution of the agreement out of which came the illegal combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5344.689" offset="21482141">And if this judgment stands, the same result follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="5350.020" offset="21503457">This Court then would be allowing a judgment to stand for a sum of money which is made up in execution of the agreement out of which came the allegedly illegal combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5365.799" offset="21566568">Now, the nexus of the entire problem, I think as it -- it was briefed and as it was intended to be presented to this Court is simply this, whether or not the purchaser of a commodity may rely upon the illegality of the contract, illegal because of the Sherman Act as the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5388.678" offset="21658102">And for that proposition, we say this Court has never deviated from the rule that such is permissible as stated in the Continental Wall Paper Company case that that is the rule and that it should have been applied here and that the Seventh Circuit and the District Court were in error when they said that this Court had washed down, if I may use that expression, or weakened the policy as stated by this Court in the Continental case.</text>
