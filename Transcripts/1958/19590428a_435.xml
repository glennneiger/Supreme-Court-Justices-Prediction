            <label>Mr. Oscar H. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="18.763" offset="178448">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.714" offset="190255">With the Court's permission, I should like to take up, in the remaining time that I have at my disposal, the constitutional questions, both those relating to in camera inspection and those relating to the Sixth and Fifth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.047" offset="247515">And, I should also like to spend a little while, if I may, on the question of harmless error as it relates to this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.741" offset="282311">First, on the subject of in camera inspection, there are three aspects of that problem that may arise in -- in a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.478" offset="325256">The first is that you may have a statement which is admittedly an authenticated statement which admittedly, at least in part, touches upon the testimony of the witness but contains, in the view of the Government, irrelevant material.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.168" offset="384084">Now, Congress has provided in subsection (c) of 18 U.S.C. 3500 that, in those circumstances, the judge is to excise the irrelevant materials, preserving them for the benefit of the appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.279" offset="448449">Now, there are two other types of situations in which a similar comparable problem may arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.574" offset="473631">The Government may say “We don't have any statement of the witness which is producible under the statute at all, such as in this case and the next case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="102.236" offset="512293">And, the third type of situation is the Government may say “Yes, we have a statement of the witness signed, but it has nothing to do with this case at all and it has no relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.691" offset="550118">It doesn't touch upon the testimony of the witness at this trial.”</text>
            <text syncTime="115.723" offset="566314">Now, in each of those three situations, we think that the -- a proper procedure is for the judge to make an in camera inspection to determine whether the statement is producible and, if it is producible, whether certain portions of it should be excised.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="131.721" offset="630262">But you would not restrict the judge -- the trial judge to the examination of the document if his examination reasons, as a matter of expression and understanding to say “I can't tell from the argument if we could do this and I want to ask some questions.”</text>

            <text syncTime="156.999" offset="731408">The first thing I want to say is that I think that, in many instances, you can tell from an examination on a face of a document that it is not producible.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.632" offset="765889">For instance, as will appear, I believe, in the next case, if it appears that the interview with the potential or perspective witness took three hours and the document has 55 lines in it, you would think that it would not be a substantially verbatim recital of what went on at that interview.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.896" offset="834957">Or, if the document, on its face, contains statements by the agent that the potential witness was evasive or lying or -- or didn't know what he was talking about, you would know that that was not within the terms of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.235" offset="900263">Or, similarly, if the document contained a material that didn't come out of the mouth of the witness at all, material that clearly and obviously came from some other person, a third person, but someone else told the agent about the witness or what someone -- what the agent learned about the matters in controversy from some third person, you would know that that was not a statement of the witness.</text>

            <text syncTime="231.117" offset="1027845">Well, suppose, in this very case, there had been a statement by the agent, “I talked with Carlin.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.777" offset="1074448">Carlin denied having any knowledge whatever of this business.”</text>
            <text syncTime="250.294" offset="1104541">That's all that the statement says.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.097" offset="1115721">And then, Carlin testifies as Carlin testified at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.959" offset="1135156">Would that statement be producible under the statute?</text>

            <text syncTime="261.253" offset="1148426">I do -- I don't think that that statement would be producible because it is not a substantially verbatim recording of what the witness said, unless the judge, on inquiry, and that's the next point I'm coming to, in the normal case, the agent -- the witness is on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.632" offset="1213942">Carlin is on the stand.</text>

            <text syncTime="285.395" offset="1244975">Did you see one that was written up by the agent?</text>
            <text syncTime="287.841" offset="1254693">What did you tell the agent?</text>
            <text syncTime="288.956" offset="1259186">Was the agent taking notes?</text>
            <text syncTime="290.549" offset="1265560">Was there a shorthand reporter there?</text>
            <text syncTime="292.357" offset="1272769">Was there a recording machine?”</text>

            <text syncTime="1426.853" offset="5810761">And, if I might read just one sentence from an opinion of Judge Learned Hand in which he dealt with a comparable situation, he said “there is no way in which this conflict,” that is, the conflict between the right of the Government to retain certain things from the defendant and the right of the defendant to see other types of producible documents where you have a controversy as to whether it's a producible document, there is no way in which this conflict can be resolved except by making the judge's private inspection final, subject to review.</text>

            <text syncTime="2075.212" offset="8404198">One is that, as to Rubin, there was overwhelming evidence of guilt by many witnesses, not only -- Carlin was a very secondary witness with relation to Rubin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.665" offset="8442023">All of Carlin's testimony -- incriminating testimony was corroborated by other witnesses in the case, either Levi or the bookkeeper or other people, so that, there was nothing that Carlin said which stood on Carlin's testimony alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.646" offset="8505971">And, all -- in fact, the testimony of Carlin was, in part, corroborated by the defendant Rubin himself and by another defendant, Ades, who did take the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.814" offset="8546617">Now, that's the summary with relation to Rubin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.114" offset="8563858">As to Wool, I would say that Carlin did not implicate him at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.066" offset="8591653">He did not even come into the conspiracy admittedly until a period after Carlin had left the Office of the Bonita Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.232" offset="8620283">And, the only last thing I would like to say as to the argument that the counsel were deterred from asking for statements from other witnesses by the ruling of Judge Kaufman, two things, if I might.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.457" offset="8665213">Judge Kaufman said that, under a very slight suggestion of inconsistency, under the then-prevailing Second Circuit rule, he would order the production of the document.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.662" offset="8701994">They never made an effort to show with respect to any other witnesses, except one, as to whether there were prior inconsistent statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.169" offset="8728012">As to Porreca, one of the Prosecution witnesses, they got him to admit that he had made a prior inconsistent statement and they did not ask for the statement, so that even clearly on the Second Circuit rule and under Judge Kaufman's ruling, that would have been producible, but they did not ask for a correct statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.997" offset="8799378">And, so, we think that there is really no basis for saying that Judge Kaufman's ruling as to Carlin permeated the trial in the sense that it deterred the petitioner's counsel from asking for statements with respect to other words.</text>

            <text syncTime="2345.775" offset="9486503">If the Court please, I must say that, after listening to the argument of Mr. Davis, I can only conclude that the -- he has many different sides to his argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="2494.979" offset="10083244">And, if such a view exists, I would like to say that the Rubin -- rather, the Carlin testimony became very admissible against Mr. Lev.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.133" offset="10131937">Therefore, any impeachment of it would have been of great help to Mr. Lev in possibly obtaining an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.048" offset="10163597">The reason that it was admitted, the reason that the evidence was admissible against Lev, was because, although there may have been two conspiracies described by the Government as the Bonita conspiracy and the White Hat conspiracy and that Lev was involved only in the White Hat conspiracy and was insulated from the Bonita conspiracy by the obstructions of the Court that, therefore, the Carlin testimony was not admissible against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.931" offset="10291075">I would point out, if that thought is in the minds of any member of the Court, that the instructions of the trial court were, and they were so determined by the Court of Appeals, that there was one continuous conspiracy as to all defendants expect Lev, and he thereupon instructed that the acts of declarations and omissions of any conspirator during the life of that conspiracy were admissible against any other person who, at anytime, entered into the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.635" offset="10437883">So, there can be no question in my mind but one, Lev was seriously harmed by the error, if any.</text>

            <text syncTime="2634.835" offset="10642683">But, finally, the jury came back, after having been out some-24 or 36 hours, and asked whether or not one conspiracy was related to the other, and the judge gave an entirely inclusive instruction on it that I, as a lawyer, have a great deal of difficulty to understand.</text>

            <text syncTime="3113.265" offset="12556413">And, I would like to call the Court's attention to the examination of the witness Ford whose testimony, of course, was considered in Jenks, and this is precisely the testimony to which this Court referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.623" offset="12621824">Ford was asked “After you made your contact with the FBI, did you give them information concerning activities going on before you made contact with the FBI?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.874" offset="12658918">Answer, “Yes, because that is what led me to the FBI.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.314" offset="12672606">“And did you make those reports in writing?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.993" offset="12683368">Answer, “Some of them in writing and some of them oral.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.223" offset="12700296">Question, “When you gave oral reports, were they taken down by someone?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.797" offset="12718582">“I think some notes were taken.I think some notes were taken.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.897" offset="12742928">Question, “And after you gave the oral reports and the notes were taken, was something typed up for you to sign?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.318" offset="12980642">“No.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.768" offset="12980537">“Do you recall giving a written report to the FBI concerning the foundling convention of the progressive party in July of 1948?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.971" offset="12980433">Question, “But your recollection is that you did not give such a report?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.522" offset="12980328">Answer, “My recollection is that I told the FBI exactly what went on at the convention and some other events preceding that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.724" offset="12980224">“And was that written down?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.758" offset="12980120">“Did I write it?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.039" offset="12980015">“First, did you write it then?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.458" offset="12979911">“I don't recall.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.396" offset="12979806">“You don't recall?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.258" offset="12979702">“I don't recall that I wrote it down specifically, but I am pretty sure that I didn't.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.885" offset="12979597">“Did someone write it down as you told it to them?</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.447" offset="12979493">As you told it to them?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.598" offset="12979388">“I think some notes were taken.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.479" offset="12979284">“Isn't it a fact that you dictated something in the presence of a stenographer on that convention?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.416" offset="12979179">“Weren't you asked questions and didn't you give answers which were taken down by a stenographer?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.548" offset="12985553">“Your recollection about that is precise, is it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.091" offset="12995688">You are sure that you did -- that you did not either dictate a statement or answer questions which were taken down by a shorthand reporter?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.990" offset="13027349">Answer, “I am positive.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.262" offset="13036440">Now, I submit, again, respectfully to the Court that this Court decided in Jenks that notes, just notes of what a witness said which, quite obviously, might not be a substantially verbatim statement as to what he said, was admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.608" offset="13117837">I say that, in my opinion, the Court was holding that inadmissible documents are producible if relevant under the definition as given by the Court in Jenks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.892" offset="13170918">Now, I have listened here to Brother Davis and I have read the congressional debates over and over again, and there are pious avowals by all of the legislators and by the Government here that nobody indented to touch Jenks by this legislation, that all that they wanted to do is to codify it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.835" offset="13258689">Well, if what the Government is contending for here is so, they certainly went way past any codification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.794" offset="13290559">In fact, they put Jenks right out of -- out of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.270" offset="13308426">If this Court holds that the statute is exclusive and if this Court holds that it's constitutional, I, for the life of me, cannot see the objection by the Government to the production of any report of what a witness said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.329" offset="13376658">There is no fishing expedition involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.702" offset="13386167">The precise report was identified in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.118" offset="13407796">And I do not see why the Government should not produce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.769" offset="13418454">In fact, outside of Jenks, it seems to me that Berger, a famous decision of this Court, requires, as to -- as to the Canons of Ethics that a prosecutor turned over to a defendant, any material which he may have, any evidence, if you will, which he may have which is helpful to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.302" offset="13504554">And I think, really, that was the philosophy of this Court in handing down Jenks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.836" offset="13526706">Finally, I would like to say that some remark was made here yesterday that -- as to the Lutwak case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.719" offset="13554291">I appeared before the Court and argued that particular case and we lost it on a 5-3 decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.197" offset="13580204">And, I think Mr. Davis said that the majority opinion, applying the -- the language here, stated that the record shrieked of error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.671" offset="13626075">And, I would like to point out, before I conclude, that Mr. Justice Frankfurter and Mr. Justice Black and Mr. Justice Jackson dissented from the theory that the record did shriek of error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.845" offset="13682709">And I say --</text>
