            <text syncTime="33.048" offset="235604">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.787" offset="258487">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.116" offset="287848">The petitioner, Edgar B. Sims, who was the auditor of the State of West Virginia, has been subjected to personal liability under the penal provisions of Section 6332 of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.936" offset="363081">Now, to better clarify the facts of this case, I respectfully direct the Court's attention to Sections 6331 and 6332 of the Internal Revenue Code which may be found in the petitioner's brief in the appendix on pages 1A or A1 and A2.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.051" offset="483558">Section 6331 of the Code authorizes the Secretary the -- that is the Secretary of the Treasurer to collect delinquent taxes by levy upon all the property of the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.256" offset="552417">Section 6332 provides for the surrender of that property, and there is a penalty provision in that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.648" offset="601945">Because this entire case is based upon this particular section, I ask the Court's indulgence while I quote briefly from Section 6332.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.070" offset="663698">It is stated therein in subsection (a) under requirement, “Any person in possession of or obligated with respect to property or rights to property subject to levy upon which a levy has been made shall, upon demand of the Secretary or his delegate, surrender such property or rights or discharge such obligation to the Secretary or his delegate.”</text>
            <text syncTime="171.082" offset="787728">In (b) of that section entitled “Penalty for violation,” it stated, “Any person who fails or refuses as required by subsection (a) any property or rights to property, subject to levy, upon demand by the Secretary or his delegate, shall be liable in his own person and estate to the United States in a sum equal to the value of the property or rights not so surrendered.”</text>
            <text syncTime="204.205" offset="920221">Now, the issue, the principle issue here at this time is whether this petitioner should be held personally liable for the consequences of his acts performed in the line of his official duties as auditor of the State of West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.808" offset="1006634">There are, of course, many sub questions which must be discussed and answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.398" offset="1041011">It is the contention of the petitioner here this morning that the State is not a person, nor is this petitioner a person within the contemplation of Section 6332 and that he could not therefore be held personally and individually liable under the terms and provisions of that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.015" offset="1155427">It is further contended here by the petitioner that the broad general rule of law that a public officer should not be held personally liable for the consequences of his acts when performed in the official line of duties -- of his duties as such public officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.386" offset="1268903">Now, the lower courts --</text>

            <text syncTime="309.149" offset="1339956">The United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia held in effect that this petitioner and the State were included in the term person and therefore, entered a judgment against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.077" offset="1407666">The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed this judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.194" offset="1424175">And this Court granted certiorari thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.525" offset="1445491">The facts of this case are not complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.361" offset="1460851">There was no hearing, they are stipulated and are found in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.893" offset="1490944">But the fact show that certain state employees on the State of West Virginia were engaged in endeavors entirely separate on the part from their state employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.343" offset="1548727">That apparently was during the after-hours from such employment in -- well, it isn't shown in the record to clarify.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.513" offset="1581432">It appeared that certain state employees had engaged in catering services and that sort of thing after hours during the evening time.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.484" offset="1645275">That they gain -- earned incomes due to such outside employment and that they did not, apparently pay any federal income tax on this income so earned.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.573" offset="1713716">This is mentioned expressly for the purpose to show that no taxes on any income earned in their state employment is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.455" offset="1757184">That of course was withheld in accordance with law and was submitted to the Internal Revenue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1196.973" offset="4891251">Now, both of the District Court and the Court of Appeals readily acknowledged that neither the State nor an officer employee thereof was mentioned in these sections.</text>

            <text syncTime="1216.601" offset="4969827">I quote from the memorandum of opinion of the District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia which may be found in the transcript of record on page 26, and I will quote briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.758" offset="5038373">And the Court said in relation to the -- to the fact that the term -- that word “state” is not included in the term “person”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.859" offset="5070764">He said, “Well, I am somewhat disturbed by the provisions of Section 6332 (c), defining a person and that it does not mention officers or employees of a State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.279" offset="5128443">I think that there might be a valid argument that in not mentioning them, they were intended to be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.428" offset="5153102">But that would lead, as I view it, to a very illogical and unreasonable result.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.906" offset="5186957">Those are the words of the United States District Court and it is quite apparent that the Court of Appeals affirmed that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.001" offset="5243382">Now, this Court, this Honorable Court has very forcefully commented on that sort of reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.278" offset="5284446">In Crooks versus Harrelson in page -- in 282 United States which is mentioned in our brief at page -- pages 7 and 8, the Court in very forceful language stated that great caution must be exercised in rejecting the literal meaning of a statute in favor of a construction in harmony with a supposed spirit and purpose thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.633" offset="5433866">And, in so many words, the Court had this to say, I will not -- of course burden the Court with a quote of the entire section in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.985" offset="5479320">That the Court said that, “Laws enacted with good intention when put to the test frequently and to the surprise of the lawmaker himself, turn out to be mischievous, absurd or otherwise objectionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.418" offset="5541073">But in such case, the remedy lies with the lawmaking authority and not with the Courts.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.375" offset="5584854">I submit to Your Honors that the same reasoning applies in the instant case, should the Court have read words into the statute merely because of a supposed absurdity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.724" offset="5650265">If the statute is absurd, is it not up to Congress to correct the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.782" offset="5690493">Now, we believe as we stated, that the State is not included in this term “person”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.733" offset="5722258">But we further know that there are several factors which must be considered in determining that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.101" offset="5751724">One of course, is the legislative history of the section involve, that is again Section 6332.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.003" offset="5795401">We submit to Your Honors that an examination of the legislative history fails to reveal that Congress intended for its provisions to relate to a State.</text>

            <text syncTime="3635.827" offset="14646732">I think it maybe said in general that the petitioners' position in this case is that the Government cannot garnish either way of a state employee except through the state garnishment procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.595" offset="14709739">And of course, the lien and levy procedures set forth in Section 6321 and Section 6331, is a summary garnishment procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.076" offset="14751640">That's what it amounts to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.582" offset="14757700">The lien, the Government which attaches by the delinquent taxpayer refuses or fails to pay, is the equivalent of a court judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.550" offset="14801586">And the notice of the levy is the equivalent of process -- court process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.237" offset="14820289">The summary procedure which date way back to the 18th Century, I believe, in the internal revenue laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="3750.804" offset="15106591">The only argument that's really being made is that the Government can't use the summary procedure, the summary garnishment procedure provided by federal statute because he argues that the State and the state officer are not persons within the meaning of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3776.255" offset="15208364">And the petitioner's position on that is directly contrary to the rule that's already established by decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.609" offset="15249847">The argument is that the state is not included within the meaning of the word “person” unless it is expressly included.</text>
            <text syncTime="3796.294" offset="15288508">The rule established by several decisions of this Court and principlely, cases relating to revenue measures, is that a state is included within the meaning of the word person, unless a contrary intent is indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3815.056" offset="15363636">Now, no argument is made by the petitioner as to any contrary intent in this case, at least I -- it's difficult to discern any other than the fact that a state is involved and a state is a sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.121" offset="15431868">Actually, the sovereignty of the state is in no way affected by this notice of levy served upon the State Auditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3841.155" offset="15468022">The State's only interest is to pay the accrued salary either to the employee or to the employee's account in such a way as to discharge the obligation of the state to pay compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3856.779" offset="15530506">And of course that obligation would be discharged if Mr. Sims had honored the levis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3863.952" offset="15559137">That is, the money would be paid over on the delinquent taxpayers' obligation to the Government.</text>
