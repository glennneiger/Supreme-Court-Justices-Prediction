            <text syncTime="72.076" offset="391711">The Court please, Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Company versus Bowers, is Number 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.251" offset="424417">And Allied Stores of Ohio Inc. versus Bowers is Number 10, are appeals from the Supreme Court of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.071" offset="463705">The Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube case involved the question of the Ohio State taxation of imported ores and storage merchandise held by a resident manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.992" offset="519293">The Allied Stores case involves only the question of the Ohio State Taxation of storage merchandise held by a resident retail merchant.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.762" offset="566418">Since the facts in the two cases differ somewhat, I'll argue first the Youngstown case and then the Allied case.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.281" offset="600482">More specifically, the questions presented in the Youngstown case are, may an Ohio State statute constitutionally impose an ad valorem tax upon both iron ores, which have been imported from foreign countries and which were stored in the same form as imported and not commingled with other property of the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.032" offset="715525">As to the second question of the taxation of storage merchandise, does an Ohio State statute Section 5701.08, Revised Code of Ohio deny residents to the State the equal protection of the laws under the Constitution of United States by imposing an ad valorem property tax upon resident storage merchandise held for storage only, while at the same time accepting the storage merchandise of non-residents when similarly held for storage only.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.823" offset="882709">Those are the two questions, if the Court please, in the Youngstown case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carlton S. Dargusch, Sr.</label>
            <text syncTime="213.167" offset="956061">The constitutional questions involved, first, Article I, 10, cl.2, "No state shall without the Consent of Congress, laid any Impost or Duties".</text>
            <text syncTime="236.125" offset="1047907">That has been construed to include taxes on imports or exports except that which may be necessary -- absolutely necessary for executing its inspection laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.696" offset="1106108">The second constitutional provision involved is Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, "No state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection -- the equal -- the equal protection of the law."</text>
            <text syncTime="274.195" offset="1200149">Basically, the laws of Ohio and I'm referring specifically to 5709.01 Revised Code, lay a tax on personal property which is located in Ohio and used in business in that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.672" offset="1290010">At this point, it might be well, if I explain the provisions of the old Section 5701.08 Revised Code, which are in issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.287" offset="1352495">That section was amended effective September 30, 1955, but we are concerned here with the statute as it read before that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.502" offset="1397426">That -- that section imposed a tax upon the storage of property or upon property stored.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.700" offset="1446222">With the proviso, but agricultural products and merchandise belonging to a non-resident and held in the storage warehouse for storage only in the State, are not used in business.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.129" offset="1503901">So the property of the non-resident was excluded by that provision, while the property of the resident was taxed by the general provision taxing property held for storage.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.560" offset="1573595">The section as I said is since been amended with distinction between resident and non-resident withdrawn by the general assembly and a further limitation provided in that for a property to qualify as being stored in Ohio and excepted from taxation, it must've been shipped from without the State, held for storage in the State and destined for shipment outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.641" offset="1673906">That issue was not in the -- the case, but I wanted to point out to the Court, the statute has been amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.871" offset="1702849">The history of this case is the Tax Commissioner for the year 1954, assessed the imported iron ore and storage merchandise of the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.643" offset="1765961">On appeal to the State Board of Tax Appeal, the Ohio State Board of Tax Appeals, The imported iron ore was excluded from taxation and the storage merchandise was taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.691" offset="1818102">On this appeal of the Supreme Court of Ohio, both the imported iron ore and the storage merchandise were held taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.430" offset="1853106">At every stage in the proceedings, we raised the constitutional questions which we present to the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.801" offset="1906604">Now, the -- the facts have been stipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.278" offset="1936488">The Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Company imported ore from five foreign countries, Brazil, Cuba, Mexico, Liberia and the Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.483" offset="2009318">The ores from the first four, in other words, Brazil, Cuba, Mexico and Liberia, were purchased for relevant use in the appellant's open hearth furnaces, while the Seine River ore or Canadian ore was purchased for use in the blast furnaces of the taxpayer.</text>

            <text syncTime="553.896" offset="2318921">So far as the Seine River ore or Canadian ore was concerned, that ore was transported down the Great Lakes to Cleveland, Ohio and then over the State of Ohio by rail to Youngstown, Ohio and the Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.697" offset="2422157">As these ores were received in Youngstown, they were placed in piles and as we received additional shipments of Brazilian ore, for example and the same apply to all the ores, that particular type of ore, that identical ore was placed upon the prior shipment, but there was no commingling of Brazilian with Liberian, Cuban, Canadian or Mexican.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.899" offset="2538977">In other words, the ore pile at all times, contained only Brazilian ore.</text>
