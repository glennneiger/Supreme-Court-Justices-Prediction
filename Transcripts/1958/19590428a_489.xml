            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 489, Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company, Petitioner, versus United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.405" offset="141040">Mr. Hazard, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leland Hazard</label>
            <text syncTime="12.352" offset="152743">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.389" offset="184926">This is an antitrust case in which the petitioner, Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company, and six other defendants and two individuals were convicted of a price-fixing conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.625" offset="253889">The conviction was sustained in the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and petition for writ of certiorari was limited to the -- granted and limited to the question whether a grand jury testimony may be a prior statement within the meaning of Jencks versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.400" offset="364962">I'll state just enough of the facts to eliminate that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.272" offset="396413">A trade association known as the Mirror Manufacturers Association of which Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company, if I may, I'll refer to that company as PPG hereafter, PPG was not a member of the trade association.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.682" offset="466108">It held its 1954 annual meeting at Asheville, North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.725" offset="506232">A representative of PPG, W. A. Gordon, a manager of Plate Glass Sales, the only defendant -- individual defendant who was acquitted in the case, was present at this association meeting for the purpose of cultivating customers for polished plate glass.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.097" offset="607796">Mirrors are made, as I am sure the Court knows, by the silvering of one side of a certain quality of plate glass.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.063" offset="647607">Now, another name, Jonas, a name which will loom -- does loom large in the issue before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.910" offset="683029">The Government's principal witness, Jonas was the President of one of the larger mirror manufactures, not indicted in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.435" offset="733080">Jonas was not present at Asheville.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.116" offset="751888">There was concern there among the mirror manufactures present in Asheville about a shortage of plate glass, a shortage which was occurring particularly at the time when the market, which had been quite bad for mirrors, was looking up.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.100" offset="823777">And, there was discussion at Asheville among some of the mirror manufactures about an increase in price.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.038" offset="863483">Some of them made a telephone call and a joint call to Jonas who was not there and reported to him the discussion about the price of -- of plate glass mirrors.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.821" offset="934640">Jonas expressed disbelief.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.603" offset="945821">There had been a price war.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.207" offset="952195">It was not the best feeling, apparently, in some quarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.816" offset="970585">And, Jonas said he'd liked to talk to Gordon.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.901" offset="986990">And Gordon was requested to -- to call Jonas by some of those who had first called Jonas, and Gordon did.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.302" offset="1028577">The only testimony we have on what was said in that telephone conversation between Gordon and Jonas is the testimony of Jonas.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.812" offset="1086568">He said, first, that he -- Jonas was not much in favor of raising my prices at that time, but he asked Gordon if there was anything to this discussion and Gordon said he had heard, in some of the rooms, some conversation about price.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.671" offset="1166085">We must look again to the uncorroborated testimony of Jonas as to this portion of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.555" offset="1213628">Jonas said in his testimony that Gordon might have said, just like anybody would say, “You ought to be getting more for the product than we were getting for it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="292.477" offset="1273292">Now, Jonas testified that the alleged conspiracy could not have been effectuated without Jonas' participation.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.056" offset="1311640">And, he, himself, confessed -- conspirator claimed for himself indispensability.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.133" offset="1347897">The Asheville meeting ended at the end of the third day and, on the next day following, there was a meeting at a place called the “Bluffs,” an inn on Blue Ridge Parkway.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.086" offset="1395754">And, those present at this meeting were Messer, one of the defendants, Buchan, representing one of the corporate defendants, Stroupe, representing one of the corporate defendants, and Jonas who had not been present at Asheville but did go to the meeting at the Bluffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.484" offset="1477360">No one representing PPG was present at the meeting at the Bluffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.428" offset="1525112">Jonas was the only witness who testified that an agreement was reached at the Bluffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.847" offset="1554787">Other witnesses testified that the meeting was held but it was Jonas, and only Jonas, who testified that an agreement was reached there to increase the price to 78% off list.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.995" offset="1607346">This meeting at the Bluffs occurred on a Thursday.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.599" offset="1621765">And, on Friday, six companies announced a price change to 78 off list.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.922" offset="1663039">On the next day, one company followed, and then, on the following Monday, PPG announced from its High Point Warehouse, which had not been represented at Asheville, a price change to that same figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.197" offset="1740152">Jonas testified that he called Gordon in Pittsburgh on Friday, the day following the meeting at the Bluffs, and, not reaching Gordon, that he gave to Prichard, an associate of Gordon's, the message of the Bluffs meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.742" offset="1834297">Jonas testified that, again, on the following Monday, he called Prichard and asked Prichard if had given Gordon the message that Jonas had given to Prichard of the meeting about the Bluffs, and Jonas testified that Prichard said that he had.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.540" offset="1905560">This was categorically denied by Prichard.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.205" offset="1916217">He took the stand and testified that, although Jonas frequently called PPG, PPG was Jonas' supplier of plate glass, about shipments of glass, that Jonas had never reported to Prichard or spoken to Prichard about the meeting at the Bluffs or about the alleged conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.723" offset="2022275">I -- these are the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.685" offset="2030111">I come now to the question whether a record of grand jury testimony, having been kept, the transcript of that testimony constitutes a prior statement of the trial witness, subject to the standards of Jencks.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.826" offset="2134706">The Government makes a candid concession which, I think, justifies the notice of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.332" offset="2168665">It appears at page 30 of the brief and, while the Court is turning to that, I need mention only that Jencks holds that there's no need for a prior showing of conflict, that it's sufficient if the prior statement relates to the testimony of the witness, that only the defendant may inspect, that is, that inspection by the defendant through his counsel was the only adequate inspection, that inspection in camera is disapproved, and that executive privilege in that case, in the Jencks case, was no bar to the inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.964" offset="2343267">Now, the Government says, on page 30, at the bottom of the page, opposite of Numeral 1, “there is no need to deny that many of the considerations which led this Court in Jencks to order production of the informer's statements also tend to support petitioner's claim that they are entitled to equally free access to a witness prior grand jury testimony, but there is here present an important countervailing consideration which was absent in Jencks, the long-established policy that maintains the secrecy of the grand jury proceeding in the federal courts, citing United States against Procter and Gamble.”</text>
            <text syncTime="616.164" offset="2568025">Well, I need only mention that, in Procter and Gamble, no witness had taken the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.249" offset="2608358">I -- I do need to mention that it was in that decision in which this Court, not reaching the point that we have before us, noted that use of the grand jury transcript at the trial to impeach a witness, to refresh his recollection, to test his credibility, and the like, that these would be cases of particularized need where the secrecy of the grand jury proceeding is lifted discretely and limitedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.852" offset="2754748">The Government relies on hailing, may I say, after the concession, almost exclusively, on one of the foundations for the policy of grand jury secrecy mentioned in Procter and Gamble and else where, that is, the policy to encourage by the rule of secrecy free disclosures by persons who have information with respect to the commission of -- commission of crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.916" offset="2903019">The Government argues that the grand jury witnesses might not testify fully if they did not have the assurance of secrecy.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.404" offset="2945024">Now, may it please the Court, no grand jury witness ever had such an assurance or could have.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.173" offset="2980028">The witness knows that the Government may call him at the trial and, using the grand jury transcript, make him testify to that which he testified to at the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.149" offset="3035930">The witness knows that his trial testimony will not be limited to what he may wish to testify to there, regardless of what he said before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.374" offset="3084831">And, if the Government could give such an assurance, perjury would be encouraged.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.429" offset="3117119">If the trial testimony is consistent with the grand jury testimony, then disclosure occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.311" offset="3148570">The secrecy has been destroyed by the act of the Government in calling the witness and, if the trial testimony is not consistent with the grand jury testimony, then that is precisely the particularize need which entitles the defense to the examination of that record by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.025" offset="3263509">If the Government wishes to assure witnesses that there grand jury testimony will never be disclosed, the Government has a method for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.685" offset="3306141">It is the Government which decides whether or not to keep the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.269" offset="3324426">No law requires the taking of a transcript of a grand jury proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.442" offset="3349191">But, the Government, having once elected to take that record, must then make it available in a particularized need case for use on cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.092" offset="3395688">If the Government wishes to protect that witness under the rule of secrecy, then it need only refrain from taking the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1013.805" offset="4158568">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.765" offset="4166405">If I may answer Mr. Justice Harlan's question, the reason why the petitioners do not stand on the Jencks statute is clear from the terms of the statute, as well as the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.788" offset="4226487">The statute refers to statements made to an agent of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.920" offset="4251042">It's perfectly clear that all the legislators made the courts recognize that a grand jury is not an agent of the Government and, for that reason, the petitioners argue that the statute is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.334" offset="4312691">We do not believe the statute is irrelevant, but we do not rely on it as the source for our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.526" offset="4337455">If I may begin by stating what we believe to be the issue presented for decision by the Court, the only issue that's presented by the record in this case, the only issue that was tendered to Judge Paul who tried the case, the only issue which he decided, the only issue that was considered and decided by the Court of Appeals is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.782" offset="4466500">Whether, in a criminal case, after a witness for the Government has concluded his direct examination, and it appears that that witness has testified before the grand jury on the same general subject matter, whether, for that reason, and for that reason alone, the defendant is entitled as a matter of right, and not as a matter addressed to the discretion of the trial court but as a matter of law and as a matter of right, to delivery of the grand jury transcript of that witness' testimony directly to the defendant without any prior inspection or examination of any kind by the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.215" offset="4708185">And, wether he's entitled to all of the testimony given by that witness, rather than to any particular selected portions indicated by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.281" offset="4756459">That was the motion that was made by the defense counsel in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.948" offset="4775163">It appears in the record, pages 263 and 264.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.465" offset="4809226">Mr. Jonas was an important witness for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.621" offset="4825840">He was characterized by the Court of Appeals as the principal witness for the prosecution, but it is not fair to say that he was the only important or principal witness for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.773" offset="4878503">The Government case here was presented on a basis of testimony given by officials, employees of the defendant corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.263" offset="4932420">And, their testimony, as I hope I shall have an opportunity to demonstrate, corroborated in every important particular in Mr. Jonas' testimony, but Mr. Jonas was, as I say, an important, if not perhaps the most important, of the Government witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.346" offset="5008802">He had given testimony in expressed terms as to the formation of a price-fixing conspiracy and as to the existence of an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.514" offset="5057390">The other witnesses, while they had presented testimony as to the meetings, as to the discussions, as to the price, as to the participation of the defendants, as to the issuance of identical letters by them to their customers as to the prices, they had not used the word “agreement”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.074" offset="5127711">And, Mr. Jonas had and, for that reason, as I say, he was an -- he was a very -- he was a key witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.265" offset="5152475">And, on -- on page 263, after he had concluded the direct examination he was asked by -- on cross-examination, whether he had appeared before the grand jury and given testimony on the same general subject matter, he said, “Yes, three times.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.065" offset="5223633">Top of page 264, Mr. Humrickhouse, who was trial counsel for Pittsburgh Plate Glass, “Now, Your Honor, I move for the formal production of the grand jury transcript for this witness' testimony.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.743" offset="5278386">“The motion is denied.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1305.370" offset="5324884">Now, the basis for that motion, the groundwork for it had been laid a few minutes earlier in a colloquy between court and counsel that begins at the bottom of page 258 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.630" offset="5397922">There was a discussion as to the extent to which the defendant should receive certain government papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.295" offset="5448600">And Mr. Humrickhouse, at the bottom of page 258, said, “Your Honor, we would like to call Mr. Jonas in the absence of the jury and ask him two or three questions going into the question of whether or not he testified before the grand jury.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.125" offset="5507845">The Court, “What do you want to ask him?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.263" offset="5516413">“I want to ask him did he testify before the grand jury in Roanoke in December of 1956 and January -- February or March of 1957, how many times did he testify before the grand jury, and so on.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.418" offset="5565001">And, the Court, this is -- this is in the middle of page 259, Judge Paul says “I thought -- exactly what I thought you were going to do, move for the production of the grand jury minutes, and you are not going to get them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.849" offset="5622784">Mr. Humrickhouse, “We want to make the record.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.974" offset="5631248">And, the Court goes on and -- and says that if they could get Mr. Jonas' testimony here, “You can -- I'm reading now from the bottom of the page, “You can do that for each witness and get a complete transcript of the testimony before the grand jury, and that is not permissible.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.272" offset="5704495">Now, the starting point in this case is a proposition upon which the petitioners and the Government are in complete accord.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.114" offset="5779832">There is not disagreement that the matter here is governed here by Rule 6 (e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure promulgated by this Court in 1946, after submission to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.007" offset="5851408">It is also common ground between us that, prior to June 3, 1957, when this Court delivered the decision in the Jencks case, it is absolutely clear that no court had ever decided or even seriously suggested that a motion of this sort for automatic delivery to the defense of the grand jury testimony given by a government witness should be granted simply on the ground that the witness had testified before the grand jury on the same subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.369" offset="6000828">And, for that reason, that there might possibly be some prior inconsistencies which could be used for purposes of impeachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.121" offset="6043878">Prior to the Jencks decision, it was the law, as clear as any proposition has ever been the law, that the principle of secrecy of grand jury proceedings in this regard was go -- was controlling and that the defendant could not lift that secrecy for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.926" offset="6147114">And, the argument which is made here today is that the Jencks decision changed that and we -- the Government's position, in response, can be summarized very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.473" offset="6197269">We think that the Jencks decision does not deal with grand jury testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.921" offset="6215032">We think that when Congress, shortly after the Jencks decision, dealt with this problem, it -- evidence to recognition on both sides, both the proponents of a broad disclosure rule and the proponents of a narrow disclosure rule, were united in their view that the Jencks case had -- did not deal with grand jury transcripts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.462" offset="6313253">Those who opposed the legislation or argue that there was no reason for it because Jencks didn't deal with grand jury transcripts and that the fears as to the abuse and the lengths to which the decision might be applied were grounders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.843" offset="6386709">Those who argued for the legislation in Congress pointed to the Rosenberg case which, incidentally, was the case immediately be -- argued before this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.140" offset="6423907">The Rosenburg decision in the Third Circuit, in -- late in June of 1957, within a few weeks after this Court's decision in Jencks, the Third Circuit, in a short per curiam, had held that grand jury minutes, as well as the statements of the witness Meyer and Dirks in the preceding case should have been turned over to the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.823" offset="6514709">And, that was pointed to as a horrible example of lower court misconstruction of the Jencks case which ne -- which called congressional delimitation of the scope of Jencks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.360" offset="6572805">So that, it's clear from the legislative history that Congress understood that the Jencks decision did not extend to the production of grand jury minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.027" offset="6631528">It's perfectly clear that that was the reason why no -- nothing was included in the statute to deal with it and, if the petitioners are right in their contention that they are entitled to this automatic delivery without judicial inspection, without any sort of screening by the judge in the elimination of irrelevant matter, the elimination of matter referring to innocent third persons, matter containing questions asked by the grand jurors, and so on, they just get it all intact, you will have the anomalous result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.529" offset="6801533">The grand jury minutes which have always been regarded is entitled to the highest degree of protection from disclosure will be in -- will have less protection than statements made to the F.B.I.</text>

            <text syncTime="1771.756" offset="7190444">And, the -- it would had -- it was argued to the Court there that the rule was archaic, that it was inflexible, that perhaps it should be changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.786" offset="7230568">And, the Court recognized that, perhaps, that might be so, but the Court said -- the Court rejected that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.757" offset="7258363">It said if the rule is to be changed, it ought to be changed either by legislation or by an amendment to the rule, and the change should not be made in the decisional process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.258" offset="7304443">And the -- and the Court pointed out that if the change were made in the context of an amendment to the rule, it would be opportunity for hearings, for receiving data, and perhaps, more important than anything else, for receiving the recommendations of the judicial conference.</text>

            <text syncTime="1968.937" offset="7979133">It's a problem that has existed, certainly, ever since the institution of the grand jury, which goes back to before the Norman Conquest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.814" offset="8018631">I'm very conscious of the fact that this Court has addressed itself many times to the broad proposition of the secrecy of the grand jury proceedings and whether, as a matter of policy and logic, it's desirable to continue it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.313" offset="8096580">And, the Court has always rejected any attempt to violate the principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.168" offset="8128031">In the -- in the Johnson case, there's reference made to the indispensible secrecy of the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.470" offset="8153213">In Mr. Justice Black's opinion, in the Costello case, he refers to the grand jury as part of our federal constitutional system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.068" offset="8183620">It's a -- it was put -- it's explicitly referred to in the Fifth Amendment as a -- as the initial step in a criminal prosecution, and it's there not only for the benefit of the Government, but it's there for the benefit of the accused because our history is full of instances where the independence of the grand jury has been an obstacle, a barrier against unfounded prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.776" offset="8290513">Now, I'm conscious of the fact that our greatest judges, judges with the most intimate experience with this problem, such as Judge Augustus Hand, the Judge Learned Hand, whenever they've talked about the grand jury, they've expressed horror at the thought that -- one might be able to inspect grand jury minutes freely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.681" offset="8394062">Now, it's against that background of centuries of history that we consider these contentions that are being made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.482" offset="8441292">Now, if -- as a matter of abstract theory, if we were sitting in a room where no one had ever heard of the grand jury and someone said “let's establish this and organize an institution called the grand jury,” what about the matter of secrecy?</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.015" offset="8507434">I -- I agree that there are weighty arguments to be made on both sides of the proposition, but those arguments have been -- had been weighed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.392" offset="8548916">They have been resolved, and Rule 6 (e) has resolved them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.696" offset="8566157">And, Rule 6 (e) didn't me -- introduce anything new.</text>

            <text syncTime="2121.769" offset="8590399">And, certainly, it's surprising to us to find that, in 1959, it's argued -- this point is being argued to Your Honors as if it were a new one and that the Jencks case, somehow, had wiped the slate entirely clean and that we start form scratch.</text>

            <text syncTime="2423.848" offset="9798719">It's part of our constitutional system for trying criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.343" offset="9820766">That's not true in the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.242" offset="9828289">In many states, grand juries have either been abolished or is trial by information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.086" offset="9851695">In some States, I believe, California is one of them, it's -- there is a statute that says that the defendant may get the grand jury transcript simply by paying for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.986" offset="9887326">In New York -- in New York, there's the -- New York adopted the arguments which were rejected by this Court in the Costello case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.545" offset="9929540">In New York, defendant may challenge an indictment on the ground that there wasn't enough evidence before the grand jury to justify the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.224" offset="9964231">So, in New York, in order to permit a defendant to make that kind of an argument, they are very liberal in giving him access to the grand jury minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.263" offset="10000384">And, I think that, to some extent, explains the liberality of the Second Circuit rule as to the inspection of grand jury minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.699" offset="10034134">I think there's been an influence of the state practice in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.668" offset="10070079">Now, I would just like to point out, in that regard, that the Fourth Circuit in its opinion here, opinion by Chief Judge Sobeloff, did not deal with this problem in terms of absolutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.168" offset="10180002">Judge Sobeloff did not say that the defendant never gets an opportunity to inspect the grand jury minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.004" offset="10219395">The -- the Court recognized that we're dealing here with two very important interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.917" offset="10243009">Interests that are of concern to both sides, to the Government, as well as to the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.705" offset="10266206">The interest of a defendant in having a fair trial, the interest of a defendant in having fair opportunity for cross-examination, that's of concern to the Government, too, as well as the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.448" offset="10317197">And, the interest of the -- and, the interest in preserving the integrity, the independence, the efficiency of the grand jury, well, that's not merely of concern to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.955" offset="10359202">That's of vital concern to defendants, to the accused, to have that kind of an institution and, because it's a question of balancing two principles, two interests, accommodating each as much as possible to the other, that Judge Swan in the Alper case, the leading case in the Second Circuit and Judge Sobeloff here said it's dangerous to lay down any fixed rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.358" offset="10472782">That, ultimately, it's -- it comes down to a matter of a sound judicial discretion that a trial judge is always under a duty to examine the grand jury minutes if he has any reason at all to suspect that the witness may be unreliable, that he may be untrustworthy, that he may be giving testimony which is at variance with what he testified elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.825" offset="10574660">The trial judge is always under that obligation and he cannot escape it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.352" offset="10592737">He -- the trial judge always has, in the courtroom, the prosecutor who has those grand mi -- who has seen the grand jury minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.898" offset="10627009">And, if the Court so desires, it can call upon the prosecutor --</text>

            <label>Mr. Leland Hazard</label>
            <text syncTime="3283.551" offset="13237582">I say that either he does not have the discretion under Rule 6 or he abuses it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.034" offset="13267466">I don't care which it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.549" offset="13273527">Rule 6 gives a permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.911" offset="13287006">It does not contain a prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.276" offset="13300485">And, I say that the permission given in that rule was not validly exercised here by withholding the -- the transcript.</text>

            <text syncTime="3341.276" offset="13468505">You then say that gives the Court a discretion to do it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Leland Hazard</label>
            <text syncTime="3344.538" offset="13481566">I -- I -- well, otherwise, the jury or attorney, interpreter or stenographer may disclose matters occurring before the grand jury only when so directed by the -- by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.320" offset="13520645">This, I say, gives the Court a discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.985" offset="13535274">There is one point, Mr. Justice Whittaker, that I -- I want to make clear in this connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.415" offset="13561083">That is, that there is a difference between production and use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.864" offset="13582817">Our position is that once the witness has been put on the stand, once he has testified to the same subject matter as he testified to before the grand jury, then counsel for the defense must have access to the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.547" offset="13637569">Otherwise, the defendant is denied the right of counsel, unless his counsel can examine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.931" offset="13671111">Now, having examined that it's entirely conceivable that the Government may bring many matters to the attention of the trial judge, the judge -- trial judge himself may, on his own motion, consider many matters which will be withheld but only after counsel for the accused has had the acces and has made the examination or the right to make the examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.070" offset="13779675">I would invite the attention of the Court, in closing, to what I believe the Government is after here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.076" offset="13831711">It simply wishes to keep the grand jury testimony as its exclusive tactical weapon, for its own use, to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.086" offset="13875702">Now, in a democracy, we allow the grand jury, a great body of inquisitorial powers, and this is necessary in the interest of discovering the evidences of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.214" offset="13940276">But, to extend the inquisition into the courtroom by the devise of withholding that transcript from the defense which has been used for the prosecution, that goes too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.010" offset="14003388">That's our case.</text>
