            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 45, Beacon Theatres, Incorporated, Petitioner, versus The Honorable Harry C. Westover, Judge of the United States District Court of the Southern District of California, et al.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.809" offset="166640">Mr. Corinblit, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack Corinblit</label>
            <text syncTime="20.535" offset="185553">Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, may it please this Honored Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.017" offset="215437">This case presents the issue as to whether the respondent in this case has improperly denied petitioner a jury trial as to issues related to violations of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.607" offset="273847">And whether the rules of law announced by the Court of Appeals to accomplish this result are or are not contrary to the Rules of Civil Procedure promulgated by this Court, adopted by the Congress and are contrary to the Seventh Amendment of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.928" offset="343124">The case briefly arose in the Southern District of California wherein a complaint was filed by Fox West Coast Theatres Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.166" offset="388054">The complaint was captioned, “Fox West Coast Theatres Corporation versus Beacon Theaters, Inc.”</text>
            <text syncTime="76.915" offset="411042">It was entitled a complaint for declaratory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.387" offset="432880">After the petitioner here, was named defendant there, filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction and that was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.546" offset="469556">Petitioner filed an answer in which he raised an affirmative -- filed an answer in affirmative defense, filed a counterclaim against the plaintiff and in other party and demanded jury trial as to the complaint, the answer and the counterclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.117" offset="539878">The grounds upon which the petitioner argued that it was entitled to a jury trial as to the complaint -- as to the complaint standing alone were as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.587" offset="573733">The first, that the Seventh Amendment guarantees a jury trial as to actions of law, actions of common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.131" offset="607901">This was an action for declaratory relief which is not an action at common law nor is it an action traditionally known as an action in equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.721" offset="646248">That the right to trial by jury and an action for declaratory relief turns upon the basic nature of the case and turns upon the -- the kind of the case for which the declaratory action is a substitute.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.511" offset="709465">That in this action, it was apparent from the face of the complaint, from the allegations contained therein that it was a substitute for an antitrust damage suit and that its basic issues were those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.331" offset="776652">And that since under well-established rules, in antitrust damage suits, a -- the plaintiff and defendant are both entitled to a jury trial that therefore plaintiff or defendant -- petitioner here was entitled to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.314" offset="836629">The complaint to make this point was not a very lengthy one.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.107" offset="867767">It alleged, first, that -- it alleged, first, that it was brought under the declaratory relief provisions of the judicial code.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.378" offset="968913">As to page -- at page 10, the complaint appears in our record.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.899" offset="986990">It alleged, first, that it was brought under the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.547" offset="1005589">It was entitled, “Complaint for Declaratory Judgment”.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.634" offset="1017919">But in the second paragraph of the complaint after the first, as one sentence, there was alleged that there was a controversy in excess of $3000.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.066" offset="1055640">And that the matter in controversy arises under the law of the United States to which Sections 1 and 2 of the Act of Congress of July 2nd entitled, “An Act to protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints and monopolies”, commonly known as the Sherman Act and the Section 4 of the Act of October 15, 1914, the amendatory thereof commonly known as the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.065" offset="1143620">That Section -- Section 4 of the Clayton Act is the statute which gives private persons who are injured, by violations of the antitrust laws, a right to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.901" offset="1199000">It is the damage provision of the antitrust laws relating to private individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.773" offset="1222510">So that in paragraph 2, there is a rather straightforward statement that the complaint arises under the antitrust laws and under the section of the Clayton Act which gives a private right to damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.357" offset="1280815">The complaint then alleged that described the parties, the plaintiff, Fox West Coast Theatres Corporation as a company organized in -- operates in the neighborhood of 150 motion picture theatres primarily on the West Coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.264" offset="1340479">The defendant, Beacon operated the theatre -- opened the theatre, a drive-in theatre just outside of San Bernardino, California where Fox West Coast had for many years, operated a conventional theater as a theater with four walls and a ceiling.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.614" offset="1401814">The complaint alleged, then, that there were eight major companies in the United States that produced films.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.806" offset="1426578">And these were these -- and the complaint expressly stated that they constituted in the aggregate, this is at page 13 of the record, constant in the aggregate, the major distributors of motion pictures in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.966" offset="1487287">Thereafter, the complaint alleged that there had been a prior antitrust case between the Government and these major suppliers of motion pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.988" offset="1519365">It was the case known as United States against Paramount which -- which started with the District Court, came to this Court, went back to the District Court openly affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.746" offset="1558340">It was then alleged that there was a dispute between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.227" offset="1576312">The complaint alleged that the plaintiff, Fox West Coast Theatres Corporation had for many years operated a theatre in San Bernardino on what was known as a first-run in clearance basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.585" offset="1625736">That is, Fox West Coast had for many years licensed from this major distributors, the privilege or whatever you will call it, or at least there was a practice at that time to license to it a first-run.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.375" offset="1680906">This Court has reviewed that problem often.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.301" offset="1692609">First-run is the right to exhibit a picture exclusively first and that license clearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.645" offset="1725942">The clearance is an agreement that you'll find in the cases and recognize in the industry as an agreement between a distributor of motion pictures and the exhibitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.722" offset="1762304">The two parties agree that during the time that that exhibitor will exhibit the motion picture, that no other theatre will be permitted to exhibit that picture for a given period.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.579" offset="1801697">It's in the nature, it's been called, analogized to the common law agreements on not to compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.869" offset="1830849">That is analogized to those cases where a seller of a business selling goodwill agreed with the buyer that he would not compete for a given period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.228" offset="1868257">The Court will recall those -- those agreements were held finally to be unlawful if unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.241" offset="1904306">That is, if extended it too far, too greater area or extended into a length of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.987" offset="1935339">They were analogized -- they have been analogized by this Court to those common law, unreasonable restraints of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.341" offset="1964701">And the -- the courts have held, in the motion picture industry, this Court among them, that such clearances were lawful if reasonable, unlawful if unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.103" offset="2003780">One aspect of unreasonability, the courts have held, is whether the clearance is granted between theatres that are not substantially competitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.124" offset="2035858">Again, analogizing it to the common law rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.244" offset="2052368">For if an agreement by a seller of a business as to goodwill, that if there was an agreement that he would not compete within an area broader than it was -- than was necessary, such agreements were not enforced because they were unnecessary and because they were basically restraints of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.859" offset="2130840">And since they were unnecessary, they would not be enforced by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.348" offset="2148812">For that they would then be unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.207" offset="2164172">That rule of law, namely, that the clearances between theatres which are not substantially competitive is an-- is an unreasonable restraint of trade as a proposition of law which I understand neither party to contest here based upon this Court's decisions on the recognized decisions in other courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.663" offset="2230000">And so the complaint alleged that for many years, Fox West Coast had operated the -- its theatre on this basis, an exclusive running clearance over theatres in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.977" offset="2271274">And it -- it was alleged that a controversy had arisen because of the -- of the opening -- because a theatre -- a new theatre was about to come into existence, namely, petitioner's theatre here, a drive-in theater located some 11 miles from downtown San Bernardino.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.420" offset="2341073">The allegation was that the petitioner, Beacon Theatres made this contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.276" offset="2368449">It contended that its drive-in theater was not and would not be substantially competitive with the downtown San Bernardino theatre.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.099" offset="2403767">And that it contended, therefore, that if any distributor granted clearance, entered into a restrictive agreement that I've described, such a -- such an agreement would be unlawful under the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.415" offset="2457057">The complaint alleged that Fox, on the other hand, took a contrary position.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.490" offset="2473357">That it contended those two theatres were not or were substantially competitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.811" offset="2494568">And that, therefore, if either of them licensed, they first run and either of them obtained an agreement, a clearance agreement, that such an agreement would not be unlawful within the meaning of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.923" offset="2551097">The complaint there, then alleged that in -- restated this proposition in terms of rights, that is to say, it stated that -- that the plaintiff, Fox West Coast, contends that it had an equal right with Beacon to negotiate with each distributor independently for that prior running for a clearances between the two theatres.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.736" offset="2650363">The -- this was the end of this -- after the completion of this paragraph, there then was alleged a paragraph XII, which became of some importance to the Court of Appeals which is what I mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.437" offset="2705115">It was alleged in this -- in the next paragraph that petitioner, Beacon Theatres had threatened Fox West Coast and had told Fox that it -- that it had threatened the distributors.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.446" offset="2765197">That if any distributor granted clearance between these two theatres, that the petitioner, Beacon, would file an antitrust case, a damage antitrust case against -- against any distributor who so did.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.744" offset="2826324">While its not alleged, if you will recall, that in the prior paragraph, it is alleged, but not in this paragraph that the -- the difference of opinion was as to whether these theatres were competitive such a clearance will be unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.323" offset="2868642">And so it was alleged that petitioner told Fox and told Fox that it had told the distributors, that if any such contract was entered into, it would file a damage suit under the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.994" offset="2919320">It was then alleged that these threats which it has alleged in the complaint were made to Fox and Fox had been informed that we had threatened the distributor.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.771" offset="2958503">It was alleged that these threats exercise a coercion upon the distributors and resulted in the fact -- and resulted in depriving Fox from obtaining first-run and clearance in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.701" offset="3050141">A complaint, then alleged, to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.698" offset="3058186">The plaintiff was without any speedy or adequate remedy at law and will be irreparably harmed unless and I'm quoting, “Defendants and its officers, agents and employees are restrained and enjoined from instituting any action under the antitrust laws against the plaintiff and said distributors or any of them based upon the facts hereinabove alleged, during the pendency of this action and until such time as the Court shall determine whether or not the plaintiff and defendant have an equal and correlative right to license a prior run with clearance on behalf of their respective theatres."</text>
            <text syncTime="770.744" offset="3186395">This is the body of the complaint in which the allegation was made that -- that unless the plaintiff -- the petitioner here, Beacon, is restrained from suing for damages under the antitrust laws, during the pendency of the case that there will be irreparable injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.397" offset="3256926">Thereafter, the complaint set forth its prayer, the prayer is a fairly simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.629" offset="3277928">The first one, asked the Court, the word is used to decree that a grant of clearance between a first-run theatre in San Bernardino between the Fox Theatre and the petitioner's theatre is not a violation of the antitrust laws and is not a violation of the decree in the Paramount case.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.604" offset="3349817">Secondly, that it be decreed that the distributors are each them entitled to negotiate with the plaintiff and defendant and other operators of theaters in the competitive area equally for a prior run in the said area.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.273" offset="3396420">Third, that the Court declares such, otherwise, for that pending file decision of the Court herein defendant Beacon and its theatres and its officers, agents and employees be restrained and enjoined again from commencing any action under the antitrust laws against plaintiff and the distributors hereinabove named arising out of the facts or controversies.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.291" offset="3484505">This was the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.294" offset="3492551">And the petitioner here, Beacon, when it made its demand for jury trial, in the trial court, as to the complaint took a very simple position and stated that -- that this was a complaint for declaratory relief, and a complaint for declaratory -- in a complaint for declaratory relief if the action is a substitute, for a suit at law, namely, a suit for damages under the antitrust laws that the petitioner is entitled to a -- that the defendant, either side was entitled to a jury trial and that this was on the face of the complaint an action for declaratory relief brought under the section of the antitrust laws relating to private damages and was not -- and that therefore, we were entitled to a -- to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.061" offset="3667571">I might point out that it may not be an important point.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.490" offset="3681364">The complaint I might say was not verified.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.429" offset="3693066">This maybe of some significance because Rule 65 of the Federal Rules provide that if you want a preliminary restraining order, you've got to verify or you've got to put in an affidavit that during the entire pendency of these proceedings, all the time the matter was in the trial court, no application was made for injunction to restrain us from filing the antitrust case or any other type and no pleading, no papers were filed which will sustain such a -- such a request.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.309" offset="3820648">The argument that we're entitled to a jury trial on this -- on the complaints standing -- standing alone was based not only upon the -- these allegations which seem straightforward based upon the analogy of the common law, to the common law covenants not to compete, based -- based also upon the fact well known to these -- to Fox West Coast that these problems of -- of restraints of trade by clearances have long been litigated in damage cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.400" offset="3941021">That is as a fairly common -- common matter that appears in case after case involving these -- involving Fox.</text>

            <text syncTime="999.792" offset="4102562">Yes, Your Honor, squarely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.623" offset="4109876">It was raised by -- the first issue was raised in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.676" offset="4134118">The -- I was saying that the -- the matter of -- of the trial -- of issues of substantial competition and clearance had long for many years been part of the damage cases brought by litigants where they thought they had a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.156" offset="4199946">A -- a typical case in this connection is one that we cited -- cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.988" offset="4219277">It's the case of J&amp;J. Theatres, Inc. a Second Circuit case, 212 F.2d 840 in which the -- in that case, the contention was by an individual theatre that it was unlawfully being deprived of the opportunity to play pictures on a given run by reason of unreasonable clearances and clearances over its theater which was not competitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.798" offset="4322513">In that case, the instruction was given, as follows, which is of some interest as to demonstrate the way in which this issue arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.889" offset="4350934">If you find that this -- there -- there was substantial competition between the two theatres, then plaintiff has failed to establish the element of te prior run and clearance in favor of the Park Plaza over the Luxor was unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.162" offset="4400044">And your verdict should be for the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.571" offset="4405687">That is, the issue is one of unreasonable restraint of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.663" offset="4418017">If there is a conspiracy to impose clearance and the clearance is between theatres that were not competitive, you've got an unreasonable restraint of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.337" offset="4448737">That issue, I might say, goes not only to the unreasonable restraint of trade but, of course, to the issue of conspiracy itself because, if a court were to conclude or jury trial, if that were to conclude, that these clearances were unreasonable and that they were uniformly granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.445" offset="4517177">A trier of fact would be entitled to infer, not required to infer, as this Court held, the Theatre Enterprises case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.991" offset="4547375">But entitled to infer, that it was pursuant to a conspiracy in the sense that you can infer from uniform unreasonable acts in a business circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.084" offset="4599724">To put the -- the picture together, a jury is ordinarily permitted to make such -- such an inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.339" offset="4624697">So, that this issue had been litigated and was regularly litigated as part of private treble damage cases in jury trials and known by the plaintiff, Fox West Coast to be -- to -- that that was known by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.485" offset="4681331">Their company has been the defendant in a number of antitrust cases, as the major distributors have, arising out of this Court's -- out of the -- out of the Sherman Act as well as out of the Paramount case itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.138" offset="4739950">When in a -- we made a demand for jury trial as to the complaint in the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.232" offset="4764296">In the answer, I might say, we raised the -- the fact that the plaintiffs were violating the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.740" offset="4786343">We filed an affirmative defense which said we thought that they were violating the antitrust laws and then we filed a counterclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.305" offset="4808600">It's one document, the answer from the defense in counterclaim and endorsed upon the document as request for jury trial as to the complaint, the answer in the counterclaim is expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.825" offset="4846634">The counterclaim raised the antitrust issues and sought damages as well as other conjunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.332" offset="4876727">The proceedings then took place as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.141" offset="4887907">The motion was filed to strike our demand for jury trial as to the complaint in the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.869" offset="4914866">The motion was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.540" offset="4921553">The motion was filed to strike our allegations and our answer in affirmative defense that the defendants were violating the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.374" offset="4948825">This motion was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.087" offset="4955721">A motion was filed to sever the complaint for the counterclaim and to try the complaint first, ahead of the counter claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.473" offset="4981217">And this motion was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.099" offset="4995741">The -- upon these motions, I -- I've broken them up but of course the motions were in one and that there were three parts if I'd describe them independently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.514" offset="5037432">We filed a --a petition for writ of mandamus in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.191" offset="5056136">We based our request for mandamus upon this Court's seemingly long line of opinion, decisions which said -- and other Courts of Appeals including the Ninth Circuit which seemed to indicate that in jury trial matters, where a jury trial has been denied that that was one of those exceptional issues which Courts of Appeals should hear by way of mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.521" offset="5149445">I like to say that the Court of Appeals never passed upon that question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1277.844" offset="5214751">Now, I will submit that that was mandamus out of this Court and not mandamus out of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.350" offset="5244740">There has not been any -- there have not been any law to the effect that really makes a distinction between the two and the Courts of Appeals, they have granted mandamus and jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.483" offset="5281311">I have argued that there is not a distinction between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.981" offset="5295313">The point that I -- I wish to make is that I do -- don't believe that that question is before you here unless you conclude that this is a matter of jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals because there is no cross-petition of certiorari in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.331" offset="5348707">There is no issue raised that there was -- that the discretion was abused because the Court of Appeals distinctly refused to pass upon that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.208" offset="5380159">It went to the merits of the case without passing upon whether, in its discretion, it would or would not issue mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.516" offset="5409416">And they said so in their opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.199" offset="5416208">And we didn't raise that question and when we raised our three questions in the petition for certiorari, no cross-petition was filed by the other side and if the matter was in -- and -- and therefore, no issue of the willingness or unwillingness to exercise discretion, is I believe, before this Court at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.001" offset="5495411">In the Court of Appeals, when we filed, I might say an application for leave to the file a writ of mandamus, the Court of Appeals for Ninth Circuit follows that practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.448" offset="5533132">I -- I'm not sure that it's not filed -- followed everywhere but at least it is in the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.107" offset="5551835">You just can't file automatically and they -- they considered it and they decided we ought to be granted a leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.117" offset="5571793">We were permitted to file a petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.880" offset="5578898">And the respondent judge was ordered to show cause why -- why the petition shouldn't be granted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1451.184" offset="5908146">That is to say, you can't in the complaint for the Court declaratory relief, reverse positions and destroy the right of jury trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1545.332" offset="6284727">Now, I might point out that the Court ignored the fact that the only prayer in the complaint and the only substantive allegation in the complaint asked for an injunction, pendente lite.</text>

            <text syncTime="1808.386" offset="7336939">And the Court in that case said, “In the federal courts, this right -- right of trial by a jury cannot be dispensed with except by the assent of parties entitled to it nor can it be impaired by any blending with the claim properly cognizable of law of a demand for equitable relief in aid of a legal action or during its pendency.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.328" offset="7416665">Now, of course, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure has been designed precisely to blend, that is, in the sense of giving a litigant the right and the obligation to bring all his claims in at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.824" offset="7474657">The whole purpose of the -- of the uniting the rules under the Federal Rules was to --to encourage that, to get it all settled at one time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1857.170" offset="7532022">But, when this Court -- when Congress passed the enabling statute which sure led to the adoption of this rule, Congress said that in adopting these rules, you shall not incur the right of trial by a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.947" offset="7591163">And of course, Rule 38 said the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.097" offset="7603806">And there was never any intent indicated by any decision of this Court that the mere adaption of the rule which now permits a litigant to bring actions of law and actions of equity, at the same time, to destroy the right of jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.107" offset="7655842">So, that if blending couldn't be permitted to destroy the right of jury trial prior to the rules, surely, it is not permitted to destroy the right of jury trial under the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.496" offset="7701400">And the interpretation by the Court of Appeals here had that result because, looked at correctly in a sense, it can be -- if you're going to argue that there's any equitable features at all in this complaint, properly construed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3122.274" offset="12592462">I must confess at the outset that the complaint which is here for construction by the Court is not a model of pleading as -- as observed by Judge Pope in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.230" offset="12656306">However, I think viewed fairly and liberally as pleadings must be viewed now, it does state a cause for equitable relief and states it clearly.</text>

            <text syncTime="3165.437" offset="12765080">And that is this, in the complaint, we sought not an award of first-run by the distributors but the right to negotiate for first-run with clearance, equally with, Mr. Cornblit's client, free of threats and duress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.435" offset="12853164">We couldn't demand that any distributor give us a first-run.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.788" offset="12870510">All we seek -- all we ask for here is the right to not have the door shut in our face.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.548" offset="12905514">That is the extent of the remedies sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.109" offset="12927770">Now, I have a minute perhaps in which I can answer Mr. Justice Black's inquiry of Mr. Cornblit as to whether, and I maybe paraphrasing, traditional equitable allegations are made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.712" offset="13034245">I will refer to page 18 of the record, paragraph 12 of our complaint and after having alleged that if clearance is granted, a treble damage action will be filed, we say further that said threats and the duress and coercion upon the distributors arising out of and resulting from said threats of litigation, threaten to and have in fact deprived plaintiff and its said California theatre of the right to negotiate for motion pictures upon their first-run in the San Bernardino area and to negotiate for clearance over theatres in competition with plaintiff's said theatre upon said first-run including defendants Bel-Air Drive-in Theatre.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.660" offset="13269974">Then I come to this which is a traditional and conventional allegation in suits of equity, that plaintiff is without any speedy or adequate remedy at law and will be irreparably harmed --</text>
