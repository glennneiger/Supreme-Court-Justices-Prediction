            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">-- and that is we feel the unfairness inherent in the scope of the evidence, it opens up to use by the Government in such a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.720" offset="166222">We have charged this here or raised it as a second question namely that there was a fatal variance between -- fatal and prejudicial variance between the indictment and the particulars and the proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.474" offset="217318">The Government contends that we have, in effect, smuggled a question in.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.779" offset="234454">I don't -- I feel that it was fairly raised, but certainly, it was not expressly raised on the petition for a certiorari, but we feel that it's clear on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.807" offset="266637">The defendant here was indicted for receiving $15,000 on February 24th.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.915" offset="290983">He asked for particulars and the Government said it was -- it was received in the form of two checks, for $7500 each on February 21st.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.308" offset="328600">At that point, the defendant fairly foresaw, I submit, the scope approved for the trial, February 21st, the collective bargaining agreement, February 24th.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.201" offset="368201">Instead of the trial, he was met with evidence of these withdrawals of moneys from the bank accounts extending to April 14th, almost two months after the date specified in these particulars.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.932" offset="411146">Even if this is not available to us as in the point on appeal, we say that this fact cuts to the invalidity on the Government's theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.024" offset="443434">Because certainly, if evidence, two months after the date which Section 302 deals with, namely, the receiving or the paying by the employer, the receiving by the employee can be used, why could an evidence six months, eight months, a year, payments to welfare funds are made annually under such a scope of evidence, the entire dealings between the employer and the employee would be available to the Government and its proof in all trust funds, in all subsequent breaches of them could be brought within the ambit of 302, which should be clearly contrary to the obvious intent of Congress in now dealing with taking up grappling and attempting legislation to cover this whole subject of misuse for personal benefit of trust fund moneys.</text>

            <text syncTime="548.619" offset="2297814">And as a matter of fact petitioner as president of his union local has served as chief negotiator for the union and a Mr. Goyco has served as negotiator for the employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.185" offset="2344103">Now, there were two employers, but they were operated as one enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.707" offset="2358209">And they had been negotiating since 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.068" offset="2371688">There had been a previous contract entered into for the year 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.768" offset="2390392">That contract provided for the establishment of a welfare fund in the sum of $15,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.649" offset="2417977">The previous fund was to be dispensed under joint control by a committee.</text>

            <text syncTime="590.486" offset="2465311">It had been deposited in a bank account established in the Bank of Ponce, Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.458" offset="2493210">That bank account was still in existence and two signatures, one for the union and one for the employer were required to draw checks against that account.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.588" offset="2533752">Now, when they were negotiating this new contract, the question came up as to who was to serve on the disbursement committee for this welfare fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.239" offset="2572309">At that time, petitioner affirmatively stated that he wanted to be the union representative on this disbursing committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.774" offset="2606477">Now, he had been the representative on the previous committee as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.075" offset="2619643">And so, that was no novelty.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.130" offset="2627897">But this, we claim, as a false representation, because it, at least, it clearly indicated to the employer that he was willing to accept the principle of joint control over this fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.328" offset="2672724">And that was the only basis upon which the fund could be established and that was one of the things which the employer have in mind when returned the check over to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.180" offset="2704071">Now, there is a second item here.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.918" offset="2715042">At the time the contract was signed, the previous year, the welfare fund had been deposited by a representative of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.798" offset="2746598">However, petitioner stated that he wanted to show the checks to a meeting of the employees to be held that evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.838" offset="2778676">And he agreed to deposit those checks in the then existing welfare fund bank account in the Bank of Ponce, Puerto Rico.</text>

            <text syncTime="712.448" offset="2953174">Now, instead of depositing those checks in the then existing bank account, he took those checks to a different bank, the National City Bank of Ponce, Puerto Rico, and he opened a new account.</text>

            <text syncTime="758.129" offset="3135927">Now, we showed, the Government proved that trial, presented evidence from which the jury could infer that that resolution was spurious, from beginning to last.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.499" offset="3177409">The meeting of the board of directors which purportedly had passed that resolution never took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.969" offset="3199248">There were two signatures appearing on that resolution at the time it was introduced in evidence, one was petitioners', one was -- belonged to a Silvagnoli, the union secretary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1761.736" offset="7150320">And so he took the balance now over into some $9800 and he put that in a general union account.</text>

            <text syncTime="1773.735" offset="7198281">He paid off -- he paid for a refrigerator which he had purchased and he paid for a household furnishing and then he bought some furniture equipment for union officers and diverted -- diverted it in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.823" offset="7250631">And then eventually, he comingled it with general union funds, so that became a loss, of course, forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.744" offset="7282395">Now -- well, shortly after he did that, he called it -- he expelled the union -- the union secretary from the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.983" offset="7323355">The union secretary was normally required to draw checks against general union funds, you see.</text>

            <text syncTime="1824.597" offset="7401723">And thereafter, he did draw upon general union funds into which the -- the balance of the welfare fund had been forged.</text>

            <text syncTime="1927.501" offset="7813413">Well that -- there -- that takes us directly to the legislative history of Section 302 (b) and it was well laid out there on the floor of the Senate to try and put it as briefly as I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.960" offset="7879241">Section 302 came in to the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.108" offset="7891780">Well, at first arose in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.806" offset="7902647">At that time we just had a steel strike, a General Motors strike and United Mine Workers were then on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.039" offset="7927515">And one of the contentions of the United Mine Workers was this, they refused to negotiate further until the operators agreed to pay a royalty of 10 cents a ton, on every ton of coal mined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.517" offset="7973491">Now, Mr. Lewis stated this money is to go into a fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.783" offset="7986552">That fund will be used to pay pensions, to pay welfare, medical benefits and to provide educational aid to minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.496" offset="8021347">Now, Mr. -- Senator Byrd offered an amendment to the case bill which was pending at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.739" offset="8050291">And case bill was designed to amend the National Labor Relations Act and he said, “Well, we want to forbid this kind of payment unless there's some sort of control over it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.070" offset="8091669">And after much discussion, it was agreed that they should authorize welfare funds, but that some sort of control should be provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.109" offset="8123852">Senator Ball offered an amendment to Byrd's original amendment which cast Section 302 in almost exactly the form which it has today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.865" offset="8162826">And he said at that time and we quote on page 21 of our brief, he said at that time, "That if they weren't very careful, these welfare funds might be used for organizational activities or something of that sort."</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.454" offset="8245164">And as he said, after all, Mr. Lewis might regard that as educational aid to miner -- to mining industry or to miners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.264" offset="8280377">Now, here's a clear case where he -- where he envision the giving of the money for a proper purpose, that is a welfare fund purpose, but accepted with a hidden intent to use it for something else, to use it for organizational activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.534" offset="8341504">And similarly, of course, Section 302 then passed as far as the case bill was vetoed by the President and in 1947, when the Taft-Hartley Act was passed, Senator Ball again offered, 302 from the floor of the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.522" offset="8405452">And at that time he stated that he wanted to ensure unless we -- on page 23 of our brief, this is a statement with which he introduced Section 302 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.628" offset="8453935">Unless we make sure that such funds, welfare funds, when they are established, are really trust funds -- trust funds and are actually used for the benefit to employees specified in the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.921" offset="8507016">There is a very grave danger that the funds will be used for the personal gain of union leaders or for political purposes or other purposes not contemplated when they are -- when they are established.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.202" offset="8556231">Now, this -- clearly here, he envisioned the case where the money is given for a proper welfare purpose, but accepted with a secret intent to use it for another and improper purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.977" offset="8611297">And Congress specifically intended to require that both parties must intend to establish a welfare fund before this payment would be lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.619" offset="8653824">Now, Senator Ball's comments are not the isolated comments of simply one senator from the floor of the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.622" offset="8681827">And similarly, Senator Byrd and Senator Noland and Senator Taft, their remarks which we have set forth in considerable detail, which I've attempted to summarize very hurriedly here, are far more persuasive than you -- than in the usual case because these Senators proposed 302 as an amendment to the case bill in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.303" offset="8772629">They protested the omission of 302 from the committee bill of the Senate in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.910" offset="8803035">They offered 302 from the floor of Senate in 1947 and got it accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.206" offset="8824247">They prevailed upon the House to receive in 1947 and - and accepted in the conference bill as they put across the whole Taft-Hartley Act toward the President's veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.780" offset="8866461">Now, these are not isolated comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.438" offset="8873148">These are the statements of the men who did the most to put 302 into the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.101" offset="8891747">They demanded mutual -- they demanded that both parties act honestly and with an honest purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.585" offset="8921736">And the fact that the employer thought he was contributing to a bonafide trust fund is not controlling in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2594.991" offset="10483336">He gave a charge which submitted this issue to the jury saying that, "If the employer, in delivering money, deliver -- delivers it for the exclusive purpose of creating a fund, the representative receiving that money, must have the same objective in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.218" offset="10552195">Now, if his objective is different and if he gets hold of the money and does not comply with the provisions of this section as to the fund, then he cannot claim of what the employer said must guide you, you must be guided simply by what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.519" offset="10605484">What were the circumstances under which this money came in to the possession of the defendant?</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.533" offset="10625546">If you believe that from the time the defendant received said sum of money from the employers, he had complete and sole control of said money in violation of the collective bargaining agreement -- agreement and the law and utilize such money or any part of it for his personal benefit, then I charge you that the defendant has violated the above mentioned section of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.590" offset="10721782">Now, here, the entire context -- sometimes he uses the word, "control", sometimes he uses the word, "motives", sometimes he uses the word, "intent".</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.644" offset="10757935">But so far as he uses motive and intent, he means the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.637" offset="10773922">And that, I think, is shown by the context of his remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.245" offset="10796387">And he submitted to the jury the sole question that there is in this case and we contend that question is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.204" offset="10832227">We say that the evidence to show that from the negotiation of this contract onward from that very moment on, petitioner had no intention to do anything except get hold of that money for his personal use and that he never did anything except things that enabled him to get that personal control over the funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.806" offset="10914565">And that was a theory upon which this case went to the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2755.623" offset="11125844">Because the Government's theory of this case varied somewhat from the lower court toward appeal, my brief in all aspects doesn't need it, so I would like to take this time to point out the principal reasons why we feel this theory of this is not apt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.635" offset="11189896">The first one, I renew my argument that the instructions do not support the Government's contention that the case was submitted to the jury on an intent basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.406" offset="11228975">I've said during my argument that the word was never used once, with reference to the defendant's conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.270" offset="11252485">The word was read by Mr. Grimm as objective, intend as a word of art in the criminal law and if the judge had intended to submit it on that basis, he was -- he would've used that intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.828" offset="11294699">The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit did not consider that the case was submitted to the jury on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.480" offset="11317269">So, I don't think it's supported by the record below this theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.643" offset="11329912">In the lower court, the Government had a different theory, this theory of control, if the defendant had complete and sole control over the fund, then this crime was brought within the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.415" offset="11368991">Here, we're told the intent -- the theory is intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.088" offset="11379754">It's not supported by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.920" offset="11387068">The second point I'd like to make is that the Government's reading of the legislative history is -- is not supported by the statutory analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.986" offset="11423326">One of the purposes Congress was obviously concerned with would be the union leader who took the money, pay to the welfare fund and then later decided to divert it without any contemporaneous intent decided to divert it to political purposes or the strike fund purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.860" offset="11486856">Under the Government's theory, you couldn't reach that man even though Congress was obviously concerned with him because he didn't have the contemporaneous intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.727" offset="11518307">The Government's theory puts everything upon the man having the intent to use it for the unprescribed purpose at the time he received the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.158" offset="11547982">Surely, we should not attribute to Congress an intent in 302 which wouldn't begin to reach the bulk of the cases which the Congress obviously had in mind in enacting that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.432" offset="11589151">That's why the position or the reading of the statute and its framework which we contend for, is the only one who accomplished it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.526" offset="11613497">Namely, that these events which happened after the payment and receipt, are to be taken cared of by the equity powers and the federal jurors in the federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.717" offset="11646203">Mr. Justice Brennan's question referred to a violation of say the arbitration agreement, provision for appointment of a neutral arbitrator, provision for the appointment of an annual audit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.953" offset="11687163">Surely, all of these things which could only happen after the event could not retroactively make the payment and receipt illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.279" offset="11712449">The Congress was looking there to the equity powers on the civil side of the federal court to cure the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.561" offset="11733661">And they were not looking to these crimes of misuse for personal purposes even with intent at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.839" offset="11758738">And they are now looking to that subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.927" offset="11767097">They have drafted the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.541" offset="11773576">It seems with -- on the eve of passage in some form or another which would clearly cover the case, there was no reason to stretch this statute and this is certainly a stretching to cover the facts of this case.</text>
