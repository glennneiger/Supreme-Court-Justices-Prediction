            <label>Mr. E. D. Vickery</label>
            <text syncTime="14.209" offset="56738">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.438" offset="73665">This case arises out of a shipment of a cargo of Carbon Black from the ports of New Orleans, Louisiana, and Houston, Texas to four different ports in Italy; Genoa, Naples, Venice, and Trieste.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.043" offset="140121">The shipment was made aboard petitioner's vessel, the Monrosa.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.114" offset="160392">Petitioner is an Italian steamship company.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.924" offset="179618">During the course of the vessel's voyage to Italy while the vessel was in the Atlantic Ocean, one of the plates in one of the cargo holes gave way and permitted seawater to enter into the vessel's hole.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.007" offset="235938">As a consequence, all of the carbon black in one of the holes of the vessel was damaged by the seawater.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.858" offset="267389">Although it was all -- it was destined for four separate ports in Italy.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.864" offset="291422">The force -- the first port of call was Genoa, as it was all damaged, it was all discharged at Genoa as it would be impossible to make substantial delivery in the other three Italian ports.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.679" offset="354638">The liable was instituted against the vessel in rem and against the petitioner in personam in the United States District Court in Houston praying for damages somewhat in excess of $100,000 by virtue of this damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.559" offset="422139">As a warrant of seizure was issued for the vessel and the vessel placed under arrest by the marshal, petitioner of necessity posted the necessary corporate surety bond to secure the release of the vessel so it could continue in its normal operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.057" offset="504163">A claim of the owner was also filed at this time as it is usual and customary and admiralty, and maritime matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.621" offset="534465">Because the contract of carriage, the bill of lading, the bills of lading rather, some 27 in number insofar as they relate to this particular cause of action had a cause in them which provided that no legal proceedings for the recovery of loss or damage to this cargo should be instituted except in the courts of Genoa, Italy.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.221" offset="632790">For this reason, the petitioners filed a motion to decline jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.888" offset="659540">In filing this motion, the petitioners did not contest or question the basic admiralty jurisdiction of the United States District Court in Houston.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.535" offset="702067">The jurisdiction of the Court, both in personam and in rem is admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.886" offset="723487">There is no question with respect to basic jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.503" offset="741982">However, the petitioner requested the District Court to decline to hear this litigation because the agreement made to litigate claims in Genoa, Italy was not and an unreasonable one and that in fact, the only reasonable forum for the adjudication of this controversy was in the courts of Italy, the agreed upon forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.089" offset="856294">The District Court granted this motion and declined jurisdiction, upon its finding that the agreement was not an unreasonable one.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.296" offset="901120">It required the respondent in the District Court and the petitioners here, however, to give appropriate security to the libelant in the total amount of the initial bond of $100,000 conditioned that the petitioner would pay any judgment that might be awarded by the Italian courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.757" offset="1002998">This was to protect the security which the respondent was able to obtain upon a seizure of the vessel in Houston.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.166" offset="1040614">So, insofar as a security for its loss, if it is able to establish liability, the respondent has full security as if the case were pending in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.338" offset="1093277">The Court, in granting this motion, relied on a decision from the Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit, the William H. Muller case by which we shall talk at some length further in the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.160" offset="1160568">The Court, however, went somewhat further then the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit require in the Muller case when it required the posting of a corporate surety bond to protect the security which the respondent had obtained by issuing a warrant of seizure against the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.716" offset="1250847">When the matter was taken before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, that Court remanded the case to the District Court primarily on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.469" offset="1305809">First of all, that the agreement to adjudicate claims in Genoa, Italy only was void as contrary to public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.064" offset="1344157">And secondly, on the grounds that the agreement in the contract of carriage, the bill of lading, was not sufficient to cover in rem actions against the vessel itself as well as in personam actions against the owners of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.897" offset="1435585">So, we turned first to the question of whether or not an agreement such as this, upon a particular forum for the litigation of any controversies that might arise with respect to a particular shipment of cargo, aboard a foreign vessel, is valid and enforceable or whether it is as the Court of Appeals below held contrary to the public policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="450.255" offset="1800986">The only Act of Congress that relates to this problem is the United States' Carriage of Goods by Sea Act which was passed in 1936.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.360" offset="1837349">It -- it's exactly the same almost word for word for the so-called Brussels Convention which was an international agreement with respect to Carriage of Goods by Sea Act and almost all maritime nations have now ratified that -- that particular convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.697" offset="1910700">Now, insofar as the question of whether or not this matter was considered by Congress at the time the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act was passed, which I assume that's what Mr. Justice Black is getting at.</text>

            <label>Mr. E. D. Vickery</label>
            <text syncTime="498.149" offset="1992516">The only proposals that I know of to amend the acts with respect to jurisdiction of controversy such as this have arisen in the proceedings before the Maritime Law Association of the United States, which is of course an organization of admiralty and maritime lawyers and in the application for the writ of certiorari which we filed, we put excerpts from the -- from the proceedings before the Maritime Law Association and in those a specific -- a specific wording of the statute was suggested in a majority report I believe by Mr. Longley, the amicus curiae and the Court permitted to file a brief yesterday in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.128" offset="2172447">He suggested that the Maritime Law Association sponsor a bill in Congress to expressly make such clauses as this invalid and void.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.406" offset="2217587">And at the meeting, I believe, it was November of 1957, if my recollection served me correctly, the Maritime Law Association voted that proposal down by vote of 70 to 30 or something as I recall the vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.346" offset="2273384">It was a -- those meetings do not constitute a very substantial portion of the membership of the association but that was the action at that particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.431" offset="2325629">Now, with respect to whether Congress has considered such clauses as this and whether or not the Congress has given us any expression on these particular clauses, we have only the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act to go by and we can only look at certain portions of the legislative history because it does not appear that these jurisdictional clauses or these clauses to litigate claims in a particular forum were specifically considered by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.792" offset="2451122">The only indication we have that Congress was aware of agreement such as this is contained in the fact that they were very conscious about following the Brussels Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.735" offset="2502844">They were very conscious of being uniformed in the enactment of the United States Carriage of Goods by Sea Act insofar as all of the acts in other maritime countries were concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.554" offset="2558119">They were also aware and the legislative history amply reflects this, that the Australian Carriage of Goods by Sea Act and the Canadian Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, both contains provisions which prohibited such agreements as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.944" offset="2623739">Now then, Canada has since amended its Act and has taken out the prohibition which eliminates -- which prohibited agreements such as this and its Act, and it was doing that at approximately the same time that the Congress of the United States was considering the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.884" offset="2699494">Now, with respect to that, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in considering the Muller case, expressly states that had Congress intended for agreement such as this to be invalid and they intended to adopt in effect the minority rule of Canada and Australia rather than the majority rule of the rest of the maritime nations which permitted such agreements then the second -- the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit says they would have done it in plain and unequivocal language that they wouldn't have left it to implication.</text>

            <text syncTime="966.826" offset="3867272">Now then, in considering the question of public policy and why Congress might not have thought it appropriate to include such a specific agreement as this, I have already mentioned to the Court first of all the Congress is concern that we have uniformity among the maritime nations and their adoption of what I would call the majority rule of such agreement as this were not excluded in the acts, but there is still another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.166" offset="4004571">There is still another reason behind Congress' action in this regard as I see it and that would be Congress' desire to encourage American shippers to ship on American ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.773" offset="4063086">Now, if American shippers are interested in litigating any claims they might have for loss or damage to their cargo, which are being shipped abroad, they in effect have a choice by shipping on American ships they can sue in American courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.696" offset="4134766">If they want to ship on foreign ships and the foreigners say, “In return for your shipping on my ship, I am requiring you to agree to litigate your claims in Italy,” then they ought to be relegated to the courts of Italy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.378" offset="4193489">And in this particular case, there is no question about what the -- about what the respondent in this case had a choice or one of the largest American steamship companies in the country operate vessels out of these same ports, to the ports of Italy each two weeks, every month out of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.544" offset="4270080">So, it's not a question of the respondent having to take this or not having any choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1680.215" offset="6720784">At the beginning of the voyage, there are two possible sources of evidence on that particular issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.113" offset="6748369">First of all, insofar as the ship owner is concerned, it will have to rely primarily on the testimony of the master and the chief mate of the vessel itself on that particular issue because they were the men who were charged with the ultimate responsibility for making whatever inspections were necessary with respect to the seaworthiness of the vessel while it was away from its home territory and its home port.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.195" offset="6852754">Now then, there is possible -- there is possibly another witness or two in Houston or in New Orleans, which might have some evidence to give in this case if a question of proper or improper stowage comes up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.194" offset="6916702">The facts as I know them, there is not any question that stowage involved and unless there is a question of proper and improper stowage, I don't contemplate the necessity of any witnesses at all in either Houston or New Orleans, but at best on just a part -- part of the evidence on this one half of the respondent's burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.060" offset="6996219">It's possibly available in the ports of New Orleans and Houston.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.608" offset="7014400">Now the other issue in the case, all of the evidence is available only in Italy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.349" offset="7045329">That is with respect to the amount of damages to which the respondents would be entitle if petitioners are liable for the loss and damage which has occurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="1787.768" offset="7150968">They also have to establish the nature and the extent of the laws in what the value of the cargo was in its damaged condition and I think if that there is a -- may possibly based on experts in this country that the Court might permit to testify with respect to market value in Italy, but primarily, your market value on the date of the arrival of the vessel would have to come from my Italian sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.031" offset="7260056">So, as I see it, all of the evidence in connection with the two issues that are really involved in this case except possibly for a witness or two in Houston or in New Orleans is -- is obtainable primarily in Italy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1859.593" offset="7438315">They had surveyors present at the time that a cargo arrived.</text>

            <text syncTime="1872.099" offset="7488366">Of course, we have some translation problems involved somewhere along the line whether the case is tried in America or is tried in Italy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.881" offset="7523474">Something is going to have to be translated, but I submit that with substantially all of the evidence coming from my Italian witnesses that the translations that would be necessary would be substantially greater in the United States than in Italy, or as I see the matter, primarily, the only translation to be involved would be of the bill of lading.</text>
