            <label>Mr. Seymour Schwartz</label>
            <text syncTime="18.533" offset="177507">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.799" offset="186598">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.198" offset="204152">This is an appeal in forma pauperis from a judgment of the District Court in the Southern District of New York dismissing the complaint of petitioner, Glus.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.775" offset="258487">Petitioner Glus brought his action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.829" offset="290670">In his complaint, he alleged that because of the fraud or misrepresentation of his employer, the respondent, Brooklyn Eastern District Terminal, he was in effect kept from bringing his action within the three-year statutory period of limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.306" offset="380635">And that for that reason should be permitted to bring this action nevertheless.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.519" offset="409475">The respondent moved by motion to dismiss plaintiff's complaint and an order dismissing that complaint was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.201" offset="452211">No answer by respondent was entered, no testimony was taken, and the petitioner had no opportunity to have any pretrial procedure such as interrogatories or depositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.326" offset="508635">The facts in the matter are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.830" offset="526712">In July 1946, the petitioner, Glus, began employment with the Brooklyn Eastern District Terminal as a freight handler.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.924" offset="571120">His job predominantly was to unload bags of flour from freight cars which came into the terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.841" offset="602781">Those bags of flour in various sizes were covered with paper, sometimes with some material.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.486" offset="641337">In any event, there was a good deal of flour dust in and about the area of work where Glus was employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.523" offset="673416">There were no safety devices or masks issued to those employees working with the flour, and after being subject to these working conditions for a number of years, in 1951, Glus discovered that he was having a good deal of difficulty breathing.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.815" offset="750634">He brought this to the attention of his employers and he was seen by the company doctor at their request and his.The company doctor, after examination, suggested that Glus be assigned to light duty instead of being assigned to unloading the flour.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.613" offset="829837">However, his foreman did not permit this new assignment and he was continued with the job that he had performed up to that time as a freight handler working on flour.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.992" offset="887306">In the years 1951 and 1952, Glus made various complaints to his foreman, the General Superintendent of the Brooklyn Eastern District Terminal, and the claim agent of Brooklyn Eastern District Terminal asserting his condition and stating that he desire other work.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.068" offset="975600">He was told by these three people that his condition was not as serious as he would make out and that if in fact it was serious at all, he still had seven years within which to bring his action against his employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.822" offset="1050624">I might parenthetically add that the Brooklyn Eastern District Terminal employs men who are under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, under the Jones Act, under the Longshoreman's Act and under the State Workmen's Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.433" offset="1113109">And it's quite possible that even attorneys at times might have difficulty in ascertaining exactly what Act covers a particular employee at a particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.519" offset="1165458">In any event, in July 1952, Glus had a serious attack of asthmatic bronchitis and he received welfare assistance from the City of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.367" offset="1220838">He went to the Greenpoint Hospital as a charity patient in Brooklyn and there, he was told for the first time that he was suffering from asthmatic bronchitis and that this condition was permanent and progressive.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.473" offset="1281233">He was last able to work for the Brooklyn Eastern District Terminal in January 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.689" offset="1310177">And since March 1953, he has been employed by the Norcross Corporation in New York, which is a card firm, in their warehouse doing light work in decent working conditions which do not debilitate him too much.</text>

            <text syncTime="2146.913" offset="8691022">Well, Judge Wyzanski, as far as I know, and to some extent, (Inaudible) in the first of the three Scarboroughs, but Judge Wyzanski very specifically said, “Why, this is not new, this is old.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.542" offset="8761553">But we have cited not only text writers but the Supreme Courts of many of the States and Justice Holmes in a -- on oblique reference to the newness of FELA in a 1916 case in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.774" offset="8822471">What Judge Wyzanski was trying to do, I think, and what Scarborough was trying to do on this issue, was to refute or to disclaim an ancient theory which is bound up with a litigation on these cases, namely, this is brand new at the law, this never existed at the common law, and when Congress gives this legislation, which is beneficial and beneficent, it prescribes the rules of the game, and because the argument was that it wasn't new and in only those two cases have I seen that statement made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.054" offset="8951620">If I can proceed to state in just capsule form the theme of my argument from which I voluntarily distracted myself, long before FELA in 1908, the traditional distinction was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.426" offset="9001044">We cited the texts between general and special statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.438" offset="9017135">General statutes are the ordinary ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.797" offset="9026539">They relate to rights already existing at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.745" offset="9042317">Special statutes are considered to be those which are contained in such a statute, as FELA, which create the right in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.597" offset="9085785">Now, from the outset, the courts construed FELA as containing a special statute of limitations only and one which was subject to no exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.276" offset="9140433">There have been exceptions, I didn't mean to imply that there aren't, but not Justice Frankfurter in -- in cases of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.508" offset="9169377">The -- the classic exceptions are those which come out of a Civil War case in this Court where the Supreme Court of the United States took an ancient maxim of one of the European writers who said that if -- if the -- the prescription shouldn't bind someone when he doesn't have a form available to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.729" offset="9246281">And so, in cases where -- there are cases we cite into on our brief where the plaintiff was interned one day after Pearl Harbour and comes back and the statute has run.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.273" offset="9288495">In that type of case, there have been breaks, chinks in the armor, one of the judges called in the so-called impregnability of the doctrine for which we speak here today.</text>

            <text syncTime="2476.382" offset="10008952">Now, addressing myself briefly to point one, I remake the point that before 1908, this distinction was exceptionally well-known.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.227" offset="10064332">The courts use all kinds of language to refer to these statutes, built-in, substantive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.543" offset="10085543">But without exception, the courts held that the statutes, not this type before 1908, but debt actions and will contests which we cite in our brief, that those statutes were not extendable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.738" offset="10146356">In a case in this Court in 1886, the Harrisburg which we've cited, this sentence appears.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.584" offset="10177703">It is the -- this Court's characterization of two debt statutes, one in Massachusetts and one in Pennsylvania, and here it is, “The time within which the suit must be brought operates as a limitation of the liability as created and not of the remedy alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.967" offset="10243218">It is a condition attached to the right to sue at all.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.923" offset="10259101">I cite this only for its general usage in the approach to this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.014" offset="10283447">Now, in the mid-1880's, when statutes of limitations generally were growing in the 48 States, at first, the courts showed a marked diversity to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.588" offset="10333706">But later, as we point out in the brief, with cases and with text citations, the courts began to enforce them literally and where exceptions were not found in the statutes the courts putting on in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.261" offset="10388459">In 1908, this body of law was extensive and so we argue that the Congress knew it or is presumed to have known it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.419" offset="10425031">We point out that in Central Vermont against White, which we cite and which was decided in this Court in 1915, on another question, namely, “Where is the burden of proof under this Act when there is a debt?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.211" offset="10476231">This Court said that in enacting FELA, the Congress, knowing the decisional law on the question of burden of proof, must have intended that FELA be construed in the light of that decisional law.</text>
