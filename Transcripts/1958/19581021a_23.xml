            <text syncTime="7.125" offset="131845">Mr. Morrow, you may continue your argument.</text>

            <label>Mr. George E. Morrow</label>
            <text syncTime="10.030" offset="143444">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.901" offset="162983">Yesterday there was a question from the bench to the effect can Natural Gas Companies change their rates by any means to their customers without the customer's consent under our theory of this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.740" offset="218363">And the answer of which I gave was “No,” in solely in the reference of Section 4 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.759" offset="250441">Now, it is of course quite clear that Natural Gas Companies can change their rights -- their rates without their customer's consent even their contract rates anytime that they can convince the Commission that they deserve an increase in proceedings under Section 5 (a) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.974" offset="331316">That is the remedy which this Court said in the Mobile case was always available to a Natural Gas Company, whose rates were too low to enable it, to carry on its public service functions properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.462" offset="389204">Now, the answer to that question leads me into maybe putting my last chapter first as it were so that I can explain to the Court just what we are driving at, just what the system of regulation under Section 4 and 5 of the Act was intended to be by Congress as we see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.472" offset="485230">I think it becomes clear from what I've already said just now, that the only issue in this case is whether United should have filed under or should have applied for a rate increase under Section 5 of the Act instead of as it did under Section 4 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.330" offset="560671">There's no question that if United had a need for a rate increase that it could get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.108" offset="583764">The only question is whether it could get it under Section 5 or under Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.423" offset="605080">Now, what's the difference?</text>
            <text syncTime="126.623" offset="609886">What's the practical difference between these two procedures?</text>
            <text syncTime="130.963" offset="627231">Well, Section 5 of the Act is an administrative procedure whereby the Federal Power Commission in its role as the protector of the consumer interest, the public interest investigates the rate of a Natural Gas Company to determine whether that rate conforms to the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.557" offset="709569">And if the rate does not conform to the public interest, then the Federal Power Commission issues an order at the conclusion of the proceedings which modifies the rate to make it conform.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.850" offset="766725">And the new rate thus modified goes into effect from and after the date of the final order in the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.203" offset="800162">Now, the principal difference under Section 4 has to do with the refund procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.247" offset="828374">Under Section 4 of the Act the Commission also exercises the same rate review power which it exercised under Section 5, but it -- and -- and it's reviewing the existing rates of Natural Gas Companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.122" offset="907891">The only difference --</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="201.585" stopTime="212.970">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="201.585" offset="909667">No, you're talk about the factual difference, it does not matter (Inaudible) what is the difference if any in time making (Inaudible) for proceeding exercises.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="george_e_morrow" startTime="212.970" stopTime="287.259">
            <label>Mr. George E. Morrow</label>
            <text syncTime="212.970" offset="955225">That's exactly what I'm getting to Your Honor, right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.902" offset="967032">The difference is the time when the rate goes into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.844" offset="990751">Under a Section 4 proceeding, if the Commission suspends the rate, then it goes into effect five months later.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.383" offset="1020949">At least it goes into provisional effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.431" offset="1033070">It's a sort of a pendente lite effect because at the end of the proceedings, the Commission again, after having fully considered the rate, again issues its order might find the rate to conform to the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.694" offset="1106108">But there, its order had made retroactive by this refund procedure, because if the rate which is filed is higher than it ought to be according to the Commission's final order, then the excess has to be scrapped off and refunded to the customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.550" offset="1169533">So, that the effect is that you've only had one rate in effect all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.532" offset="1189491">So, the difference between -- practical difference between Section 5 and Section 4, is that the rate goes into effect earlier in a Section 4 proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.974" offset="1231287">It's what you might call a quicker proceeding and Section 5 the slower proceeding.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="287.259" offset="1252394">How long does the effect (Inaudible)?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="george_e_morrow" startTime="293.781" stopTime="694.339">
            <label>Mr. George E. Morrow</label>
            <text syncTime="293.781" offset="1278516">Your Honor has again gotten right to the point ahead on me.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.409" offset="1300982">Section 5 proceedings historically have taken a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.805" offset="1322611">The Commission in its brief cites horrible examples up to five years or six years in which it has taken, but I submit Your Honor that Section 5 proceedings need not take that long.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.409" offset="1369004">You see, as Chairman Kuykendall of the Commission has pointed out since the decision in the lower court, if a Section 5 proceeding is being used -- well, let me put it this way, up to this time, Section 5 proceedings have only being used to decrease the rates of Natural Gas Companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.796" offset="1450506">So, that the decreased rate does not go into effect until the end of the Section 5 proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.805" offset="1478614">Well, quite obviously, the Natural Gas Company is not anxious for the proceeding to end.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.505" offset="1505364">As -- as Mr. Kuykendall, Chairman of the Commission said the pipelines have been running away from the Commission in these five-day proceedings up to now.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.089" offset="1543711">And he points out that there might be -- that it might be possible to process them in a very much shorter time where the pipeline company wants an increase and is running with the Commission cooperating with the Commission staff in every way and working to get the -- the proceedings to a conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.674" offset="1634095">Nevertheless, even in that sort of a situation, the chances are that a Section 5 proceeding, the rate is still the slower proceeding of the two, the rate goes into effect later.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.603" offset="1685817">Now, this brings me down to -- to really what we're aiming at.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.109" offset="1707760">What we are asking is what we think Congress intended was nothing more than a fair break to the Natural Gas Company and the distributor company.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.960" offset="1755199">We expect -- we -- we think that Congress intended to put them on the same procedural level.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.684" offset="1782157">Here's what I mean by that.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.589" offset="1793755">Up until this time, Section 5 (a) has always been the proceeding by which a customer can get a decrease in rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.957" offset="1843179">Section 5 (a) specifically provides that a Natural Gas Company which thinks it's rates are too high can go to the Commission and -- in effect, this what happen – happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.596" offset="1889782">The company goes to the Commission and says, “Mr. Commission, we are bound by a long-term contract without natural gas supplier and these rates we think are too high.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.237" offset="1936280">They're not in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.196" offset="1944116">Won't you Mr. Commission exercise your regulatory jurisdiction, investigate these rates and if you find that too high, won't you give us relief in the public interest regardless of our contracts because you've got the paramount power over those in the public interest.”</text>
            <text syncTime="480.575" offset="2025723">Now under a Section 5 proceeding as illuminated by the Mobile case, the Natural Gas Company which wants an increase can do exactly the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.727" offset="2078281">It also goes to the Commission and says, “Mr. Commission, we are bound by our long-term contracts with our customers” and may I pause to say that there's nothing involved in this case except long-term contracts, but all of the United jurisdictional contracts are long-term contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.788" offset="2166575">“We are bound by our long-term contracts to our jurisdictional costumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.890" offset="2186951">We think we deserve an increase but our customer won't agree to that increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.317" offset="2204609">Now, won't you Mr. Commission” says the pipeline, “Won't you investigate our present existing rates and if you find that they are so low, that they are not -- that they interfere with our ability to carry out our public utility function, won't you grant us the right to increase those rates,” filed under Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.174" offset="2292067">Now, you see in that way, for the first time, the public -- that the Natural Gas Pipeline Company and the distributor company are placed on exactly the same procedural point.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.121" offset="2359881">The distributor company's right to a decrease is just as great, just as firm as the -- in -- in a case where it deserves it as the Natural Gas Company's right to an increase is in the case where the Natural Gas Company deserves it.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.325" offset="2444622">So all this does, this proceeding that we think United should have taken, all it does is to put the pipelines on the same procedural plane with the distributor, the distributor who directly serves the consumer, the consumer, who is the darling of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.560" offset="2533648">The consumer who's protection was the primary purpose of the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.690" offset="2558098">That's all we are asking this Court to decide in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.786" offset="2574503">That when there has been no agreed upon increase between the pipeline and its contract costumers, they go under Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.171" offset="2616090">When there has been no agreed upon decrease, between the pipeline and its contract costumer, the customer goes in under Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.410" offset="2652975">Now, that -- that makes everything in the Act fall into place.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.539" offset="2665514">It gives everything a reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.360" offset="2680769">For instance, let's take the same thing over to Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.270" offset="2700413">There, Congress has an effect said, “Let the utilities see if they can work it out first.”</text>
            <text syncTime="658.585" offset="2737716">Now, if the two utility companies can get together on a rate increase, if the pipeline can convince its costumer that it's entitled to a rate increase and the costumer agrees to it, then you've got an agreed upon rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.355" offset="2788812">Then the pipeline can file that new agreed upon rate with the Commission under Section 4 in the quicker proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.328" offset="2812635">Or by the same token, if the costumer convinced the pipeline that the pipeline's rate is too high, then you agree upon a lower rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.529" offset="2853491">And the lower rate goes into effect under Section 4 in the quicker procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.988" offset="2875329">Now, this makes sense.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="694.339" stopTime="719.735">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="694.339" offset="2880763">Supposing that the Congress accept the Commissions (Inaudible) and they made adjusting their rates under Section 4 is certainly a refund for the -- would they be arguing now that nevertheless, the suppliers can only operate under Section 5 or --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="george_e_morrow" startTime="719.735" stopTime="1441.986">
            <label>Mr. George E. Morrow</label>
            <text syncTime="719.735" offset="2982327">Within a non-agreed upon increase, yes Your Honor because if that happened, it would simply put the industrial rates in the same category with all other rates and I've been talking about all the other rates up till now.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.398" offset="3044916">Now, let's see what sense that makes in terms of the Congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.808" offset="3074591">Here you have a situation where you have two public utilities dealing with each other, the pipeline and the distributor.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.280" offset="3104475">Now, Congress says that if these two public utilities can get together and agree upon a rate which they as between themselves think is reasonable and then file that rate with the Commission, isn't there a -- a reasonable warrant or basis or at least temporary presumption that that rate is reasonable?</text>
            <text syncTime="773.466" offset="3197262">And therefore, isn't it appropriate to allow the new rate to go into effect under barn so it's in effect while the Commission acting in it's capacity as protector of the public interest, the third party in interest to those contracts investigates this new completed contract to see whether it serves the public as it should.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.936" offset="3287124">On the other hand, suppose the two utility companies, the parties directly involved in the rate have not been able to get together on what they consider is a reasonable rate then isn't it reasonable that the new rates sought -- whether the higher rates sought by the pipeline or the lower rate sought by the costumer, the distributor, isn't it reasonable that the new rate should have to prove itself as it were in the course of the Commission proceedings before the Commission order makes it effective?</text>
            <text syncTime="832.471" offset="3433305">The whole Act begins to take form and shape and all we're asking, I repeat once more, is an even break for the distributor and the pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.682" offset="3490147">The distributor under this theory has the same rights to a decrease as -- as the pipeline does to an increase and this gives him correlative remedies to go along with those correlative rights, to a non--agreed upon right, correlative remedies under Section 4 to an agreed upon right.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.538" offset="3589517">Now, the question is raised about the ex parte rates and I like to quote from the Court's opinion just what was said in Mobile about this business of ex parte rates because a great deal has been said in the Commission's -- well, in all the briefs about it and I think that they have completely misunderstood the impact of what the Court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.149" offset="3699963">The Court was saying in Section, it was discussing in Section 4, the fact that the Natural Gas Act did not change the contractual powers of Natural Gas Companies, did not interfere with or changed the rate making or rate changing powers of Natural Gas Companies and it followed that up by this sentence which is found in page 343 of the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.630" offset="3801840">The obvious implication is that except as specifically limited by the Act, the rate making powers of Natural Gas Companies would be no different from those they would possess in the absence of the Act, it's in the (Inaudible), to establish ex parte and change at will rates offered to prospective customers or to fix by contract and change only by mutual agreement the rate agreed upon with a particular customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.357" offset="3968815">Now, which one of those alternatives do we fall under in this Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="972.893" offset="3994937">May it please the Court there is not a single prospective customer in the picture in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.365" offset="4024822">Every single customer is a long-term contract customer of United.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.253" offset="4052407">Therefore, we are obviously within the second alternative where United has no right to file an ex parte rate to us, but must fix by contract and change only by mutual agreement the rate which is agreed upon with these particular customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.974" offset="4155225">The Court also said, oh, and -- and let me pause there to say that it seemed to appear from the argument of opposing counsel that what we were trying to do was to demolish the Commission's regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.233" offset="4232338">Now, I grant that I said what Mr. Carson quoted me as saying that under the -- in the light of the Mobile decision, there might need to be some modifications of the Commission's regulations, but those are minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.671" offset="4294092">We have no quarrel with the general scope intent in purpose of the Commission's regulations as explained by General Rankin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.661" offset="4330036">Now, we do have quarrel with the message there set forth in the briefs but if you will recall, General Rankin said that the only purpose of the regulations was to take these sheets of contracts and he showed how thick it was, a lot of different complicated contracts which United had with all its customers and reduced it down to this much contract to put all of the contractual arrangements between the parties into a uniform format prescribed by the Commission and that was the only purpose of the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.300" offset="4492622">And that was the purpose that the Commission said at the time that promulgated the regulations as their only purpose and we quote them at 86 of our brief, "A presiding examiner's statement which was adopted in toto by the Commission."</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.817" offset="4566601">It said the Commission's purpose in promulgating Order Number 144, which of course promulgated these regulations, was precisely as it stated in its explanatory opinion therewith that the proposed amendment of the general rules and regulations was for the sole purpose of achieving uniformity and simplicity with respect to form, composition and filing of schedules of rights and charges for the transportation and sale for resale of Natural Gas in Interstate Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.198" offset="4684152">It was solely a matter of form, and as a matter of form, we have no quarrel with it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.991" offset="4707349">It was a splendid idea to get all of these complicated contracts down to a simple uniform format.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.490" offset="4745383">So, the -- the Commission's argument which it attempts to launch from its regulations on the basis of its regulations just simply won't stand up in the light of which the Commission has already said about those regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.828" offset="4826676">It's clear that actually what has happened in this case is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.619" offset="4857814">In the Mobile case, the Commission came to the Court saying United has a right to file this unilateral change in its contract because the Natural Gas Act, Section 4 of the Natural Gas Act by providing a rate changing procedure confers upon at that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.360" offset="4940779">That was the Commission's argument in Mobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.781" offset="4950497">And this Court said, "No, it's no such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.563" offset="4965648">Section 4 is not a rate changing procedure".</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.107" offset="4979754">Section 4 provides not for proposals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.077" offset="4995636">The scope of the Commission's review power under Section 4 is the same as it is under Section 5 to review the existing rates of Natural Gas Company and to make it crystal clear, the Court pointed out in Mobile that Section 4 provides no more than, let's see, provides no more than that otherwise valid rates, and if I may, here it's on page 339, it starts right at the bottom of 339.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.283" offset="5148505">In short, Section 4 (d) on its face indicates no more than that otherwise valid changes cannot be put into effect without giving the required notice to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.923" offset="5207019">Now, how does it change yet to be an otherwise valid change, it's between these two utility companies, very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.347" offset="5244740">Let's -- let's take for instance just to make it concrete, United and Mississippi Valley, United's customer company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.910" offset="5282983">Prior to the filing of the rate in this case by United, it had a long-term contract with Mississippi Valley and Mississippi was purchasing gas from it at a certain, specific, well understood, agreed upon price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.540" offset="5365530">Now, obviously, the price was the very heart of that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.716" offset="5382248">It was integral part of the contract and they were purchasing gas at a price which had been contracted for and agreed upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.330" offset="5416730">Now, United wants to substitute a new rate for the rate which they have agreed upon and have been observing for several years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.890" offset="5450898">How can it make that substituted rate valid?</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.186" offset="5472110">There's only one way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.646" offset="5481932">United has got to find somewhere, somehow an agreement on the part of its co-contractor to pay the substitute rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.829" offset="5542640">And that's why at the outset of this case of my argument here, I dwelt upon the fact that there has been no agreement on the part of Mississippi Valley, Texas Gas, Southern Natural, any other customer of United to pay the rate which United filed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.050" offset="5635532">The rate is not an otherwise valid rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.128" offset="5651832">The rate is nothing more than a proposal on the part of United which draws the Commission into the vortex of the rate controversy between these two public utility companies and that's the rate, I mean, that's under the contract as construed by United.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.947" offset="5731140">Actually, you might say our ultimate position in this case goes even deeper than that and that is that with effective superseding rate schedules provision cannot contain and cannot be interpreted to contain all of the tremendous volumes of significance which has been implied into it and inferred into it by the parties to this case and for that argument, I will turn it over to Mr. Goldberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.353" offset="5864782">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Reuben Goldberg</label>
            <text syncTime="1455.514" offset="5925386">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.338" offset="5940746">At the outset, I want to reemphasize, if I may, for a moment what Mr. Morrow has just said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.776" offset="5982438">I want to reemphasize that Mississippi, a contract purchaser of Natural Gas from United Gas Pipeline Company has a contract with United for the purchase of Natural Gas for a specified term of years at a specified price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.438" offset="6073135">The fact that the price is specified in the contract by reference to another document, a rate schedule in accordance with a format prescribed by the Commission's regulations to provide an easy means for the public of locating the rates involved and for the staff of the Commission in locating it, does not make that rate, we submit, any less a specified contract rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.153" offset="6191940">The rates specified by reference to the rate schedule is every bit as binding upon United and upon Mississippi as was the price in the Mobile contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.431" offset="6241050">The petitioners say, however, that there is a material difference between the Mobile contract, and the contract with Mississippi, and the contracts it has with the other pipeline petitioners in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.480" offset="6301341">The difference they argue lies in this effective superseding rate schedule provisions that innocent little phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.944" offset="6347107">That provision they say, implies an agreement on a rate change procedure a reservation by United of its right unilaterally to file a change in the contract rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.387" offset="6416906">And they say, “That's all we need under the Mobile decision to make the filing a valid filing eligible for filing under Section 4 (d) of the Act,” but we submit the provision does not mean what they claim for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.794" offset="6494542">The provision as the words given its ordinary made make clear, it's only explicit recognition that in a regulated industry the rate agreed upon by the parties is subject to the paramount power of the Commission to review it and to modify it while it is contrary to the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.591" offset="6593703">The legal effect of that language, is to make certain that when the Commission in the exercise of its paramount power reviews the rate and determines that it is either too high or too low depending what the case maybe that the seller and the buyer are both equally bound to continue to buy and sell gas under that contract under that new rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.292" offset="6704567">Thus, if the Court please --</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="1651.858" offset="6710836">That -- that would be so in quite in respect of this clause, isn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="reuben_goldberg" startTime="1655.532" stopTime="2008.137">
            <label>Mr. Reuben Goldberg</label>
            <text syncTime="1655.532" offset="6725465">I am not getting right to that if I may get it in to -- in the order my argument will take only a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.595" offset="6749706">The Mississippi's contract we say is therefore, exactly like the contract in the Mobile case, because what is explicitly stated in the effective superseding rate schedules provision was implicit in the Mobile contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.631" offset="6821909">As the Court recognized in Mobile, the Commission has the power, the paramount power to review that rate and to change it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.573" offset="6873631">And under the law, United would be obligated to sell at that rate and Mobile would be obligated to purchase at that rate because that modified rate under the law is therefore the effective superseding rate precisely what the provision in the contracts here involved talks about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.412" offset="6957014">Now, the petitioners contend that this construction that we put on that language reduces it to surplusage because they say, if you construe with the way you argue, it only says what the law is, but the provision not only says what the law is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.828" offset="7042696">It prevents a claim of illegality or impossibility that might be otherwise have been advanced by either of the parties if a rate ensued out of the exercise of the Commission's paramount power that perhaps they didn't care for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.177" offset="7120123">And it's not an uncommon thing to find in contracts provisions that do no more than state what the law is because they serve the very useful purpose of precluding contentions that might otherwise be advanced and a provision that serves such as purpose we submit is not surplusage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.973" offset="7215313">I would venture to say, and certainly my experience is pretty limited in that respect, but I would venture to say that if we can have a dollar for every contract that there is in this country that contains a provision that does nothing more than state what the law is for the very purpose I've indicated, I think we have a pretty large sum of money perhaps even large enough to make dent in the National Debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.013" offset="7331401">We submit that you can read that language in the contract over and over again and it'll be searched in vain for evidence of an agreement on a rate change procedure or a reservation on the part of United unilaterally to file a rate change in the contract rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.344" offset="7420740">There isn't any reference in the provision to Section 4 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.157" offset="7439966">There's no reference of the provision to Section 5 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.061" offset="7455640">There is no reference in that provision to anything that connotes a rate change procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.878" offset="7486882">The petitioners recognized this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.289" offset="7496495">They don't say that the provision expresses an agreement on a rate changing procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.983" offset="7527320">They say it is to be implied and I assume that means that the provision is ambiguous and needs construction and this is a reasonable implication of the provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.000" offset="7571414">We think it is neither to be reasonably implied nor found when it takes at least a paragraph to state what they claim for this little phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.677" offset="7626062">There's nothing in the language that that purports to say what is effective to change a rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.259" offset="7648423">There's nothing in it that even suggests under what circumstances a change can be made and there's certainly no agreement in it to pay any rate whatsoever or even an agreement that the mere act of filing will make the rate that United filed effective on the face of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.733" offset="7726268">We find in the agreement in the provision only an agreement to pay the effective and I emphasize effective, superseding rate and I emphasize effective because that provision is a limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.135" offset="7783946">It's a condition upon an obligation to pay any different rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.045" offset="7811532">We know in the Mobile case that rates are not effective superseding rate simply because the pipeline company has filed it to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.284" offset="7856462">In that case, United had filed a rate, the Commission had accepted it, it was treated by United and the Commission is effective, and Mobile even paid it, but this Court held that the filing was nullity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.733" offset="7926262">It was not an effective superseding rate because the Commission had exceeded its authority in accepting that filing since it was not an agreed upon change and United had exceeded its power to file it because it was not of that character.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.665" offset="8002017">And United is keenly aware of the lack of resemblance of the effective superseding rate schedules provision to this agreement on a rate change procedure or even a reservation of the right to file rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.136" offset="8071920">And they're keenly aware of the rule of contract construction that says that a contact is to be construed more strongly against the draftsman and of course for draftsman of the contract, its creator, its author is United.</text>

            <text syncTime="2311.709" offset="9350248">I -- I see Mr. Justice Frankfurter's point that even if it were agreement to pay any superseding rate, it would have to be an effective superseding rate that could be charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.643" offset="9409912">But the point I was trying to make was, that if the word “effective” had been left out, you could possibly interpret that as meaning that it is at least an agreement as between the parties by the purchaser to pay what is tendered to the Commission vis-a-vis the parties without bringing in the Commission's authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.639" offset="9509909">Now, if I may, as I was saying, United is keenly aware of the lack of resemblance of this provision to an agreement on a rate change procedure and it is keenly aware of the provision of the -- the rule of contract and construction that says a contract is to be interpreted most strongly against the party drafting it which as I said was in this case United.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.944" offset="9627146">It therefore tries to raise the provision to the stature of the term of art in the industry which it says was accepted as evidencing an agreement on a rate change procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.761" offset="9694438">There's simply nothing to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.905" offset="9703006">This is an act of rationalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.791" offset="9714500">Prior to Mobile and our motions to reject, it was not thought, it was never suggested that the power to change rates was derived from the contracts or any provision of contract between the pipeline company and their customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.333" offset="9780746">In fact, the argument in Mobile was that power was derived from the Act and that it existed regardless of what there was in contract against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.592" offset="9825782">The Act was considered to be the source of the authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.047" offset="9839574">The contract argument was a development of Mobile and of our motions to reject and was advanced to meet those developments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.624" offset="9873847">And we submit, that United has turned to the contracts for escape for Mobile and this little effective superseding rate schedules provisions has been selected as the candidate most likely to succeed as the provision in their opinion more susceptible to interpretation of the view they tried to put upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.470" offset="9961200">The provision is of course no term of argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.605" offset="9973844">If it were, we would expect to find it in each of the contracts in the industry in precisely those terms, but the Commission itself concedes, and I believe the concession appears at pages 111 of its brief, that the contract language varies as between one Natural Gas Company and its customers and another Natural Gas Company and its customers and we have printed as Appendix A to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.180" offset="10092126">The provisions from the formal contract that Texas Gas Transmission Corporation uses which is one of the pipeline petitioners in this case, and that appendix discloses immediately that they employ an -- an entirely different set of words for what I might call their effective superseding rate schedules provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.808" offset="10190555">And additionally, it discloses that they did include an express reservation to change rates under certain specified conditions and the specified conditions were when certain increases incur when increases incurred in certain specified taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.395" offset="10296926">Unless these contracts are held to mean what they say, the publication provision of Section 4 (c) of the Act which says that the contracts need to be published, so that they're available to the public and people may know what's in them, we submit would be frustrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.234" offset="10380309">In interpreting this contract and considering it, we cannot lose sight of a fact that it wasn't drafted by an amateur.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.773" offset="10414477">It was drafted by United which Mr. Carson yesterday described as one of the largest pipeline companies in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.468" offset="10445197">We think perhaps it is the largest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.902" offset="10455019">It has all sorts of resources at its command, including rate experts and the most skillful of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.561" offset="10489605">The drafting of rate contracts for United, of rate schedules, of tariffs is a day in and day out occurrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.931" offset="10519071">And when United sets out to draft the provision reserving the right to file a change in rates United knows how to do it and we don't have to infer that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.345" offset="10572779">We have the contemporaneous evidence in this record as to the meaning and intent of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.006" offset="10599424">The only contemporaneous evidence I might say which shows that United never regarded the effect of superseding rate schedules provision as a reservation of a right to file changes and never intended it to perform that function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.025" offset="10663476">Let me briefly describe that history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.146" offset="10679986">As Mr. Carlson told you yesterday, United had brought the Commission for about four years in and out of the courts challenging the validity of the regulations, which incidentally it now embraces and the most wonderful thing that ever came down to pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.956" offset="10751248">United finally, in 1952, decided that it would comply with the Commission's regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.116" offset="10787819">So, in accordance with those regulations it prepared a propose tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.876" offset="10810911">Now, the regulations say that in the tariff you're supposed to have the proposed form of contract you will use for the purchase and sale of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.819" offset="10846647">United therefore, drafted a proposed form of contract included it in the tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.377" offset="10872874">The proposed form of contract included the effective superseding rate schedules provision that we have before us today and additionally, as we set out at page 57 of our brief, I think it is, it's at page 57 yes, included a provision expressly reserving the right to file changes in rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.192" offset="11000142">If I may take just a moment to read it, “the rate established by seller,” United said, “are designed to reflect seller's cost of rendering service to provide a fair rate of return to seller.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.504" offset="11057403">In the event of an increase in seller's cost, or of any change which would result in the rate of seller providing less than a fair rate of return, seller shall have the right to revise its rates to reflect such change.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.211" offset="11128247">Such revised rates shall be charge only after they have them filed to the Federal Power Commission and become effective in accordance with its rules and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.450" offset="11169207">Now, unhappily perhaps the United, it included this very same provision in the general terms and conditions of the tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.000" offset="11215391">The Commission's regulations expressly state you may not include that kind of a provision in the general terms and conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.141" offset="11251963">The regulations say, you may include that kind of provision in your form of your contract only.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.182" offset="11280071">The Commission therefore, rejected the propose tariff concluding the form of contract and returned it to United pointing out that they had never accepted a tariff which included the provision but what that they having accepted forms of contracts that included such provisions as authorized by the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.455" offset="11369200">The United was extremely anxious by this time after filing to the Commission for four years to have its tariff accepted as rapidly as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.103" offset="11411832">And United was laboring under the impression that the Commission would require a rephrasing of the provision before it would even approve it for inclusion in its form of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.364" offset="11464808">Rather than incur the additional delay that they thought might develop, they struck the provision not only from the general terms and conditions, but they struck the provision from the form of contract as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.412" offset="11524995">And the form of contract which was approved without this provision became the executed contracts for the purchase and sale of gas that we have before us in this very case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.429" offset="11573060">And now, faced by Mobile, faced by our motions to reject, United seeks to read in that -- into that effect a superseding provision a wholly different provision which of its own volition it had deleted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.009" offset="11639411">Even if United were able to hurdle this contemporaneous evidence of their intent, there is yet another hurdle before that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.270" offset="11688417">I'd -- I'd like to refer the Court for a moment to this little pamphlet which is the appendix to United's brief at page 16A.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.778" offset="11774516">I'm particularly, interested in the middle portion of the middle proviso, which says and I'm going to skip a few words that refer to another section that are not material here, “a Natural Gas Company may state in the service agreement that it is or will be its privileges under certain specified conditions to propose to the Commission a modification, change or substitution of the then effective rate or charge.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.460" offset="11901262">And incidentally, may I interpolate here for a moment to say the reference to certain specified conditions has reference to various components of costs involved in serving -- in selling gas that may go up and down if the case maybe, taxes, cost the gas purchase and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.741" offset="11978376">Now, United was on notice as to what it had to do to reserve its right to file rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.806" offset="12014634">And the provision that it voluntarily deleted was in response to this permission that the Commission was giving them in the rules and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.084" offset="12063744">Now, the effective superseding rate schedule provision doesn't even begin to come close to meeting the requirements of this regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.554" offset="12105540">It does not even remotely specify any terms or conditions under which it would be United's right to file changes in rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.820" offset="12150680">And if it were to be interpreted as United now contends, it would be unlawful under these regulations as the Commission's recent decision in the Houston case which we cite and discuss at page 62 of our brief, makes very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.581" offset="12229674">In that case, there was a new pipeline company that had been certificated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.340" offset="12248691">Houston, Texas Gas and Oil will take gas down to Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.777" offset="12270529">In accordance with its right and under the Commission's regulations, it undertook to prepare its tariff and there again, it included a proposed form of agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.582" offset="12313684">The Commissioner rejected it and let me read just quickly the language used by the Commission in rejecting it and I quote, this is at page 62 of our brief, “In the form of service agreement, no changes for the filing of changes are set forth while Section 154.38 (d) (3),” I interpolate the section we were just looking at, “of the Commission's regulation, requires that the service agreements set forth, the specified conditions under which a change my be filed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.230" offset="12456312">Accordingly, the Commission said, “The present language of the form of service agreement is not allowable and revised tariff sheet should be filed enumerating the conditions, if any, under which rate changes may be proposed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.676" offset="12522036">This provision would have to be rejected for the very same purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.534" offset="12537501">And to interpret it as they would contend, just flies in the face of that provision and the contemporaneous evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.804" offset="12574595">If there is any lingering doubt that the effective superseding rate schedules provision was not intended to perform the function that the petitioner is now claim for it, we submit that doubt is dispelled when the unconscionable results that are produced by petitioner's interpretation are considered when applied to sales, for resale, for industrial use only, which have heretofore been referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.128" offset="12699878">Such sales are particularly important to Mississippi as they are to many other distributors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.704" offset="12742196">For example, as we indicate in our brief, and United does not deny this, Willmut Oil and Gas, another contract customer of United, purchases gas under United's rate schedule, which it has provided the sales, for resale, for industrial use only, 45% of its volume of sales is that type of a sale for industrial use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.995" offset="12855359">And the United only answer is, “Well, it's only to one customer.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.852" offset="12874794">Whether it's to one customer or 10 customers, however, 45% is an important part of that utility's sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.374" offset="12912828">In the case of the distributors of gas in the Pacific Northwest, as the amicus brief of the Attorney General of the State of Washington makes claim, 68% of the sales made by the distributors in that case, for industrial use are purchased under contracts of this non-suspendable, non--refundable type.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.985" offset="13019303">And Mississippi, for the period involved in this case, its purchases of gas from United or sales, for resale, for industrial use only, represent the 65%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.444" offset="13085132">And let me pause here to say that in the answering briefs, we have been vigorously challenged as to the accuracy of our 65% and I might say to the Court that that 65% was computed for me at my request by responsible official of Mississippi Valley Gas Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.935" offset="13171127">And it's obvious to me, although, I can't for the light of me analyze all of the figures that have been thrown at me in those answering briefs and where they come from.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.711" offset="13214177">It is clear that they are talking about some percentage in another period not involved in this case when they say the percentage is only 20%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.225" offset="13268302">Well, let me make this point, whether 20% or 65%, the point is that it is significant either at 20% or at 65%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.674" offset="13326085">Let me, for a moment, before I get too deeply into an explanation of the significance of these sales, repeat in part what Mr. Morrow has pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.986" offset="13387316">Except for sales, for resale, for industrial use only, the Commission has the power to suspend new rates, and if the proceeding is not concluded at the end of five months, they become effective subject to refund on motion of the Natural Gas Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.154" offset="13479999">When the Commission concludes its proceedings, they can make it retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.919" offset="13503091">But with respect to sales, for resale, for industrial use only, the Commission has no power of suspension and it has held that it is completely without power of refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.494" offset="13557321">Those new rates are non-suspendable, non-refundable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.118" offset="13579891">They come -- they become effective 30 days after filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.235" offset="13604342">Now, let's see the consequence of that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3426.256" offset="13808410">Now, but the significance of it is -- is that they are contending, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, that a purchaser of its own volition agreed to enter into a contract that granted to its supplier the power to impose, to exact, and to retain at will whatever United, under petitioner's interpretation of their contracts chose to file.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.886" offset="13926902">Now, let me bring it right back to the case at hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.369" offset="13944874">The increase filed for that class of sale was about $650,000 in round number out of the total increase to Mississippi Valley of about, let us say, $900,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.204" offset="14000149">Now, under petitioner's interpretation, that filing maybe made, it goes into effect 30 days after it's filed because the Commission is without power to suspend it, and they can charge it and collect it for as long as that proceeding is pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.588" offset="14073710">And when that proceeding is over and the Commission says, “United, you had no right to charge that rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.136" offset="14107878">It was excessive all through that period and you're not to make that charge to the future.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.986" offset="14131284">And Mississippi then says, “United, how about giving me my money back” and United says, “Sorry, we pocket that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.921" offset="14159078">The Commission has held it has no power of refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.929" offset="14171094">Now, we submit that no responsible officer of Mississippi, the board of directors of Mississippi, no responsible officer of any distribution company would enter into a contract for the purchase of gas, which is essential to its economic wellbeing, which is essential to its ability to sell gas to domestic customers at rates within their reach, to grant to their supplier the power at will in their unfettered discretion to file any rate they choose and to collect it from the date 30 days after filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.410" offset="14344965">And even this prospective relief is illusory because, again, in its unfettered discretion, as soon as the Commission has issued its order saying that the rates of the past were unreasonable and they should be reduced for the future, United can again come forward with a new rate increase for this class of service and it becomes effective within 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.557" offset="14445589">In this very case, during the pendency of these proceedings, United has filed three additional rate increases unilaterally for this type of service and United has been collecting it under its interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.881" offset="14522911">Now, we submit that it's just simply inconceivable and unreasonable to interpret the provision as an agreement by Mississippi to confer such a power on its supplier.</text>

            <text syncTime="3980.117" offset="16023803">To that extent, there is no provision in the Act as the Commission construes it for a refund of those rates that are not properly although initiated they are -- they are found later to be unlawful.</text>

            <text syncTime="4412.474" offset="17753318">And before I go too far from the Chief Justice's question, let me by way of supplement to what the Solicitor General has said with all of which we agree, say that as shown in our reply brief, only 1.8% of all United Gas Pipeline's jurisdictional sales go or sale or resale for industrial use only.</text>
            <text syncTime="4438.096" offset="17855718">Now that is another term of argument, if the Court please, because it's the language of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4444.285" offset="17880482">Direct industrial sales are not subject to regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4447.908" offset="17895006">Sales or resale only are subject to regulation and the Non-suspendability Clause applies in Section 4 -- in Section 4 to sale or resale for industrial use only what is usually called in the tariffs an I-rate meaning industrial rate or interruptible rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4471.515" offset="17989465">They aren't guaranteed of both amendments and for that to get a lower price and they buy in large volume and their large-volume usage usually what they call a volumetric rate not always, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="4485.694" offset="18046098">But – now the trick in the statistics is this as our reply brief shows that many of these distributors buy it from us and other pipelines on a g-rate, a full commodity and demand schedule with a specified regular billing demand and supply and in off-peak periods they divert some of that consumer gas to industrial use.</text>
            <text syncTime="4517.610" offset="18173785">Now, that's not the sale by us or resale for industrial use only therefore, it's not a non-suspendable sale, it's a suspendable sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="4527.347" offset="18212760">So, counsel can tell you “Oh, we resell, it's a great percentage of our gas for industrial use.”</text>

            <text syncTime="4978.010" offset="20015417">I respectfully suggest that is a misstatement of what the Commission held as just quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="4984.244" offset="20040391">Then the Court goes on, “Correct though the Commission's statement that the parties intent maybe, it does not answer the question and go on, it goes on to the point of law which it was deemed erroneously.</text>

            <text syncTime="5014.061" offset="20159613">Now, it seemed to me that when Mr. Goldberg told Justice Frankfurter that the effective superseding orders did not detract from the validity of the contract and the contract as restated by him without those would have permitted to find he had considered a way this case and I think necessarily so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5034.055" offset="20239548">I leave to our brief the fact pages 17 to 18 of our brief every word effective, superseding on file comes from the statute or the regulations which are binding on us.</text>

            <text syncTime="5055.394" offset="20324916">But in any event, those words are terms of art and they take with them a great deal of history and Your Honors look back to the beginning of the filings -- the beginning of this book, you will see in the early rate schedules, stamped at the top the word “superseded.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5070.791" offset="20386565">One of the words in the regulations showing this has been taken away and the new schedule has taken its place which the Mississippi Valley among others has agreed to pay according to the new rate.</text>
