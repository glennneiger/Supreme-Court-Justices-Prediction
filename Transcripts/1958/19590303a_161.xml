            <label>Ms. Bessie Margolin</label>
            <text syncTime="39.570" offset="158198">Mr. Chief Justice and Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.188" offset="180663">The specific question presented by this case is whether the retail or service establishment exemption from both the minimum wage and the overtime requirement for the Fair Labor Standards Act applies to the business of lending money on credit and purchasing conditional sales contracts, and taking life insurance to insure the borrowers, specifically the business of making small loans and discounting condition of sales contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.856" offset="331337">The broader and underlying issue that's inherent in this specific issue here is whether the 1949 amendment to the original Fair Labor Standards Act, which was enacted in 1938, whether the 1949 amendment so broadened the scope of the so-called retail or service establishment exemption as to make every and any business within the general coverage of the Act eligible to claim this exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.827" offset="471249">The exemption and question is quoted on page 2 of the Government's brief in Section 13 (a) (10), and it provides that Section VI and VII, which are the minimum wage and overtime requirements of the Act, shall not apply with respect to any employee employed by any retail or service establishment under certain conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.263" offset="580963">One, being more than 50% of its annual dollar volume of sales is -- of services is made within the State in which the establishment is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.118" offset="624431">And the second condition being that 75% of annual dollar volume of sales or services is not to resale and is recognized as retail sales or services in the particular industry.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="168.479" offset="673855">Is there any issue on the 50% borrowed here, Ms. Margolin?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bessie_margolin" startTime="174.077" stopTime="675.827">
            <label>Ms. Bessie Margolin</label>
            <text syncTime="174.077" offset="696216">Well, there's no issue if we get to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.323" offset="705202">The Government's basic position is that this exemption has no application whatsoever to the business of lending money to credit companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.834" offset="751282">And therefore, that there is no occasion or need to determine whether or not 50 -- whether the percentage requirements are met so that -- although, the court below found that they did meet -- the Court of Appeals found that they did meet both of those conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.694" offset="830694">The Government's basic position is that there's no occasion to go into those conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.919" offset="863608">The Court of Appeals -- the business here, respondent's business is located in Louisville, Kentucky and they make loans both in Kentucky and Indiana which was stipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.884" offset="935497">There's no question of their engagement in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.438" offset="953678">It was a pretrial stipulation that they were engaged in interstate commerce and then they are in the production of goods for interstate commerce, their employees, sufficiently to be with the subject to this Act unless they came within this exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.224" offset="1024836">So that the entire evidence was directed to the exemption point.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.961" offset="1051794">The rather voluminous records is explained by respondent's endeavor to prove that their lending of money and the purchasing of this discount favor thus constitute sales of services within the liberal language of the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.157" offset="1140611">The Court of Appeals accepted respondent's construction of this Act, of this provision stating that the literal terms of -- that the statutory language was so clear and unambiguous and so plainly applied to any business that was engaged in the broadest sense of the term “engaged in sales of goods or in performing services,” that it was unnecessary to look to the legislative history to tell -- to determine what Congress meant by this attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.602" offset="1318348">The Government's position is that this exemption does not encompass every conceivable business that might be said to be engaged in service.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.244" offset="1368921">That it is limited to the particular kinds of businesses that are traditionally regarded as retail, and the services of a light character, except that the establishment of sales, services, instead of goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.643" offset="1462544">This was definitely the interpretation of the original exemption which was enacted at the time of 1938 that the courts have upheld the law restricted interpretation, but it didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.266" offset="1528999">This exemption was not intended to encompass everything that could, in the economic sense and the broadest sense constitute a service.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.270" offset="1572989">And it is -- it is clear that before the 1949 amendment, this exemption was given that limited construction both by the Administrator and by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.041" offset="1624085">The exemption at that time, read, simply, that any employee engaged in any retail or service establishment, the greater part of who's selling their services -- servicing is in intrastate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.119" offset="1692421">In other words, there was no spelling out except in the general terms of the 50% rule, but there was no spelling out of the 75% with respect to retail sales or sales not recognized or recognized as retail in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.294" offset="1781133">Congress in enacting the 1949 amendment or -- as -- did as counsel -- as opposing counsel point out was dissatisfied with some of the Administrator's interpretations of this exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.039" offset="1884056">What counsel does not recognize, however, is that the legislative history makes it perfectly clear that Congress was dissatisfied with only a very limited aspect of those interpretations and the legislative history makes it so clear that Congress had no -- we had felt no dissatisfaction at all with the basic interpretation of the former exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.751" offset="2002965">That is, that it was limited to certain types of establishments and did not extend to categories in the financial field and the utility field and the real estate or in the insurance field.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.903" offset="2055523">Legislative history makes that so clear, that we submit, that it is controlling and conclusive, and clearly shows the error of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.820" offset="2103275">Prior to the decision of the Court of Appeals in the instant case, every court which considered this issue, and that includes the First Circuit Court of Appeals, in the Aetna Finance case and all three District Courts in the Household Finance and Aetna Finance and in the instant case, every court which had considered this issue and examined the legislative history concluded that the legislative history was conclusive on this and as did dissenting judge in the instant case, Judge Miller dissented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.581" offset="2278296">For that reason, in the limited time available, I would like to emphasize the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.547" offset="2314136">As I stated earlier, there was no question that the administrative interpretation prior to the 1949 amendment, was that this exemption had no application to banks, insurance companies, credit companies including personal finance companies, newspapers, telephone companies and the like that those -- those areas of industry according to the Administrator and the judicial interpretations might save because the personal finance company issue had not arisen, specifically of that issue, but the courts have pretty -- pretty generally upheld the basic classifications of the Administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.984" offset="2515905">When the proposal -- proposed amendment came before Congress, the sponsors explicitly asserted the legislative intent to do nothing to change, and I'm quoting, “to do nothing to change the previous non-exempt status of establishments” such as, and I'm quoting, “banks, insurance companies, credit companies, newspapers, telephone companies, gas and electric utility companies, telegraph companies, et cetera”.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.012" offset="2663967">Now, this statement was made in the reports of both the House and the Senate as quoted on pages 25 and 26 of the Government's brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="790.799" offset="3163115">Well, I'll say what this Court said in the Phillips case was that the reference was to establishments selling merchandise epitomized by the corner grocery, the drug store and the department store.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.106" offset="3216405">And in the -- the Roland Electric, recognized the Administrator's interpretation that service establishments was a comparable type.</text>

            <text syncTime="995.418" offset="3981584">That is the -- that's -- that's the respondent's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.199" offset="3996735">That enlarging the qualifications for exemption, Congress opened up the whole exemption and just granted a field day and open season to every -- every and every -- every employer that could possibly be subject to the Act to come in and -- and prove and put the Government to -- to rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.536" offset="4082103">As this record indicates, this is a pretty complicated and complex and kind of a -- a battle of the experts that's involved in -- in trying to determine whether a particular transaction is recognized as retail in -- in a particular industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.842" offset="4151275">We say that -- that the whole purpose of the voluminous legislative history and the whole purpose was to disavow any such intent to -- to open this exemption up to everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.056" offset="4204147">And the -- that the very reason why the legislative history is so voluminous is that the sponsors were required to answer the -- felt required to answer the charges and the criticism, that this would open -- this was going to expand this exemption far beyond anything that -- and -- that the -- the Congress would be willing to pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.050" offset="4292127">Now, in this connection, I'd like to refer to -- to opposing counsel's reference to twice -- two or three times, he mentioned that the Administrator himself said that these amendments were -- was substituting a wholly, completely new definitions of the retail establishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.219" offset="4368823">What counsel failed to note is that the -- that the Administrator's criticism was one of the very reasons why the lengthy debates were held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.155" offset="4404558">That the -- the debates took up the Administrator's charges and the sponsors disavowed repeatedly that there was any intent to expand this -- this exemption to any such extent, and specifically stated that they were adopting the Administrator's basic categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.266" offset="4488986">Every reference that they made to the basic categories to be within this exemption was a paraphrase of the Administrator's basic category that the Court will compare it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.725" offset="4538828">We have gotten up because the counsel quotes some excerpts from the legislative history too, some general excerpts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.467" offset="4577802">We have prepared and it was submitted to the First Circuit in the Aetna case and to the Sixth Circuit below here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.704" offset="4610717">The substance of the legislative history and its -- we have filed copies of it in this Court which brings together in one booklet, all of -- virtually all of the legislative history that bears on this particular point.</text>

            <text syncTime="1180.034" offset="4720118">Yes, the Administrator, in addition to making this distinction in basic category, said that some establishments, many in fact, frequently, establishments which one would regard as retail establishments also make wholesales or nonretail sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.348" offset="4797336">For example a coal -- coal dealer will sell in small amounts, and he'll also sell in coal, load lots to hotels and apartments and industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.840" offset="4843311">And the question was whether a retail -- whether an establishment that might look retail also engaged in a lot of this wholesale, this wholesale, a quantity of sales, sale for business use, whether that would defeat the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.947" offset="4911752">The Administrator, taking cognizance of the fact that frequently, an establishment did both -- made both kinds of sale, adopted this 25% tolerance test which is the forerunner of the 75% provision in the amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.552" offset="4982178">He said that if a -- an establishment made such wholesale or nonretail sales, and it didn't exceed 25% of its total annual dollar volume of business, it would not defeat the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.541" offset="5050096">And in connection with applying that test to the categories that he held were eligible, he said that he would treat it as a retail sale, a nonretail sales, sales for industrial use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.208" offset="5112790">This is where the so-called consumer use, “business use” test came in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.502" offset="5134002">Now, the Supreme Court adopted that view that a retail sale is something ordinarily for consumer use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.698" offset="5166707">And in the Roland Electric case, the Supreme Court approved that and stated it in general terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.940" offset="5191680">Now, that was what Congress was dissatisfied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.379" offset="5205473">They felt that there should be more leeway for your dealers, your coal dealers, and your paint dealers and your other shops to be able to engage in more sales for non-consumer use without losing the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.681" offset="5278720">Undoubtedly, the sponsors felt that that type of establishment, even if it -- if it sold -- what -- for business use, was still of the traditional type of retail establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.908" offset="5343608">And therefore, they put in this provision that if they would -- instead of -- of having the consumer use, “business use” test determine, it should be what was recognized in the particular industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.943" offset="5403690">Now, that was what they hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.677" offset="5410691">If you can't read this legislative history without seeing that that was the thing, they were primary -- primarily concerned with, if not solely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.549" offset="5442142">And the sponsors themselves repeatedly said that was the only substantial difference between their proposed amendment and what the Administrator had been doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.008" offset="5488013">That was the only substantial difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.185" offset="5496686">And as I say, they repeatedly, explicitly said that credit companies, banks, public utilities, telephone companies were not to be -- were to remain non-exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.690" offset="5542661">They recognized they were non-exempt and so they were to remain that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.854" offset="5559380">And of -- of -- what I want to point out is that the approach of respondents, the construction respondent's take of this amendment, and of the court below, means not only that credit companies or small loan companies, personal loan companies, not only that those would be eligible for this exemption, but they frankly concede that their reasoning, the manner in which they construed this exemption means that banks, insurance companies, newspapers, telephone companies, utility companies, telegraph companies, transportation companies, all of those can come in and if they can show that the 75% of their services to -- is to consumers or individual use, or that -- even if it isn't, if it's recognized in that particular industry, if they call it retail, they can show that they're entitled to this exemption.</text>

            <text syncTime="1750.956" offset="7003742">The Beetle amendment had been virtually killed by the administrative interpretations of the amended Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.237" offset="7032895">When they got around to talking about this retail exemption, the Administrator, appealing his oath, so to speak, had the Lesinski Bill introduced, which was designed to approve of all of the administrative interpretations.</text>

            <text syncTime="3176.579" offset="12706273">That is what the employees do that counts and not what the employer does, then I think the question is, are these employees engaged in a local activity or aren't they?</text>

            <text syncTime="3194.915" offset="12779624">And I -- I assert that the Congress, in adapting this amendment, definitely indicated that it was going to leave it to the industries, that is not leave it to the industries, but permit the industries to say what is their custom and practice and then have the courts or the Administrator, and the Administrator determine what is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.617" offset="12874397">Now, the fear that this would open the -- the door to a tremendous number of -- of cases is not -- has not been realized.</text>

            <text syncTime="3247.827" offset="12991216">I want to call attention to -- to this aspect, the one referred to by the Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.583" offset="13022250">One of the objections to the amendment in Congress was that it would leave it to the industry, and that therefore, it wasn't a good idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.456" offset="13061747">This industry recognition test was therefore called a joker.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.117" offset="13076376">But the answer given by the sponsors was and I quote, “Under the amendment, the courts would decide the question of what sales or services are recognized as retail in a particular industry.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.793" offset="13123082">Now, that decision has been made by three -- every court that's heard it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.828" offset="13139278">Each of the three lower courts have agreed that this business is recognized as retail in the financial industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.445" offset="13173760">They have the qualifications where we lost, based on the claim that you cannot apply the retail exemption to personal loan company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.071" offset="13220258">Now, Senator Holland said, “How better could the matter be left than by recognizing the dividing line between retail sales and wholesale sales in a particular industry of the thousands of industries which will be affected by the law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.967" offset="13283788">And Senator Taft said, hardly, and this is the answer given in the House of Congress, “Hardly, an industry can be found in which the question of what is retail and what is wholesale had not been settled for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.515" offset="13341989">It is a question of fact, just as much as any other question of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.063" offset="13360170">It is a question of fact which we are perfectly able to determine.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.085" offset="13380336">Now, with those pronouncements, I don't see how it can be said that an establishment, which is recognized as retail, as a retail service establishment in an industry, can't qualify unless it meets some preconceived idea of what is a retail service establishment, whether that preconceived idea comes from the Administrator or anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.782" offset="13491096">And I might say this to, Your Honors'.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.134" offset="13496529">I know that you have held and we are reminded that the -- great weight must be given to the Administrator, but the Administrator in -- for a long time has served as an advocate to expand this very good Act and to limit exemptions under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.673" offset="13570612">And when he's defeated in Congress, he turns to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.351" offset="13585345">In fact Judge Magruder had occasion to -- to comment on that in connection with the (Inaudible) amendment where he said that the administrator would have us decide this -- this case as though the amendment had not been adapted, and that's what the Administrator is trying to do in this case.</text>
