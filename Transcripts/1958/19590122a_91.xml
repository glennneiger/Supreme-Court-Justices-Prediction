            <text syncTime="71.897" offset="390980">The record below is very short, 20 pages long, consists of the petition for habeas corpus and a three-line order in which the Supreme Court of Florida denied the petition without opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.933" offset="455137">The petitioner is a young man of 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.729" offset="474258">He is an inmate of the Florida State Penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.748" offset="490350">He is serving a 15-year term out of a possible maximum 20 for burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.950" offset="523160">He contends that his imprisonment is unlawful because his trial took place over his objection without the benefit of the presence of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.594" offset="565791">That was some four years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.632" offset="577912">He did not appeal, instead some three years later, about a year ago, he brought the instant proceeding originally in the Supreme Court of Florida which has original jurisdiction in these matters and then here.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.113" offset="647816">He had no counsel at any stage until after the grant of certiorari here, when I was appointed to represent him.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.199" offset="692120">His petition alleges that at the time of his trial, he was only 20 years old that he was an uneducated farm boy and that he had never so much has been inside a criminal trial court for him to trial except some 10 weeks before when he had listened to his own previous trial on the same charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.891" offset="830986">Then he had been represented by experienced and paid criminal counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="197.550" offset="893576">He was then sent to solitary confinement where he remained for the 10 weeks intervening between that trial and the present trial of which he is now complaining.</text>

            <text syncTime="243.786" offset="1078523">After he'd been there for a period which isn't entirely certain, either a week before the trial or four days before the trial, there are conflicting allegations in his petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.269" offset="1144456">He received notice that his first counsel had withdrawn from the case or was going to withdraw from the case either one.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.285" offset="1172564">He could do nothing about it, of course, but his mother knew about it and she then immediately set about trying to get him some counsel.The petition recites that she saw, "a number," unspecified of lawyers, but that they all refused to take the case because the amount of money she could offer as a fee, the amount is unspecified, was insufficient and because the time for preparation was insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.553" offset="1345599">That time was either four days or a week, we don't know.On trial day, or retrial day, the petitioner explain these facts to the trial judge and asked for a continuance to find, go out and hire a counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="380.049" offset="1623542">He did notify the court that he intended to withdraw.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.800" offset="1650604">I think you can detect from the record as I develop the facts later, a very good reason why he should withdraw, although I have not consulted with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.716" offset="1690206">He happens to be in Asia at that time and I -- I don't know precisely why he withdrew, but he did withdraw a week or five or four days before the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.737" offset="1734301">The petitioner reported to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.403" offset="1749034">His efforts to obtain or his mother's efforts to obtain counsel in this very short period, asked for a continuance, the court said no.</text>

            <text syncTime="428.064" offset="1815594">Then he asked for appointment of counsel, three counsels refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.963" offset="1843179">The reason doesn't appear, but of -- of course, we -- we know what it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.161" offset="1860002">It's perfectly standard in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.591" offset="1877765">No, I won't say it's perfectly standard in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.766" offset="1886438">Florida does authorize as this Court had seen a number of cases, Wade against Mayo is the leading one, that there'll be paid counsel, free only in a capital case and this isn't a capital case, 20-year maximum sentence to which the boy got 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.643" offset="1965955">The trial then proceeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.920" offset="1975045">The petitioner defendant himself, the pattern of the trial was primarily that of an accomplice case.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.136" offset="2015901">A fellow named, Allen, Lawrence Allen, who was a codefendant with him, pleaded guilty, turned State's evidence and testified against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.655" offset="2061981">And there was corroboration in the form of evidence, that loot from the burglary had turned up in Allen's possession, so that it was clear from the corroboration that Allen had -- had a part in the crime, but in this, I stress, there was nothing in the evidence except the uncorroborated word of Allen that the petitioner had, along with Allen, taken part in the trial, taken in -- in the crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="731.660" offset="3029974">It seems to me that at this stage of the case they petitioned, where the petitioner hasn't had an opportunity to go into the facts and demonstrate what happened here that where the attorneys, themselves, are reported as saying that they don't think that this period of a week or four days, whichever it is, is enough, but that's conclusive, that's binding.</text>

            <text syncTime="5078.718" offset="20418226">I don't know why he was taken there.</text>

            <text syncTime="5118.400" offset="20576946">They've got enough trouble and I don't say that in terms of whether he was a dangerous person, but they had another mouth to feed and another cell to clean and they were probably reluctant to take it.</text>

            <text syncTime="5164.421" offset="20761057">But they do in some portions of the State of Florida enjoy a dangerous or infamous reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5169.765" offset="20782477">Now, if I may, he was brought before the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5175.314" offset="20804629">He moved for a continuance in order to secure counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5179.582" offset="20821661">He alleges in his petition that the only reason the trial court denied his motion for a continuance was because the State had gone to great expense to bring witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="5190.161" offset="20863979">We take the position from the record that that could not have been the only reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="5194.878" offset="20882892">The record shows that he had somebody attempting to procure counsel to represent him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5201.857" offset="20910791">That he was held for whatever purposes and must we not assume at this point that they were for a lawful purpose in closed custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="5210.559" offset="20945586">He could not have, under any circumstances, easily conferred with a counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5215.699" offset="20966170">There would have been a procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5217.084" offset="20971708">They would -- counsel would have gone to Raiford, and which I understand can -- of course, can be done, but there was no telephone that he could reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="5223.349" offset="20996786">He would have to be taken to the warden's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="5225.365" offset="21004831">So the only person who could logically talk to counsel attempt to procure counsel on his behalf was his mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="5234.405" offset="21040985">Now, the record shows, not very clear, but it does establish that during the week preceding the second trial, both Mr. Cash and his mother were aware of counsel's withdrawal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5246.951" offset="21091140">Now, we admit that he could not go out and solicit counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5253.052" offset="21115591">He may have been permitted, if he had asked, and we have no allegation that he did ask to use the telephone in the warden's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="5259.669" offset="21142026">From my personal experience, I know that has been done, but he would not have been permitted unconfident to make repeated trips to the warden's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="5269.668" offset="21182046">So the only person that's able -- the only person who he would -- imagine would want to or could, would be his mother and his mother made the -- these efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5278.850" offset="21218722">And nowhere in the petition do we have any allegation that shows that she had procured counsel, that she thought she had counsel except her statement to Mr. Duncan, the prosecutor, during the week preceding that -- that she had gotten counsel that day, but evidently did not because no counsel appeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="5295.929" offset="21287058">And so, we submit that the trial court had no cause to delay any further.</text>
            <text syncTime="5301.250" offset="21308374">We had no indication of how long they wanted.</text>
