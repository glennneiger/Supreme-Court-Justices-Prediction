          <turn speaker="leonard_r_hartenfeld" startTime="0.000" stopTime="486.695">
            <label>Mr. Leonard R. Hartenfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">--the election of remedies issue and it isn't as simple as the Government's argument seems to -- might indicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.893" offset="174895">First of all, if this Court is to -- does sustain our position on the lease, obviously, the election of remedies issue is no longer pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.646" offset="225991">On the other hand, if this Court does not agree with our position on the lease then the election of remedy issue becomes of great importance to the condemnee.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.082" offset="267682">Now, the facts in every case are important and it is pretty difficult to discuss general principles of law without saying, “What are the facts in the particular case?”</text>
            <text syncTime="52.115" offset="311881">And therefore, on this argument of election of remedies, I would appreciate if this Court would start with the simple fundamental proposition that we are not in the position of squatters.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.009" offset="359424">I don't know what the law is with reference to squatters but I do know that we held possession for seven and one-half years under color of a formal naval lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.374" offset="408848">We operated the property and maintained that on behalf of the Navy and we did everything in compliance faithfully with that lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.245" offset="448345">We think it's most unconscionable on the part of the Government to now seek to take advantage of the situation by taking two inconsistent positions, number one, that you don't have a title to this -- to the lease, under the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.923" offset="519084">Or number two, we're going to grab it anyhow regardless.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.393" offset="532982">And I would like to show later in this argument how this works and will work a tremendous hardship upon all condemnees situated such as this lessee was situated if the Government's theory of this case on election of remedies is followed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.720" offset="614275">Prior to the case at bar, there are only four cases in the whole history of United States in which the right of the Government to contest title of the condemnee was an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.997" offset="671326">In all the other cases cited by the Government except the U.S. versus Turner and U.S. versus San Geronimo, in all the other cases, the issue of election of remedies was never made a part of the case so they weren't discussed in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.599" offset="737782">Now, it is important to understand that a determination in our favor in this case will not in any way affect the governmental procedures that have been going out for years about title contest as between claimants to different funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.485" offset="809357">And the Court of Appeals makes this distinction very clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.869" offset="822836">In fact because of the paucity of election on remedy cases such us ours where there was a title contest in the condemnation proceeding and the point was actually argued and decided since there are only four of those cases in the whole history of the country, the occasion can't arise very often and the possibilities of it arising hereafter again is very remote.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.200" offset="920221">Therefore, when the Government argues expediency, justifies the result in this case, it is a fallacious argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.234" offset="952299">Now, the Government relies U.S. versus Turner and U.S. versus San Geronimo Development Company, both of which held that the condemnee's title can be contested in a condemnation proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.204" offset="1000155">In other words, these two cases do support the Government's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.768" offset="1018441">The Turner case was decided in 1949 by the Fifth Circuit and the First Circuit decided the San Geronimo case in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.957" offset="1055222">On the other hand, interestingly enough, there are exactly two cases supporting our position and the Court of Appeals below.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.494" offset="1089390">One was U.S. versus Chicago B &amp; Q. Railroad decided by the Seventh Circuit back in very early days and U.S. versus 1148 of Acres decided by the Fifth Circuit in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.910" offset="1155009">U.S. versus 11 Acres is an election of remedies case saying that you cannot contest title in a condemnation proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.085" offset="1195760">You cannot test the title of the condemnee in a condemnation proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.501" offset="1213419">It directly overrules the holding in U.S. versus Turner which is relied upon by the Government and which was decided it by the same Fifth Circuit, seven or so years before.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.159" offset="1260022">Now, it overrules the Turner case, it doesn't refer to the Turner case.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.440" offset="1277158">But the net result is that it overrules that there's any doubt about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.891" offset="1294921">And the Turner case and -- and -- pardon me.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.220" offset="1308296">In the U.S. versus 11 Acres as cited by the Court of Appeals as one of the federal cases, the Court of Appeals below, as one of the federal cases establishing a federal law of this country to be, that you cannot contest title in a condemnation proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.407" offset="1388962">Now, the net result is that the Government in this case has only the old San Geronimo case to rely upon as far as what the Court of Appeals below has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.171" offset="1432012">The San Geronimo case, the Court in that case and there's no evidence if the parties really brought up the election of remedies point, in that decision, from reading it as, that may very well have been that the judge just passingly said that this is a hybrid proceeding justified only by the peculiar circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.303" offset="1516544">So that even the First Circuit which is relied upon by the Government on San Geronimo case, admits that it applies only with our peculiar circumstances justifying the Government to try a title in a case -- try a title of the condemnee in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.719" offset="1590209">On the other hand, there was a dissent in the Turner case, that was a split decision, which I would like to read if I may out of page five of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.229" offset="1648306">Now, the Turner case was subsequently, as I mentioned before, overruled by U.S. versus 11 Acres but the dissent in the Turner case at page five stated the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.187" offset="1716120">“The Government initially set out towards the goal of acquiring title to the lands by a condemnation suit but now has reversed the field and is trying to run with the ball in the opposite direction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="417.109" offset="1771813">It's assertion that it does not now want condemnation but confirmation of a title that it already owns seems to me to be so utterly and violently inconsistent with proceedings and eminent domain as not to be permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.879" offset="1838895">And that is exactly how the Court of Appeals below felt about this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.524" offset="1857494">They were the two Judges, Judge Major and Judge Schnackenberg have had years of experience with condemnation proceedings in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.467" offset="1893230">As soon as the oral arguments started, they immediately jumped on Government counsel saying, “How can you adopt such an inconsistent procedure?”</text>
            <text syncTime="455.596" offset="1925726">It is inconsistent with everything that is brought up in -- in condemnation proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.655" offset="1945997">In fact, the customary jury verdict that every federal court in the land uses on a condemnation case merely has one short sentence, “How much is the condemnee entitled to receive his just compensation?”</text>
            <text syncTime="475.457" offset="2005243">That is the instruction that goes out in every condemnation in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.243" offset="2024364">And that's how simple -- that's a simple basic issue in an orthodox condemnation proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.431" offset="2049128">Well --</text>

            <text syncTime="1670.080" offset="6783666">Now, because we won the lawsuit below, we had to go through this tremendous eight-day condemnation proceeding trial evaluation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.632" offset="6821909">The Court of Appeals in its opinion says that our case was the most complicated valuation question in the history of all the law books.</text>

            <text syncTime="1706.134" offset="6927862">And likewise, the trial court had to spend eight days of its time closing of this case and the trial court doesn't know if it hasn't wasted its time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.746" offset="6966314">That is why we say there's a hardship on the Court and on the litigants also to follow this theory and that is exactly what the Court of Appeals felt, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.175" offset="7004035">The -- if I may have just one sentence more, Your Honor, I hate to overindulge in this but under our theory, the scope of -- of election of remedies would wipe out any claim by the Government as to the statutory power to lease or this -- or the intention of the parties in drafting the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.388" offset="7080939">And we say that because under the Illinois which is effective law and which is effective here, the condemnee concedes the full title of the condemnee -- the condemnor concedes the full title of the condemnee by merely filing the condemnation suit.</text>
