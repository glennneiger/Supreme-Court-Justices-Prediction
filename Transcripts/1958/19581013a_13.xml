            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 13, Federal Housing Administration, Appellant, versus The Darlington Incorporated.Before the argument in this case I make the announcement that the orders of the Court appear upon the list certified by the Chief Justice and filed with the clerk and will not be orally announced.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.884" offset="234872">Now, Mr. Rosenthal, you may proceed in number 13.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="36.864" stopTime="235.215">
            <label>Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal</label>
            <text syncTime="36.864" offset="250859">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.398" offset="260995">This case arises out of the Veterans' Emergency Housing Program, which was established in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.864" offset="298820">In that year, Congress was apprised that a national emergency existed because of a critical housing shortage.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.734" offset="338317">In this connection, it was called specifically to the congressional attention, almost 3 million returning World War II veterans and their families would be in need of residential housing by the end of 1946 and that the majority of them would not have the means to purchase homes, and therefore, would require so-called "rental housing".</text>
            <text syncTime="85.797" offset="446568">In an endeavor to meet this acute problem in the statutory words to accelerate the production of houses with preference for World War II veterans and at sales prices or rentals within their means, Congress amended Section 608 of the National Housing Act to authorize the Federal Housing Administration to ensure mortgages covering multifamily housing projects in which a preference would be given to veterans.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.968" offset="571225">The particularly attractive feature of Section 608 was its provision that the principle obligation of the insured mortgage could be as much as 90% of the reasonable replacement cost of the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.785" offset="638516">This meant that if the project sponsor served as architect and builder of the project, they could construct it with little, if any, outlay of cash and thus, with little, if any, risk of loss, that the other 10% would be represented by architect fees and the builder's profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.991" offset="719287">Now, judged by any objective standard, this program established under Section 608 was an immense success.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.371" offset="756903">Well over 7,000 apartment houses were constructed containing over 450,000 rental units.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.790" offset="798490">These projects were backed by Government insurance in an amount in excess of $3 billion.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.611" offset="829837">With extremely due exceptions, these projects were successful in their operation, as is evidenced by the fact that the rate of default has run only between 1% and 1.5% of the total mortgages outstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.872" offset="890859">At the same time however, in some instances, project owners having applied for and obtained the advantage of Government mortgage insurance which enabled them to build this residential housing at little or no cost to themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.017" offset="955434">Started to engage, endeavored to increase the profitableness of their operations in a practice outside what we deem at any rate to be the scope of the legislative aid, namely the practice of renting units for transient occupancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.201" offset="1028159">One of these instances was that of the appellee in this case.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="235.215" offset="1044250">How general is that right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="237.602" stopTime="529.089">
            <label>Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal</label>
            <text syncTime="237.602" offset="1053759">Your Honor, there are no specific statistics on it, insofar as the record and the congressional reports indicate that it could hardly be described as a widespread practice, but there were instances of it being done.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.344" offset="1116766">I don't think that there is any really -- really available figures on the -- the precise percentage of instances, but I think it is fair to characterize it as a -- as not a widespread practice, as a limited, relatively few of the 7000 plus units that were built.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.409" offset="1193044">Now, the issue in this case is the appellee's right to engage in this practice of transient rentals.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.864" offset="1222823">Now, on December 1949, the appellee was incorporated in the State of South Carolina for the purpose of obtaining Section 608 insurance of a mortgage covering a 12-storey apartment house to be constructed in Charleston.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.726" offset="1282278">Consistent with this purpose, it's charter which was prepared on a standard FHA form, specifically prohibited it from engaging in any business other than a construction and operation of a rental housing project so long as any of its property was subject to FHA insurance -- insured mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.982" offset="1359287">The appellee submitted an application to the FHA for a mortgage commitment on a -- this proposed project.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.581" offset="1393664">This application was disapproved by the local FHA officials, because the chief underwriter was dissatisfied with the location, which the apartment house was to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.715" offset="1458239">At the insistence of the appellee however, the rejection by the local officials was reversed by the FHA officials in Washington and the mortgage commitment was authorized not withstanding the local objection to the location at which the project was to be built.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.332" offset="1528665">Project was completed in July 1951 and in September 1951 as it was required to do under its charter and under the regulations, the appellee submitted and the Federal Housing Administration approved a proposed schedule of maximum monthly rentals.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.293" offset="1604524">And this schedule contained no indication that the appellee intended to furnish any of the partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.932" offset="1639111">One month later however, with the aid of a parent corporation which held all but three of the 1999 shares of common stock in a dollar form, the appellee engaged on a course of conduct concealed from the FHA which in the words of the Court below was a subterfuge.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.706" offset="1726151">First, without seeking FHA approval, the parent corporation furnished a number of appellees apartments and the tenants of those apartments were charged $15 to $20 a month in addition to the scheduled approved rentals.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.427" offset="1801070">This additional rental however was paid to the parent corporation so that it appeared that appellee was maintaining its schedule of rentals.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.582" offset="1841716">Four month later in February of 1952, again, without applying for permission or even advising the FHA that it intended to do so, the appellee started to rent his furnished efficiency apartment on a transient basis at the rate of $6 per day.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.014" offset="1911411">Now, the schedule rental on these apartments was $77.50 per month which broken down to a daily basis would have been less than $2.60.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.672" offset="1950072">In order again to maintain the appearance of complying with its schedule of rentals, the appellee divided the $6 into two parts, it retained the $2.60 approximately and the balance was paid over as a so-called "furniture rental" to the parent corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.556" offset="2033560">Additionally, in April of 1952, the appellee submitted the required rental housing occupancy report to the Federal Housing Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.708" offset="2074206">In that report it failed to disclose that some of the units had been furnished and were being rented on a daily basis, despite the fact that the instruction from the Court indicated that the report should reflect those units if any which were furnished.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.038" offset="2131571">In short, at no time from the inception of the project did the appellee make an extended endeavor to obtain a larger number of residential tenants at the schedule of rentals, nor if I'm able to obtain residential tenants at those rentals, did it make an endeavor to increase the occupancy of the project through lower rentals.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="529.089" offset="2219760">Has anybody turned down who otherwise would have been eligible or have it or -- or if you had a little preference to --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="537.853" stopTime="740.275">
            <label>Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal</label>
            <text syncTime="537.853" offset="2254764">Insofar as the record shows, no, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.653" offset="2261974">But the -- our point here is that the appellee at these rentals, the appellee apparently felt it was unable to build its buildings, it resorted to furnishing apartments rather than to lowering their rentals in an endeavor to acquire tenants that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.770" offset="2330415">And there's no showing in this record that their rents could not have been lowered.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.481" offset="2353298">Now, what it did here was almost immediately after the establishment of the project, it went into the -- first, into the furnish departments of rentals in excess of those approved in the schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.730" offset="2394258">And then when that didn't prove a financial success, it embarked on the practice of running the transients.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.177" offset="2412126">Now, it is to be noted here that the rental only was a part but gain was $77.50 a month, that if potentially, these transient units could have obtained up to $180 a month, considerably in excess of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.840" offset="2474715">And of course, it has to be taken again against the congressional background as we'll see that Congress was endeavoring to provide for the veterans, moderate and low-cost rental housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.787" offset="2522572">Now in 1954, the attention of Congress was directed to the fact that some Section 608 projects, which it received as Government aid to provide residential housing for veterans were being used as the appellee's project for transit purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.700" offset="2586206">It further came to the attention of the Congress that in a due isolated instances, the record indicates that this was between 12 and 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.966" offset="2615254">Where the FHA deemed a hardship to exist, it had granted permission for transient rentals and it had done so in the belief that the power inferred to qualify the statue to regulate the methods of operation, of the mortgagor, gave it discretion in what it deemed be to be a hardship case to -- to permit this, but it was done on these 12 to 15 cases only on a special -- special request.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.745" offset="2726327">Well, this came to the attention of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.145" offset="2735940">Both of the congressional committees concerned agreed that this practice clearly violated the legislative purpose underlying Section 608 and that the integrity of the multifamily housing project program required that the FHA take action to ensure that the practice stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.562" offset="2805635">Now, the House Committee thought that no further legislation was needed to archive this end.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.418" offset="2829040">Senate Committee however decided that in order to ensure the enforcement of the legislative intent, a provision emphasizing that intent should be inserted in the National Housing Act, and the Conference Committee agreed with this view and accordingly, Section 513 was added to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.008" offset="2895391">And it, one, expressly declares the consistent congressional purpose that housing projects subject to FHA insured mortgages are not to be used for hotel or transient purposes while the insurance remains outstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.761" offset="2946382">Secondly, provides subject to two exceptions, which do not pertain to this appellee, that no new existing or rehabilitated multifamily housing subject to an FHA insured mortgage maybe operated for such purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.439" offset="2997164">And three, directs the Federal Housing Commissioner to enforce the prohibition with all appropriate means at his disposal and authorize the Attorney General in the event that voluntary compliance not obtained, to obtain injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.885" offset="3054947">Now, the Court below has enjoined --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="740.275" offset="3064456">(Voice Overlap) before you get to that, how about those instances where the FHA did permit them to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.571" offset="3097684">Are they still operating in that manner, or were they enjoined?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_s_rosenthal" startTime="751.532" stopTime="765.256">
            <label>Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal</label>
            <text syncTime="751.532" offset="3109491">No, the -- if your Court pleases, the Congress recognized and the Congress felt that the FHA had misconstrued the statute a provision as to methods of operations, but the -- but the Congress recognized that there were these instances of expressed approval.</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="2036.158" offset="8247986">Not in the least, I have been fighting that for four years, and I'm right here still continuing that when you read the Act itself, that if you read the Act itself you will find that's an ingeniously worded piece of legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.424" offset="8305037">On its face, it would appear as if it did as the wording of the Act, to retroactively apply to the prior insured project.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.657" offset="8361984">But when you start analyzing the Act, where it states this Act and that Act, you will find that Congress has itself stated that this Act shall not apply to those projects that was insured prior to a State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.040" offset="8435545">In the 1954 Act that even goes farther than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.449" offset="8449128">It says that shall not apply to projects upon which a mere commitment had been issued prior to the effective date of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.013" offset="8487476">And I will say, if the Court pleases, if you will refer to the decisions in the two lower courts, you will find that they didn't come out and just say the Act was unconstitutional, they simply state that we simply hold that the terms of the 1954 Act cannot retroactively be applied to the Darlington apartments, implying that the Act -- the terms of the Act did not apply to those projects prior thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.485" offset="8649331">Now, I have at some length in the briefs here taken section by section of the 1954 Act and shown where the Act does not apply to projects insured prior to the date thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.671" offset="8730102">You will find that in my brief, it's set forth starting at page 63.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.503" offset="8785377">We take section by section and show that the wording of the Act does not apply to projects insured prior to the dates thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.967" offset="8823202">It has been however the contention of the Government throughout that the 1954 Act was constitutional and it could be retroactively applied to the prior situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.169" offset="8884015">It would be rather hard for me to take and go over this for the Court section by section, but I call your attention to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.893" offset="8918915">The enacting clause of the Housing Act states that this Act will be merely cited as the Housing Act of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.581" offset="8945664">Now, they distinguish it as I say, as separate act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.305" offset="8960606">The second paragraph state, "It had been the intent of Congress since the enactment of National Housing Act that housing built with aid to mortgage and insured under that Act, be used possibly for residential use and that such intent excludes the use of such housing for transient or hotel purposes."</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.905" offset="9031032">There was little interest in side like there that we mentioned in our brief but -- which Senator Capehart, who introduced this Act, that said it always would be the intent -- has always been the intent of Congress that it would be used for residential purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.138" offset="9087875">When asked about this Act before the Committee Hearing, they -- he said, "I can't tell you Senators what was the intention back there, and I wasn't him."</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.350" offset="9124760">So I respectfully submit that any approach of one Congress to declare what was the intent of another Congress literally goes into the use of (Inaudible) Board in my way of thinking, I don't see how they could tell what was the intent of another Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.574" offset="9185677">Certainly, the gentleman who presented this Act admitted that he couldn't tell what was the intent of the prior struggle.</text>

            <text syncTime="2301.593" offset="9309706">They went back and said that what one of the committees I think on -- forget the committee, had stated that it had never been intended to give the Indians a grant and that all they had was a easement to use the land and this Court views what that committee said then and they reached a decision as to whether a grant had been given to the Indians or not, that's under Sioux Indian case here that's cited in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.395" offset="9412942">Now, the third paragraph states that no multifamily housing with respect to which a mortgage insure under this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.530" offset="9441468">I take that to mean the 1954 Act, on page 68, shall be operated for transient or hotel purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.732" offset="9470307">The two stated exceptions however where projects operated for transient or hotel purposes maybe insured under the 1954 Act, where the Commission had agreed to such operations prior to May 28th, that was the date of the Committee Report to Congress, and where the project is located in an area which the Commission determines to be a resort area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.725" offset="9558288">To us, that is an unusual part of this Act, because in the discussion and on the Senate floor, Senator (Inaudible) who was taking care of the State of Florida said to Senator Capehart, said, "Does that exclude the whole State of Florida?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.968" offset="9615235">There was no misunderstanding about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.349" offset="9624743">Senator Capehart said, "It excludes the whole State of Florida and the statistics we have from the Federal Housing Administration is that there's 10,400 apartments in the State of Florida."</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.115" offset="9663822">That is excluded under this Act, had they been renting apartments prior to the effective date thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.974" offset="9691303">Now, we go to this, we submit the term of this Act as used in paragraph B specifically refers to the 1954 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.891" offset="9722964">Then if you go down to paragraph C, it says that no mortgage with respect to multifamily housing shall be insured under this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.000" offset="9751385">The Housing Act of 1954 are insured for an additional term unless the mortgagor agree he will not rent any part of the project for hotel or transient purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.676" offset="9794121">There is the significant thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.956" offset="9799241">They said that, "We won't increase it unless you agree that you won't do what you've been doing, but if you are willing for the same amount, you can keep on doing what you've been doing."</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.409" offset="9841037">You read this throughout that it would take all of my argument if I attempted to digress the -- I mean analyze the Act, you will find that the wording of the Act itself does not apply to projects insured before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.356" offset="9920763">The first three-judge court, this case got before, held that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.880" offset="9938944">The situation was this, we appeared before Judge Hoffman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.540" offset="9953573">Judge Hoffman thought there was a constitutional question involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.925" offset="9967052">He asked for a three-judge court, our late and beloved judge Parker called the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.659" offset="9990040">And then when the matter -- he called for brief and when we set it in the brief by a per curiam decision by Judge Parker, Judge Timmerman and Judge Hoffman, they sent it back to the Judge Hoffman and said, "We don't need a three-judge court here, this is a matter of simple statutory construction, does not involve the constitutionality of the Act."</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.866" offset="10070810">So then we went back and we had our day before Judge Hoffman and the matter was referred to this Court, and this Court thought there was a constitutional question and sent it back and we had our day before the three-judge court, and the three-judge court adopted the decision of Judge Hoffman and here we are now.</text>

            <text syncTime="2533.088" offset="10235695">One, I would not think so because I feel that the corporate charter in this case is in a grave deal like a lease or a restrictive covenants on the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.532" offset="10301524">And it is true that the -- the rules and regulations of the Federal Housing Administration which was not incorporated in the charter itself, but as a matter of law, becomes a part of the charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.521" offset="10349484">It said that it shall be designed, not used, principally for residential use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.942" offset="10371114">Second, it said that our corporation shall engage in the operation of a rental housing project, it's our contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.135" offset="10403924">And third, that preference must be given to veterans in the occupancy of the building.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.295" offset="10436524">It's our position that the courts below was correct when it simply held that we had a right to rent a reasonable number of apartments in the building and have them available for transient use if there was no demand otherwise, if there was no demand otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.560" offset="10537566">To me, this case involves, and we get away from the 1954 Act not applying to it, it involves this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.783" offset="10566510">Congress when it passed Section 608 of the Act and has set forth in the appellant's brief, and it's very brief law, and I tell you why it's a brief law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.811" offset="10622621">Congress was faced with a dilemma.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.286" offset="10632547">They needed housing, and the -- the boys were returning home, the -- the young fellows that had went out to war, come back as young men and they needed -- my friend here stated not hundreds or thousands of houses, but millions of houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.159" offset="10692002">Congress unlike in any other provision of the Housing Act, turned over to the Commissioner, said, "You go out and get these houses built, you use your emergency power and get these houses built."</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.684" offset="10742157">We placed no restriction on them at all, Congress placed no restriction on them at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.912" offset="10763055">And in not placing any restriction on -- on them at all, Congress had to eliminate a prior provision of an Act which this Act amended that had required them to be designed for principles laid for residential use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.182" offset="10816136">Now, having eliminated that, they said to the Commissioner, "You go out and get it."</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.347" offset="10832750">And here is what the Act said, the mortgage on property shall be held by a mortgagor, approved by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.569" offset="10865664">The Commissioner may, leaving it to his discretion, and his discretion requires such mortgagor to be regulated or restricted as to rents or sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.300" offset="10900564">Charges, capital structure, rate of return, methods of operations, rate or returns or methods of operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.861" offset="10926791">In that regard, I would like to say to the Court that he could have -- the Commissioner could have restricted the use of these apartments in any way he seen fit, Congress give him that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.706" offset="10978200">Congress further said, "If you are going to use that right, Mr. Commissioner, this is a manner in which you must use that right."</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.514" offset="11005471">The Commissioner may make such contract with and acquire but not exceeding $100 stock, or interest of any such mortgagor, as the Commissioner may deem necessary to render effective such restrictions and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.761" offset="11062418">Now, he did do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2780.879" offset="11226885">To create a private corporation to provide housing for rent or sale and to acquire any real estate or interest of right therein or pertinence thereto, in any and all personal property in connection therewith.</text>

            <text syncTime="2794.119" offset="11279862">To borrow money, and issue evidence of indebtedness in further of and all of the objects of his business, to secure the same for mortgage, deed of trust, pledge or lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.819" offset="11318627">Now, this is the two provisions I call your particular attention to is D and E, because I say this is our lease, this is the written contract that controls our methods of operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.031" offset="11367528">To apply for and obtained to be caused to be obtained from the Federal Housing Administration a contract, a contract to mortgage insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.210" offset="11396263">Pursuant to the provisions of the National Housing Act as amended, covering bonds, notes, other evidence of indebtedness issued by this corporation and any indent to a mortgage or deed of trust securing the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.423" offset="11441089">So long as any property of this corporation is encumbered by a mortgage or deed of trust, insured by the Federal Housing Commission, it shall engage in no business other than the construction and the operation of rental housing projects of such.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.107" offset="11487796">Now E, to enter into, perform and carry out contracts of any kind necessary to or in connection with the incidental accomplishment or any one or more purposes of this corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.900" offset="11538996">Then if you go further into this charter, you will find that the Commissioner gave consideration to the term of rentals, stated first, "You shall not rent any apartment for more than three years, nor can you rent all of the apartments in the building."</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.509" offset="11613393">But the Commissioner did not put any limitation expressly or impliedly anyway whatsoever on renting apartments for less than 30 days and there was good reasons why, because Senator Alben Barkley when he introduced this legislation, he stated in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.709" offset="11682252">He says, "An emergency is upon us, the emergency begets the need.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.361" offset="11700851">This Act, we will not introduce it as a part of the permit of Housing Act, but deals with permit or housing, we need temporary housing to serve the temporary needs of the veterans, many of them in schools," Senator Barkley said."</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.267" offset="11748394">Many of them is out seeking jobs, many of them don't know where the home would be, they need temporary housing now and I instruct the Federal Housing Commissioner to go out and use its emergency power to produce those houses."</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.501" offset="11805341">I submit that a project owner had one of these apartments, had a vacant apartment and a veteran who gets priority under the Act, knocked on his door and said, "I want to rent this apartment for two nights," how could the project owner under the law say to the veteran, "I won't let you have it for two nights, I am limiting this for 30- day rental."</text>
