            <label>Mr. David Berger</label>
            <text syncTime="18.745" offset="178343">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.678" offset="198092">I represent the petitioners, Huss, were a partnership were engaged in essentially the same kind of stripping and mining operation which was described by my colleague, Mr. McDowell.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.906" offset="255039">Now, we naturally agree with his outline to Your Honors of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.328" offset="276668">And it is our position that the statute which is here involved as a matter of law entitles the petitioners to the depletion allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.578" offset="317733">And we have printed the statute in our appendix at page 20 of our brief and in very plain language defines the gross income as to which the 5% depletion allowance shall be made as gross income from mining.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.963" offset="399235">It is therefore our position that on the facts of this case unchallenged, I may add, that the petitioners, Huss, derived over $1.5 million of gross income for the years 1944 to 1947, inclusive from mining and therefore, are within the plain language and the plain meaning of the statute entitled to the depletion allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.501" offset="529324">A question was asked from the bench this morning as to what if any label might have been attached to the interest of the parties, the petitioners here?</text>
            <text syncTime="119.397" offset="580942">To the extent that we have written contracts in this case, the Huss case differs factually from the Parsons case, which you will recall, was based on oral -- an oral arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.933" offset="647084">But at page 89 of the record, Your Honors --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="138.354" stopTime="143.189">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="138.354" offset="656802">There was no suggestion that in other cases the -- the contract wasn't intended (Inaudible)</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_berger" startTime="143.189" stopTime="332.226">
            <label>Mr. David Berger</label>
            <text syncTime="143.189" offset="676133">Oh no, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.327" offset="680730">No sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.776" offset="682506">It's just that I think for the enlightenment of all of us, it would be well to refer very briefly to the written contract which was one of six executed by Huss in this case and which I think very clearly demonstrates and indeed beyond for adventure of doubt, that the stripping and mining operations which produced the income here were mining operations within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.335" offset="800684">Now, the contract was a contract and this is the label put on it by the coal company, owner of the land, and drafted by the lawyers for the grantor of the interest which we had here.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.583" offset="865677">It says, “A contract for,” and I'm quoting, “stripping and mining the various veins on the north and south depths of the Tower City section.”</text>
            <text syncTime="201.280" offset="908518">And then it goes on to describe what the project is as a salvage stripping project, and at page 92 of the record it says, “Salvage stripping as used herein shall be deemed to mean a project wherein coal company reserves a coal-bearing area for contractor, gives contractor permission to enter upon this area and strip it and agrees to pay contractor a specified amount of money for each ton of raw coal that he delivers to coal company.”</text>
            <text syncTime="235.926" offset="1047071">And then it goes on to say that the coal company assumes no responsibility for the discovery of coal, gives the contractor no guarantee of the quantity of coal in the stripping area, and places upon contractor all risk in connection with the prospecting, discovery, and recovery of coal in the operation of the entire stripping project.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.415" offset="1141008">It goes on to require Huss to perform all work required for the prospecting, discovery, and recovery of all coal, the removal of overburden, and for the delivery of raw coal into the raw coal chute.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.223" offset="1200253">And then it expressly defines on page 94 the scope of the work as understood by the parties to refer to everything required too.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.998" offset="1239333">Now, these are the keywords, extract, process, and deliver into the raw coal chute at Westwood Breaker or of the raw coal that is recoverable by stripping.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.361" offset="1292831">And so we have, Your Honors, an agreement under which the owner of the coal land has reserved that coal-bearing track for the contractor, and has actually given to the petitioner in this case an exclusive right to strip and mine the coal, to recover all the coal recoverable, and requires itself to pay by taking all of his output only for the coal.</text>

            <text syncTime="334.835" offset="1442670">There was a cancellation clause in our written agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.803" offset="1458552">We are not in accord with the finding of the trial judge in this case who said that this cancellation clause was operable solely within the discretion of the coal company.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.450" offset="1509125">We think the record shows that on the contrary, that before Huss moved his very substantial equipment, worked in the end approximately $500,000, he asked at the beginning whether or not this clause which apparently permitted a -- an unqualified termination applied to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.029" offset="1599509">And he was advised that it didn't because it was something that was put in there as a precaution to protect the coal company against unsatisfactory strip miners.</text>

            <text syncTime="435.284" offset="1844537">Oh, on page 98, my colleague advises me, Article 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.822" offset="1870660">Now, it's rather lengthy but this is the point that we make in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.512" offset="1893439">We have a dual point.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.788" offset="1898559">First, that in respect to the cancellation clause, if you read this agreement through and I'm sure, Your Honors' leisure will -- your leisure will be able to do that, you will see that there -- the contractor was under an obligation to begin work within 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.249" offset="1964387">Now, the record shows that he was required and also under the contract to strip out and mine out all of the coal that is recoverable.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.590" offset="2001690">Now then, it is our position that the practice of the parties in respect to the six contracts in the Huss case demonstrates that they did not regard this as being in arrangement unilaterally terminable by Reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.562" offset="2065638">But on the contrary, and the record shows this, Your Honor, there are six written agreements of cancellation, each one covering each of the six contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.075" offset="2115688">Now, however, so there'll be no doubt as to the position of Huss, we say that while that clause was not applicable to Huss even if it should be regarded by this Court as applicable to Huss, that that would not deprive Huss of the right of depletion.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.109" offset="2199803">And we are relying upon the reasoning and the language of this Court in the Uplands case to which reference was made.</text>

            <text syncTime="671.540" offset="2789543">First of all, it was a 30-day notice provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="693.814" offset="2878673">Now, certainly no one can deny that while that clause remained unexercised that he, Huss, had a right to mine the coal.</text>

            <text syncTime="882.965" offset="3635284">So we had that economic interest.Moreover, for its entire income was derived solely from the extraction and delivery of the coal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1208.106" offset="4935764">But it is my belief that the cases are not that as difficult as they appear to be, that they really breakdown into three categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.101" offset="4971813">Category number one is the situation where the taxpayer, who was claiming depletion allowance, is the entrepreneur who actually drills the oil or mines the coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.234" offset="5024266">Category number two is the -- where the taxpayer does not himself drill the oil or mine the coal but by virtue of a legal relationship to the mineral, maintains control over its production to a certain extent and derives income directly from the oil or coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.498" offset="5117367">Now, category number three is where the taxpayer has some sort of tenuous connection with the mineral as a result of the production of which he gets some income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.633" offset="5169925">He might or might not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.812" offset="5174627">Now, where a case falls within category number one, there should be no doubt in anyone's mind that that taxpayer is entitled to depletion allowance because he comes plainly within the terms of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.451" offset="5241187">The difficulty has arisen in categories two and three.</text>

            <text syncTime="1290.823" offset="5266683">This Court has given the ultimate determination or a label, if I may use the word, by saying when it allows the depletion allowance, he has an economic interest and when it denies it he has only an economic advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.920" offset="5323003">Now, I have concluded that the cases which gave rise to the doctrine of economic advantage in this Court were cases where the person involved did not do the mining, did not do the drilling for oil, but got some kind of income as a result of a tenuous connection for -- and they came from a trilogy of cases decided on the same day by this Court 20 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.259" offset="5424358">And these cases were the Bankline, the Elbe case and the O'Donnell case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.074" offset="5443688">Now, the Bankline case, the taxpayer claimed the depletion allowance was merely a man who bought certain number of barrels of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.100" offset="5479737">That's all he did and he claimed that he had the right of depletion allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.320" offset="5492694">This Court said he doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.487" offset="5501367">I would say that a man who bought all the coal after it was finished would have no right to the depletion allowance, a coal broker.</text>

            <text syncTime="1460.109" offset="5943777">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.948" offset="5971153">As we see this case, it comes down to a search for some capital investment that the strippers made in the mineral in place here which would give rise to a right to depletion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.888" offset="6022875">The statute is designed to return to the taxpayer his capital represented by the wasting mineral asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.834" offset="6062686">The theory being, as Justice Brandeis stated speaking for the Court, that depletion is like depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.224" offset="6092257">The taxpayer has an asset represented by the mineral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.897" offset="6106990">As that asset is converted into cash, a portion of the cash represents a return of his capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.119" offset="6135829">It would be unfair to tax him on those proceeds without granting to him an offsetting deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.369" offset="6164877">So that it comes down to this as we see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.370" offset="6180864">Did the taxpayer have that kind of ownership interest in the mineral in place which entitles him to say, at least in part, this was my mineral?</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.703" offset="6226213">And as it is wasted, as it is exhausted, it is unfair to tax me on the proceeds I have obtained in connection with that mineral without granting the deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.600" offset="6281801">Now, the statute, insofar as it deals with the question of the parties who are entitled to the depletion deduction, says only the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.532" offset="6345540">In the case of leases, the deduction shall be equitably apportioned between the lessor and the lessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.252" offset="6376364">That is the fountainhead of the law on this subject as we have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.878" offset="6402905">Now, as it is, that section of the statute merely reiterates what this Court had already held before it was even enacted into law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.195" offset="6448149">In Lynch and all work Stevens, this Court stated dealing with the case of a lessee, the lessee is entitled to depletion because the exclusive possession of the deposits and the valuable right of removing and reducing the ore to ownership is a very real and substantial interest therein, it is property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.826" offset="6542712">And so, we say that is precisely what the statute enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.518" offset="6565491">The rule of the taxpayer must show he has a real and substantial interest which is property as represented by a capital investment in the mineral in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.107" offset="6611780">Now, after the statute was enacted, taxpayers made various claims in contesting each other's rights to the depletion deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.157" offset="6648038">Lessors argue that lessees were not entitled to it because under state law, title had not passed to the mineral and title was a material factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.465" offset="6685236">It was arguments of that type which were the occasion for this Court to formulate the economic interest test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.339" offset="6716688">And what we think the Court was in effect reaching for was a method of formulation which would describe the economic attributes of ownership held by the taxpayer which made it only fair that he receive depletion, although he might not have the particular legal incidence of title which might be required under any particular state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.107" offset="6811773">Now, the economic interest test, in fact, was stated by this Court in Palmer and Bender, which was a case where precisely that sort of argument was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.364" offset="6852838">And the economic interest test was restated by this Court time and again in cases dealing with lessees, sublessees, sublessors, assignees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.049" offset="6899545">And the Court said, “If you have an economic interest in the mineral, we are not concerned with the legal incidence of title here.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.436" offset="6941132">Now, as we see it then, the issue in this case is to determine whether the incidence of ownership which the taxpayer can be said to have acquired over the mineral in place, place him in a position similar to that of the lessor or lessee so that it can fairly be stated that the taxpayer has the capital investment in the mineral in place which makes it fair that he be given a return of capital tax-free as represented by the proceeds of the coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.228" offset="7092328">Now, when we turn to the specific facts in this case, we have a situation of a --</text>

            <text syncTime="1759.634" offset="7141857">-- we have a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.537" offset="7153560">Persons are engaged in the business of strip mining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.483" offset="7169337">Their job is to remove coal for the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.840" offset="7186683">Their job is then having removed it to turn it over to the owner and to be paid a fixed price for the services which they rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.247" offset="7232345">And the taxpayers here assert that that right to do a job, a right which in itself is terminable at will by the other side, a right which contains no control over the mineral itself, which grants no right of disposition over the mineral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.121" offset="7319907">That the rights which the taxpayers acquired under these contracts if they can be termed rights such as to entitle them to depletion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.593" offset="7357733">Now, the question here as we see it is the nature of the interest acquired by the taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.675" offset="7402036">Now, turning first to the terminable feature of these contracts, we say that that factor in and of itself shows that the taxpayers had nothing to deplete here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.551" offset="7461595">Whatever connection they had with the mineral, since it could be turned off at any time by the owner of the property, they had no real nexus with the mineral in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.132" offset="7507884">They had no interest in the mineral in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.398" offset="7516975">They can point to nothing for that reason which can be depleted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.751" offset="7538395">The application of such a test here is substantially similar to the kind of test this Court has applied in dealing with other kinds of transfers because essentially, the taxpayers are arguing here that they are transferees of some kind of an interest in the property, an economic interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.159" offset="7623973">Now, this Court has said in many other context that the right, the retention of an absolute power to revoke the transaction renders that transaction illusory for tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.083" offset="7679666">There has been no substantial transfer if the donor may revoke the gift at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.911" offset="7707042">There has been no substantial transfer -- transfer -- the transferor entrust, may cancel and revoke the trust at any time.He is still taxed on the income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.317" offset="7752600">He hasn't disposed off the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.239" offset="7760332">It remains in his gross estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.638" offset="7769945">And so, we say here that the retention of the absolute power to revoke in effect renders any transfer here illusory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.137" offset="7811950">The taxpayers got nothing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3511.664" offset="14149987">“Does the stripper have an economic interest in the mineral deposit?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.546" offset="14169527">And one of the -- one of the tests or one of the constituents in that ultimate finding has been stated by this Court as did the taxpayer, acquired by investment, any interest in the mineral in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.304" offset="14236609">And we say that the right of termination affects a decision on whether the stripper has complied with that requirement of attaining an economic interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.166" offset="14304005">There's been some question raised in the Huss case as to whether or not in fact, the coal company retained the 30-day right of termination, which is explicitly set forth in four of its written contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.107" offset="14379760">And whether it retained the absolute right of termination with no notice, which was explicitly set forth in another of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.931" offset="14419048">That is the same kind of factual contention which these taxpayers made to the District Court and lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.326" offset="14448724">They made it to the Court of Appeals and they lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.234" offset="14460322">They made it to the Court of Appeals on rehearing and they lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.022" offset="14475473">And we think that the finding of fact which has been sustained so many times ought -- ought to set the matter at rest here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.037" offset="14507551">In fact, there was testimony by the coal company that they had very good reason for putting these termination clauses in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.283" offset="14540466">They wanted to protect themselves if the whole operation became uneconomical for any reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.073" offset="14563662">They wanted to be able to pull out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.568" offset="14617684">Turning to the Southwest case, as we read that decision, the strippers can derive no comfort from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.661" offset="14661987">The upland owners, we submit, were in an entirely different position vis-a-vis the mineral than the strippers here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.472" offset="14701275">Here, before the agreements were signed, the strippers had no interest whatever in the mineral.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.179" offset="14728129">We submit they were the strangers to the lease which this Court referred to in the Southwest case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.572" offset="14757700">The strangers to the lease which this Court said, it was not -- it was not covering by its decision granting depletion to the upland owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.091" offset="14795734">The upland owners on the other hand, even before they entered into any agreement with the actual operator of the oil wells, had their land in such a position that it was in -- in a sense a proprietary interest in the oil in place by reason of the situation of their land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.833" offset="14878699">So that the Southwest case as we understand it is a case where this Court in effect held that the taxpayers had an interest before they entered the arrangement which was tantamount to an economic interest because their land was so situated with relation to the oil, that their land had a proprietary relationship to the oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.900" offset="14982980">So that we think in no event can the taxpayers rely upon the Southwest case further in the Southwest case of course, as -- as was already been indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.908" offset="15042957">The upland owners were in a real sense indispensable to the production of oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.545" offset="15069602">Absent the upland owners, there could be no production of oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.132" offset="15095933">If I may summarize the Government's position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.862" offset="15122787">As we see this case, the taxpayers have failed to demonstrate that the wasting mineral deposit represents a capital investment of theirs and that is the language which this Court has formulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.228" offset="15188302">The taxpayer must show that he has acquired by investment an interest in the mineral in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3778.072" offset="15215679">Now, we say that in effect means that the taxpayer must convert his capital from one form into another form.</text>
            <text syncTime="3789.446" offset="15261132">That other form is an interest in the mineral in place because the taxpayer here at no time had unfettered control over the mineral deposit or any substantial portion of it, because he had no right to dispose of the fruits of mining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.970" offset="15339290">For both of those reasons, we submit that he lacked those essential attributes of ownership which can be summed up in the phrase “a capital investment or capital interest in the mineral in place,” and therefore he should be denied reversal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3870.302" offset="15584632">-- I say that a finding of fact has not been sustained so many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="3874.597" offset="15601768">And if Your Honors will read the opinion of the Third Circuit, you will see that the position taken by the majority of the Third Circuit in effect was this whole thing is a question of fact for the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3885.966" offset="15647222">A reasonable man could reach different opinions, different results on the same evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3890.929" offset="15667075">And I feel that that was not a correct decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3894.610" offset="15681808">I feel that as a matter of law, we were right, we were entitled to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3898.511" offset="15697377">That they are winning or losing, the depletion allowance may not be rested or based in the uncontrolled or unreviewed discretion of a trial judge, that if we took Judge Van Dusen, we lose it, but if we got Judge Jackson, we might win it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3914.509" offset="15761429">Now, secondly, I'm surprised to hear government counsel say that he -- he offers no test when asked by this Court what is a test if my test of mining isn't the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3926.913" offset="15811062">On page 32 of the Government's brief they set forth the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3931.408" offset="15829034">And it is conceited, and I'm not going to waste my time for rebuttal in reading what they say except to paraphrase it to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3938.669" offset="15858082">And as I read, the plain language of page 32, they concede that a stripper may have an economic interest, then they give three situations in anyone of which he will have such an economic interest as to entitle him to depletion allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3953.026" offset="15915447">One, to mine all or a substantial portion of the track.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.656" offset="15929971">We had the right to and we did mined all of the track.</text>
            <text syncTime="3960.720" offset="15946271">Two, to extract a substantial number of tons of the mineral.</text>
            <text syncTime="3964.396" offset="15961004">We have the right to mine to exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3966.256" offset="15968423">We extracted almost a million tons of coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3969.662" offset="15982007">Three, to continue stripping operations for a sufficient time so that I can -- he can be certain of being able to remove a substantial amount of coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3979.223" offset="16020250">That is in the alternative, t says or three.</text>
            <text syncTime="3982.253" offset="16032371">We had that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3983.396" offset="16036968">Now, even if our right were subject to termination, the law has always protected contractual relationships terminable at will.</text>
            <text syncTime="3994.397" offset="16080959">If I am buying merchandise from you, sir, and a third-party should interfere with my purchasing of merchandise from you even though I may terminate it myself, that right can be actionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4007.886" offset="16134875">That termination can be -- that interference is actionable.</text>
