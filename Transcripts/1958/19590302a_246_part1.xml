            <text syncTime="29.681" offset="222124">Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.280" offset="236544">This case presents a question of the intended scope of Section 302 of the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.072" offset="271653">The defendant was indicted and convicted in the District Court of Puerto Rico after a jury trial for violation of subsection (b) of that Act and his conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.722" offset="330271">He contends in this Court in which he is proceeding in forma pauperis as he has throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.023" offset="355453">His conduct, which there was evidence, did not constitute an offense within Section 302 because the structure of the Act is of some significance to the resolution of the question, I will comment on it briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.098" offset="419715">Subsections (a) and (b), respectively, make it unlawful for an employer to pay to a union representative money and for a union representative to receive money from the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.476" offset="473318">Subsection (c) in form halves out exceptions to the foregoing flat prohibitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.823" offset="502680">The most important ones of which are the payment of the dues of union members deducted by the employer pursuant to duly authorized check off and the one involved in this case, payment by the employer to a trust fund established by the union for the payment of welfare benefits pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.957" offset="595153">Subsection (d) of the Act makes the willful violation of the section a misdemeanor, and subsection (e) of the Act gives to the Federal District Courts equity jurisdiction without regard to the provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act to restrain violations of the section.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.042" offset="683551">The defendant was indicted in 1955 for a violation of subsection (d) in that he received $15,000 from two employers on February 24th, 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.326" offset="736632">At that time, he was the president of a Puerto Rican local of the International Longshoremen's Association which represented units of employees of two Puerto Rican sugar processing concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.473" offset="785220">In February of that year, the defendant, on behalf of his local, had negotiated with the employers the collective bargaining agreement for the ensuing three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.242" offset="832345">The Government's -- that agreement contained an expressed provision for the establishment of a welfare fund to be administered jointly by the employer and the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.632" offset="873932">The Government's evidence was that at the signing of the agreement, the defendant requested that the employer's two checks to be their contribution to the fund pursuant to the terms of the agreement in the amount of $7500 each to be delivered to him in order that he might exhibit them to the union members at a meeting that night.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.229" offset="952299">These checks were made payable to the union not to the defendant and each had attached to it a voucher expressly stating that it constituted the employer's contribution to the union welfare fund established under the collective bargaining agreement signed that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.105" offset="1023770">This was February 21st.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.136" offset="1031920">On February 24th, the defendant deposited the checks endorsed by the secretary of the local and by himself in a Puerto Rican bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.742" offset="1066297">The account was expressly in the name of the pension fund or whether the welfare fund of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.192" offset="1092106">It appeared that the single prior fund established in this industry that is between this employer and this union had been deposited in a different Puerto Rican bank, but it did not appear that in any other respects, the establishment of the fund by deposit differed from the prior practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.300" offset="1156577">This was February 24th.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.749" offset="1162324">On March 2nd, the defendant presented to that bank a resolution signed by officers of the local authorizing him to withdraw checks from the fund on his sole signature.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.881" offset="1210911">At the trial, one of the alleged signers of the resolution denied his signature.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.280" offset="1228466">However, there was evidence which was not contradicted that other officers of the local had, in fact, signed the resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.226" offset="1256260">Admittedly, the practice as to the single prior fund established in this unit by the union had been to have the checks from the welfare fund countersigned by the employer representative and by the defendant as the representative of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.648" offset="1318013">This was on March 2nd.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.242" offset="1324387">The first withdrawal from the fund was on March 16th, that is the first withdrawal on which the Government introduced evidence, on March 16th, almost three weeks after the date as of which the defendant is alleged to have violated the Act by receiving money from the employer and almost a month after the date as to which he actually took physical possession of the two checks for $15,000, there was evidence which was introduced over the strenuous objection of the defendant that some of these withdrawals were for the personal benefit of the defendant or for board union but non-welfare fund purposes such as the purchase of office files and equipment and the payment of union salaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.031" offset="1503483">The case was -- the -- this evidence indicated that on March 26th, the balance remaining on the first bank account was withdrawn by the defendant and deposited in another bank account in a general union account as to which he again had sole power of withdrawal.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.455" offset="1573177">And the Government again presented evidence over objection as to withdrawals in this account extending through April 14th, 1953 or almost two months after the period as to which the defendant was alleged to have violated the Act by receiving money from the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.808" offset="1638588">The case was submitted to the jury on instructions that if you should find that the defendant had complete and sole control of the fund either as of the time he received the checks or as of the time he deposited them on the bank, you should find the defendant guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.800" offset="1702536">One other fact is relevant, we believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.085" offset="1715702">The Government conceded several times in the proceeding below that the employers had not violated the Act because they had made their payments bona fide within the exemption of subsection (c), namely, to a trust fund established by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.263" offset="1784456">The petitioner's position is that on such a record, whatever might be true on an indictment for embezzlement or some other crime, a violation of Section 302 was not made out.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.035" offset="1831476">Quite the contrary, we say that the evidence shows a payment to the -- by the employer to the defendant within the expressed exemption of subsection (c) covering payments by the employer to a union welfare fund established by collective bargaining agreement.</text>

            <label>Mr. John R. Hally</label>
            <text syncTime="541.223" offset="2268244">Well, I would take advantage of the fact that the statute doesn't say that, but I think that the trust fund had -- had vitality here as shown by the evidence of the employer's attempt to participate in this administration in the evidence in the case that at a subsequent period, the defendant discussed his administration of the fund with the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.300" offset="2352567">In any event, I wouldn't think that that intent theory in which the Government relies on an appeal would necessarily bear upon the suggestion Your Honor made.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.308" offset="2400632">In other words, in that case, the control theory on which the case was submitted to the jury might be more relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.287" offset="2420485">But the Government here is proceeding upon a theory that the defendant's guilt depends upon the intent with which he receives the money.</text>

            <text syncTime="621.256" offset="2588400">That is a portion of the defendant's case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.170" offset="2604074">In other words, this statute is malum prohibitum.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.698" offset="2618180">And we think that the Act which produces criminality should be definite and precise.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.234" offset="2640332">There having been a concession that the payment was made to the trust fund within the exception, we say that absent proof that there was a sham considered in by both the employer and the defendant to make this a bribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.278" offset="2696443">But absent that, the determination of criminality should depend upon those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.196" offset="2716191">And we rely upon the facts that subsection (e) of the Act gives equity jurisdiction to the federal courts to restrain and prevent violations of the so-called trust fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.780" offset="2762480">In other words, Congress had before.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.337" offset="2768750">And at the time of enactment of 302, evidence that union leaders had used these trust funds for purposes other than that which the employer had purportedly paid them over.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.253" offset="2824338">One of the things they were particularly concerned with was the use for political purposes or strike funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.965" offset="2851192">Accordingly, Congress wrote in to subsection (c) a series of regulations as to how the fund should be administered, limited purposes upon which it could be expended.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.392" offset="2888913">But since the use of those moneys for those broad purposes would not have been criminal in 1947 and 1948, we suggest that you cannot infer now or cannot infer that Congress had in 1947 and 1948 an intent to make them criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.302" offset="2940531">Instead, you have to look at the scheme of draftsmanship of 302 and conclude that in giving equity jurisdiction in subsection (e), Congress was looking to the federal courts to have power to restrain these post payment episodes and incidents in a manner in which a probate court or a court in equity would administer a trust, in other words, on the civil side.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.903" offset="3026944">And what the Government is attempting to do here is to retroactively create criminality from episodes, events which really occurred one month, even two months after the period of the event of which the indictment deals with the payment and receipt.</text>

            <text syncTime="759.703" offset="3142196">We say that is the only case of sham.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.018" offset="3151496">One of the arguments of the Government here is that our argument produces the possibility of sham.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.158" offset="3168005">We say it produces the possibility of sham only if you concede, assuming the first case, that the case is within the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.830" offset="3194650">Clearly, if the employer intended to buy the union representative by casting it in a form of payment to the welfare fund and the evidence was adduced that both sides knew it, then it would be a case of bribery within the expressed purpose of (a) and (b) because that is another reason why we say quite apart from literally applying the language of the statute to our acts, we rely on something broader than that, although we feel that under principles of strict construction of criminal statutes, it would be sufficient for us to do as I have done in the preceding portion of my argument, literally apply the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.544" offset="3321501">But we rely upon the fact that the legislative history of 1947 and 1948 shows that subsections (a) and (b) were directed to the twin crimes of bribery and extortion and the impediments they imposed upon collective bargaining since it is clear that what happened here was neither bribery nor extortion, we say that the Act does not apply, that is subsection (b) does not apply to defendant's conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.494" offset="3409377">The Government has reviewed the legislative history which is put out in our brief into a greater extent in the Government's brief, and agrees with us that the prime purpose of subsections (a) and (b) was the prevention of bribery and extortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.104" offset="3463816">However, it argues an additional generalized purpose, which I shall discuss in a moment.</text>

            <text syncTime="859.029" offset="3539466">This would be a case governed by insular law.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.825" offset="3550647">And the record shows on page 20 that at the time the defendant proceeded to trial here, there was an insular indictment that is in the state courts to the island courts for embezzlement pending against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.293" offset="3604564">And so, in the sense, that comes back to our case that the -- there is no need to stretch 302 to deal with the facts of this case because it was either dealt with by state or insular law.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.307" offset="3656600">It is dealt with the state and insular law if it is an embezzlement and that the jury shall find on a charge of indictment for embezzlement or 302 was not intended to deal with it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1456.409" offset="5929044">I -- I do, aided by Your Honor's suggestion, come to that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.203" offset="5952136">To advert again to the Government's theory that the jury were instructed that the intent with which the defendant took this money and approved that intent, they go back to the subsequent takings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.970" offset="5995290">It was crucial to his guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.659" offset="6001977">We say the short answer to that is that the case was not tried on that theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.407" offset="6024965">The instructions of the judge to the Court were repeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.651" offset="6041997">They appear principally on Record 237, that if you find the defendant had complete and sole control over the funds, and that's said twice on that page, you shall find him guilty, a known instruction as of which the defendant's guilt depended upon the intent with which he received the money, the word “intent” which is certainly a word of art in the criminal law, would have been crucial in the instruction with reference to the defendant's act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.006" offset="6135411">But that word, that particular word is no way used -- the word “objective” is -- the word “intent” is no way used in the judge's instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.628" offset="6169893">And certainly, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit didn't deal with this case as having been presented to the jury on any theory that the defendant's guilt depended upon his intent in taking the money, it analyzed it that his guilt depended upon the control.</text>

            <text syncTime="1531.460" offset="6229243">Well, intendment would be an important factor because you turn to answer Justice Douglas is that employer pay money ostensibly to a trust fund but knowing that it was a phony trust fund, the courts here would be not within the exception under (Inaudible)</text>

            <text syncTime="1549.465" offset="6301236">Well, I think even in that case, the evidence might proceed without particular examination into the subjective intents of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.708" offset="6334255">For example, if it were shown that the employer said something about he was going to pay off the fellow or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.386" offset="6360900">In other words, it would be -- it -- I don't think intent, the statute after all is malum prohibitum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.751" offset="6382425">And this Court has so characterized that the intent should be crucial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.864" offset="6402800">And I would not admit to an intent, of course, possibly to determine whether there had been a sham payment intent might become relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.290" offset="6436551">But certainly, not in this case where there is no evidence of possibility of contention of sham.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.391" offset="6456926">The -- as I say, the principal -- the dispositive answer to the Government's argument is the case was not tried on this theory of intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.426" offset="6489109">And as this Court said in Jones against the United States last term, the Government cannot sustain on appeal a case or a conviction on a theory which is not supported by the record below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.640" offset="6533935">The principal other reason why we feel that the statute or the Government's theory, particularly, is not supported or is not correct, is that they misread the scheme of draftsmanship of 302 and ignore the equity jurisdiction given in subsection (e) to the courts to restrain these post event -- these post payment and receipt activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.050" offset="6615542">Congress didn't intend to make them criminal on the basis of the acts and events appearing days, weeks and months after the payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.229" offset="6648247">The event surrounding the fact of payment was where to determine criminality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.299" offset="6668518">The subsequent activities which might constitute an abuse of trust would be covered by the equity powers of court.</text>
