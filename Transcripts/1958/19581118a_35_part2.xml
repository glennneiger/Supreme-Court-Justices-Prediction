            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">Mr. Ennis, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward J. Ennis</label>
            <text syncTime="6.460" offset="130257">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.855" offset="139766">When the Court rose for lunch, we had -- I had reached in the statement of facts, which I'll make very brief, the place where the petitioner, Barenblatt, had been summoned to Washington for a hearing and the hearing which begins at page 173 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.007" offset="224402">And the first witness was a Mr. Crowley, whom he had known in the University of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.124" offset="252928">And Mr. Crowley, who had refused to answer on a former occasion, came back to tell his story without a subpoena on this occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.844" offset="291798">And as the Chairman said that the field covered will be communism in education and the experiences and background in the Party of Francis X.T. Crowley.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.250" offset="333385">Now, very briefly, Mr. Crowley, testified that his experience with the Communist Party was that, while in the first year in College in Columbia, he had lost his religious faith and he was looking around for another one and an older woman, a member of the Communist Party had introduced him into a Communist Party and that he then served, he delivered the -- the daily -- the Daily Worker and worked for the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.142" offset="452921">And finally, a year or two later, after wandering around in various jobs within the -- the University of Michigan undergraduate school, where he said his membership, which he had taken out in New York, was transferred to Michigan and there he was a member of the Neophytes Club in the undergraduate school, which apparently was a club named after someone allegedly a Communist, a member of the Communist Party of the United States who had died in the Spanish Civil War.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.996" offset="588340">Now, Mr. Crowley said that after he had refused to testify and had been cited for contempt, he was working on a construction job of the church.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.020" offset="636510">He was helping to construct the church and in connection with that work he met -- he met a priest who told him he really ought to go Washington and tell a story.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.475" offset="670260">So Mr. Crowley then undertook to tell a story.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.880" offset="683948">Now, what he told about Michigan after first about his experiences in New York and Boston, what he told about Michigan was that he named some dozens of persons who had been members of the Neophytes Club and whom he said were members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.725" offset="759286">And then he named a number of persons who were members of the Haldane Club of the graduate school.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.126" offset="792931">The Haldane Club of the Communist Party apparently named after the English scientist.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.150" offset="821039">And among the names he gave --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="180.508" stopTime="184.582">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="180.508" offset="826472">I was hoping he'd be the Lord Chancellor and of course by the --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edward_j_ennis" startTime="184.582" stopTime="251.869">
            <label>Mr. Edward J. Ennis</label>
            <text syncTime="184.582" offset="842773">The record doesn't show.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.564" offset="846639">That was only my assumption, Your Honor, from some of the -- Mr. Haldane's works and statement that it was after the scientist.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.363" offset="881852">And he finally got around to naming a Barenblatt.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.609" offset="902855">And about him he said -- very simply, he said, “He was a member, but I know he's out of the Party and that he has no -- no further interests in it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="207.347" offset="933784">And he was cut short on that and they said, "No, we'll ask Mr. Barenblatt about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.896" offset="951965">Just tell us the names and if Barenblatt is one of them, that's all we want from you."</text>
            <text syncTime="216.860" offset="971818">So then another -- another person was called who he -- who he named in this -- in this rather long testimony, which he named perhaps for more than a score of people, and then Barenblatt is called.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.814" offset="1051648">There was no effort to state to him in any formal way, this was a court before the Washington -- decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.573" offset="1078711">There was no effort to state in any formal way the nature of the inquiry or the pertinency of the questions which were to be asked of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.748" offset="1111416">But he was asked --</text>

            <text syncTime="268.453" offset="1178185">Your Honor, you take me by surprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.086" offset="1184768">I have not seen the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.656" offset="1195008">It was -- I don't believe made part of the -- of the prosecution in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.279" offset="1217473">And perhaps my Brother, Mr. Monahan, will be able to help the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.960" offset="1232206">I'm -- I just don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.404" offset="1238058">All I know is there's a subpoena to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.008" offset="1248402">And he -- at the outset, or after giving some identifying data about his age and where he had worked until he received the subpoena, he very early in the record, stated his position that he would not answer any questions in respect to former membership or present membership in either the Communist Party as such or in the Haldane, a club of the Communist Party of Michigan, nor would he answer a question as to whether he knew Crowley.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.684" offset="1375148">He said, "I knew him."</text>
            <text syncTime="318.608" offset="1378806">But he would not answer as to whether he knew him as a Communist.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.983" offset="1392285">And the five questions, indictment questions were, “Are you a Communist?”</text>
            <text syncTime="327.251" offset="1413392">One.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.978" offset="1416317">Two, "Have you been a Communist?"</text>
            <text syncTime="329.789" offset="1423527">Three, "Were you a member of the -- rather, are you a member of the Communist Party?</text>
            <text syncTime="333.592" offset="1438783">Were you a member of the Communist Party?"</text>
            <text syncTime="334.700" offset="1443171">Third, "Were you a member of the Haldane Club of the Communist Party?</text>
            <text syncTime="337.974" offset="1456337">Did you now -- know Crowley as a Communist?"</text>
            <text syncTime="340.825" offset="1467726">And the fifth question on which he was indicted, “Were you a member of some counsel of cultural -- I have it here, another organization which existed on the Michigan campus?"</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="351.363" offset="1509836">Is it factually true, as is represented in the briefs, I think, that the petitioner here had been present in the room during the day, when Mr. Crowley had testified that he was a Communist, had been a Communist?</text>

          <turn speaker="edward_j_ennis" startTime="365.134" stopTime="386.912">
            <label>Mr. Edward J. Ennis</label>
            <text syncTime="365.134" offset="1564902">The record supports the -- the contention that he was present at certainly -- at some time during the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.705" offset="1611191">He was called down to be present that day and he wasn't told that he'd be called for particular hours so -- and as the record -- his own testimony indicates that he was in the -- in the hearing.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="386.912" stopTime="394.899">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="386.912" offset="1652046">So that he had heard Mr. Crowley testify under oath that -- that he, Mr. Crowley, had been a Communist?</text>

          <turn speaker="edward_j_ennis" startTime="394.899" stopTime="596.801">
            <label>Mr. Edward J. Ennis</label>
            <text syncTime="394.899" offset="1684020">I'm not prepared to go so far as to say that he heard that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.818" offset="1699694">He admitted that he was present during the hearing and I think, it would not be an unfair -- an unfair assumption to say that he was present during this important part for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.342" offset="1753715">Oh, the subpoena -- Mr. Monahan is -- is kind enough to advise me that the subpoena appears at page -- at page 70 of the record."</text>
            <text syncTime="424.462" offset="1802198">And commanded to appear before the Committee and to testify touching matters of inquiry committed to said Committee and not to depart without leave of the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.928" offset="1840128">There was no description of the purpose of the inquiry in the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.468" offset="1862280">Now, Mr. Crowley, just before being asked to identify these members of the Haldane Club, he stated and this appears on page 204 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.431" offset="1906166">In answer to the question, what sort of activities did the Haldane Group engage in?</text>
            <text syncTime="454.180" offset="1921108">And he answered, “They were chiefly of an intellectual nature discussing things.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.850" offset="1939811">It was mainly a discussion group.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.496" offset="1950365">There was very little of the activity of the kind that the Neophytes engaged in, that was the undergraduate club, that is running around the campus with petitions or things like that."</text>
            <text syncTime="471.310" offset="1989653">Now, when he refused to -- when Barenblatt, the petitioner, refused to answer the questions, he tried to make a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.938" offset="2028105">He had quite a long statement, 10 or 11 pages with him, which he said explained his reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.178" offset="2049108">It was a good bit of colloquy back and forth with the Committee, as to whether he'd be allowed to make the statement because he hadn't submitted to the Committee according to its rules in advance of the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.842" offset="2087769">But finally, they allowed him to put the statement in the record as his explanation of why he would not answer the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.746" offset="2123400">And that statement appears beginning on page 227 of the records.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.377" offset="2149940">And it gives his reasons for -- that he felt that this intrusion on his personal affairs was an unwarranted -- was unwarranted and that the Committee did not have the authority and indeed the Congress did not have the authority under the cause of the First Amendment to authorize this intrusion on his affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.143" offset="2233010">Now, Barenblatt was convicted before the -- he -- he agreed to waive a jury during the trial and he was convicted by -- by the District Court without a jury, and given a sentence of six months and a $250 fine, which the Court of Appeals affirmed and this Court having granted certiorari, sent the case back for reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.253" offset="2337395">Now, the second -- the second opinion of the Court in the light of Watkins and Sweezy, and the two dissenting -- these two dissenting opinions present for consideration to this Court, petitioner submits, three questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.825" offset="2403746">One, whether the -- he was properly advised that the questions about his Communist Party membership was pertinent to the subject under inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.437" offset="2454110">The second question, whether Congress authorized the Committee to make an investigation of communism in education.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="596.801" offset="2491622">Did he make any -- any inquiry as to what the purpose of the question was?</text>

          <turn speaker="edward_j_ennis" startTime="601.765" stopTime="860.945">
            <label>Mr. Edward J. Ennis</label>
            <text syncTime="601.765" offset="2511475">The -- the answer to that, Your Honor, is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.403" offset="2525999">He was called as the last witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.237" offset="2537388">There was no formal statement by the Committee to him as to what the purpose was.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.898" offset="2559958">Now, as to whether he made a sufficient objection, if one is required, all I can point Your Honor to is on this Exhibit 1, if -- which is his written statement accepted by the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.598" offset="2610740">If Your Honor, will look at the bottom of page 228 and the top of page 229, where he speaks of -- of the -- his objection to being questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.618" offset="2658910">And he says, “That they, the Congress, cannot by resolution increase their constitutional authority as was said by the Supreme Court in the Jones case."</text>
            <text syncTime="648.114" offset="2696840">Now, if he adopted this language as his own, I think he asked for an explanation by the Committee of pertinency.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.920" offset="2728082">The citizen when interrogated about his private affairs has a right before answering to know why the inquiry is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.484" offset="2762355">And if the purpose disclosed is not a legitimate one, he may not be compelled to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.095" offset="2784820">Now to answer -- Mr. Justice Harlan, to answer you in all frankness, just as there was not a statement by the Committee as to the nature of the inquiry or the pertinency of the question, there was no clear statement by the Committee nor by the petitioner, was there a clear objection on that ground?</text>
            <text syncTime="689.428" offset="2862143">All I can submit to Your Honors on this point, is that at this time in 19 -- June 28th, 1954, before either witnesses or counsel had the advantage of the Watkins decision, these things were not as competently or technically handled as they were in later hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.021" offset="2936435">I submit that on this question, and I will address myself to it very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.067" offset="2968618">On this question of pertinency that it was the Committee's obligation to give him some kind of a statement as to the nature of the inquiry, so that he could judge at the peril of criminal conviction whether he should refuse to answer on the ground of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.060" offset="3060673">And I submit that the general statement which I've read, that the purpose of the hearing at the beginning of Crowley's testimony, that the purpose of the hearing in -- is in the main, communism in education and the experiences of Crowley in the Party that he could very well believe that the -- what the Committee's purpose was -- was to give Crowley the opportunity to get out from under the contempt citation and to tell the Committee what he knew and to explain his experiences in the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.418" offset="3206019">And certainly, if that was a subject of the inquiry, as the Chairman at the beginning of Crowley's testimony says it was, that it was not pertinent to that inquiry about Crowley's experiences in the Party to ask Barenblatt whether he was a member of the Haldane Club as a Communist Party in the University of Michigan.</text>

            <text syncTime="1222.055" offset="4992585">Certainly, if Communist -- certainly the Congress of the United States and the House, knows how to use the word, communism and the word education, if they want to authorize an investigation of communism in education and certainly they have not used this language here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.413" offset="5066041">Now, I'm going to rest on the Court's opinion on the Watkins case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1255.326" offset="5125705">The Government obviously doesn't argue with the Court's language in the Watkins case condemning the vagueness of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.273" offset="5165516">But the Government says; “Well, let's not worry about the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.598" offset="5182757">Let's look at what the members of Congress said in 1938 when this language was adopted.This language has been unchanged since its initial formulation setting up the Dies Committee in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.748" offset="5235419">And the Government in its brief says, “Well, there was a lot talk on the floor of the House when this was adopted by members, talking about communism.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.026" offset="5288500">So, clearly by Un-American propaganda and propaganda instigated from abroad that attacks the principles of the form of Government as guaranteed by a Constitution and some of the Congressmen mentioned communism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.558" offset="5338655">They certainly intended to include communism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.094" offset="5352761">And that doesn't quite get education here, but they say, “Now, we're going to find education in this language by looking at the fact that when this investigation of education was going on during the years of 1953 and 1954, the Committee filed reports with Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.349" offset="5425800">And Congress made an appropriation which at the time when Congress knew that its committee was investigating education, and that constitutes -- that imports into the language some kind of authority to investigate communism in education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.324" offset="5497689">Now, about all I can say about this is that you cannot substitute for the language of the resolution, either appropriations by Congress or statements on the floor of the House.</text>

            <text syncTime="2114.934" offset="8564151">Now, in the last two cases, we've heard and I'm not going to bother the Court with the rephrasing of this balance of public versus private interests, the right to be led alone versus the public interest to know.</text>

            <text syncTime="2235.628" offset="9046894">The purpose of this investigation as stated by the Committee because, if as we contend, the Committee's position was that we are going to investigate what Communists are thinking about, what they're teaching without any relation to overthrow the Government by force or violence, if that was the thrust and purpose of the investigation, it is plainly unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.078" offset="9176670">Now, what does the Committee say about it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.884" offset="9191926">Well, on page 70 -- on page 79 of the record, this is at the beginning of the hearings on Communist methods of infiltration and education.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.549" offset="9234557">The preceding year, not at which Barenblatt was called, but in which at the beginning of the hearing, when they called their two principal witnesses, Mr. Davis, Robert Gorham Davis, and Granville Hicks, in the prior year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.124" offset="9288892">And the Committee Chairman says that the Committee is concerned with the opportunities that the Communist is equally concerned with the opportunities the Communist Party has to wield its influence upon members of the teaching profession and students to Communists who are members of the teaching profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.872" offset="9355870">Now, it's our contention and I'll try and support it by a couple of other statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.141" offset="9373006">If this committee very frankly said that what we're going to investigate in education is what the Communist teachers are thinking about, what they're talking about, what they're teaching without any attempted relation of thought, whether we like the thought or not, but are any attempt to relate that thought to action against our Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.708" offset="9475197">Now, Mr. Davis, the first principal witness on page 91 of the record, he was asked by -- by Mr. Tavener, the Committee counsel, what were you Communist teachers in the Teachers Union up to, what were you doing?</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.999" offset="9540399">And the question is, "Do the group of Communists who are working within the Teachers Union sponsor the passage of resolutions with the Communist Party as a whole, was interested in having endorsed or adopted by various groups?</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.027" offset="9580523">The witness, “Yes."</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.733" offset="9583344">Mr. Tavener, "Can you recall any specific instance?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.429" offset="9594107">Mr. Davis, “No, I can't, but they would have to do with the national political situation at that time.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.169" offset="9617095">The Communist supported the new deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.857" offset="9627857">Supported the Roosevelt administration until the Russian Pact of 1939 and many of them measured which they supported where I think, could measure as against anti-Semitism, against fascism for minority rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.356" offset="9681774">We think that statement also supports the idea that this committee did not understand the constitutional restrictions on its investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.923" offset="9720121">It was trying to find out what Communist thought was being banded about.</text>

            <text syncTime="2834.668" offset="11443054">It is horrible enough to lose 13 Americans to Red China as a result of the war, especially when the war was not of America's choosing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.951" offset="11472206">It is far more horrible to lose one American to the Communist conspiracy through a teacher in a free educational institution in America.</text>

            <text syncTime="2862.249" offset="11553395">But I also submit to this Court that it is not for -- it is not within the realm of the Committee of Congress to make that the subject of its investigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2896.663" offset="11691008">I think this statement makes it clear that this committee misunderstood the -- the scope of its constitutional investigative authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="2919.366" offset="11781810">I would explain this record to you a little bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.969" offset="11792259">This record contains principally the parts of the hearings which are eight parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.759" offset="11823397">A copy has been deposited with the Court of all the hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.278" offset="11841473">One to eight on this investigation of -- of the Committee, but this contains principally the parts which the Government offered upon a trial in the District Court of Barenblatt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.716" offset="11887240">It wanted to call quite properly to -- to the District Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.475" offset="11910332">The parts of the record which itself, would establish a legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.860" offset="11931857">So, it offered in evidence, two sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.152" offset="11948993">The first section, 1953 hearings and the 1954 hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.379" offset="11973862">And that's what this record contains.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.994" offset="11980340">Now, we have cited in our brief in addition to references from the record, we cited on the references in the hearings of set of which have been deposited with the Court and which I believe the Court will take judicial notice, showing other numerous statements with this House Un-American Activities Committee, just made it plain and it felt it had the entire field of investigation of communism in education without making any distinction whatever, between what was merely thought, expression and association and what was a conspiracy or concerted action to overthrow our Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.354" offset="12133836">Ignored it completely, not only ignored it, but devoted itself entirely to the legal area and made no attempt to tie any of this up with attempt to overthrow the Government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.995" offset="12188379">Now, I need -- I hardly need to say that this kind of an investigation, if my statement is fit -- and if this is the kind of an investigation that this committee was running, I need hardly labor the point that it certainly inhibited freedom of speech and thought and freedom of expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.318" offset="12273643">What is the Committee's idea?</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.595" offset="12282734">Is it -- is it the Committee's idea that if you want to be a Communist, you can read Das Kapital in your library, but don't talk to anybody about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.924" offset="12324112">Don't communicate this -- this dangerous disease to anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.905" offset="12343965">Don't join in any organization whether you're called at the Communist Party or the Haldane Club to do this -- to have discussions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.430" offset="12374162">And what does Crowley say?</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.767" offset="12379491">Crowley himself says the Haldane Club was a discussion group.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.541" offset="12394538">They were not activists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.450" offset="12398195">They like to talk about these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.143" offset="12408957">Now, obviously, the First Amendment not only permits you to read and think about Communism, but it permits you to associate with other people, like-minded people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.994" offset="12452321">And if you do -- do all of this short of -- short of the advocating immediate overthrow of our Government, it's protected by the First Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3424.832" offset="13803687">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.142" offset="13820928">Mr. Justice Stewart asked the question of whether under the Watkins decision, it was necessary for a witness to object to the alleged lack of pertinency of a question in order later to raise the issue at his criminal trial for contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.097" offset="13936807">If I may, Mr. Justice Stewart, I would like to answer your question in the words of the Watkins opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.789" offset="13963557">On page 214 of the Watkins opinion, the fourth line from the bottom and this portion of the opinion in the Government's view contains the essence of the holding of the Watkins decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.632" offset="14034923">"Unless the subject matter has been made to appear with undisputable clarity, it is the duty of the investigative body upon objection of the witness on grounds of pertinency to state for the record the subject under inquiry at that time and the manner in which the propounded questions are pertinent thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.554" offset="14134606">To be meaningful, the explanation must describe what the topic under inquiry is and the connective reasoning whereby the precise questions asked relate to it."</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.307" offset="14185597">In the case at bar, there was no objection by Mr. Barenblatt or by his counsel to the pertinency of the questions which he was asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.859" offset="14231782">Mr. Ennis has referred to a quotation from an opinion of this Court in the Jones case, which appeared in approximately the middle of an 11-page legal brief, which was filed with the Committee by Mr. Barenblatt, in which he objected to the Committee's jurisdiction under the First Amendment, the Ninth Amendment, the Tenth Amendment, the constitutional prohibition against bills of attainder, ex post facto legislation and the constitutional separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.944" offset="14392174">I submit, if it please the Court, that it does not require an 11-page legal brief to make a simple objection that a question is not pertinent to the subject under inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.547" offset="14434597">But our argument does not rest upon that alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.760" offset="14447449">We submit that the subject was -- was in any event crystal clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.654" offset="14463018">Mr. Justice Clark had pointed out that at the beginning of these hearings in 1953, Chairman Velde made a two or three-page long statement of the -- of the purpose of the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.853" offset="14519860">And I recommend to the Court that it read that language which -- which appears in the beginning of page 73 of the record and it will -- it's very clear from that just what the purpose of the -- of the investigation was, namely communism in education.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.884" offset="14599899">Now, it's true that Mr. Barenblatt was not present at that time, but I take it that it is not necessary for the Chairman of the Committee to repeat that -- the purpose of the Committee each day of our investigation and for each witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.608" offset="14654861">But in it, but -- but further than that, when Mr. Barenblatt appeared that there was a brief -- a brief repetition of the purpose of the Committee when the counsel for the Committee in introducing Mr. Crowley to the Committee -- and Mr. Crowley testified just shortly before Mr. Barenblatt, that the purpose was to -- to pursue the Committee's inquiry into communism in education.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.949" offset="14772203">Therefore, these things that -- to the Government, that this case is as different from the Watkins case, as black is different from white.</text>

            <text syncTime="3688.231" offset="14857362">From the very first, Mr. Barenblatt said that he had objections to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.598" offset="14890799">He had grounds stated in the paper that he had and that also they would not take them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3707.770" offset="14935521">Finally, he said, "I've been trying to answer not on the Fifth Amendment, but on -- but on the grounds stated in my objection that's presented to the members of this committee which you have not allowed me to read.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.485" offset="14986303">And if that showed, one of the grounds of this objection was that if the purpose disclosed is not a legitimate ones, he may not be compelled to answer.</text>

            <text syncTime="3918.347" offset="15777813">Now, the -- the Government does not read Watkins as having declared the authorizing resolution of the House Un-American Activities Committee as being totally invalid to support the compulsory use of process in -- in any kind of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3933.186" offset="15837163">I think that the -- if the Court had -- if that were the holding of the Watkins, we would all be wondering what we're doing here today, because Barenblatt's conviction could not stand up anymore than Watkins, if that was the holding of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3946.973" offset="15892334">And furthermore, as the court below pointed out, surely this Court, if it was making such a far-reaching decision as that, would've said so in so many words, because that would have nullified the charter of the House Un-American Activities Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3961.411" offset="15950012">It couldn't hold anymore hearings such a -- a far-reaching and important decision as that certainly would be made clear and in plain terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3970.083" offset="15984703">The actual holding of the case is what I suggested a few moments ago and we read the Watkins language directed to vagueness and to the vagueness and imprecision of the -- of the charter as being relevant to the question of what means Watkins had of ascertaining the subject of inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3993.787" offset="16079579">That -- the Court points out in its -- in its opinion that the subject of inquiry can be garnered from several sources.</text>

            <text syncTime="4024.473" offset="16202250">If I can assume that the question of the Un-American Activities Committee's charter, the validity of it is still open, I should like to point out to the Court that accepting the language of the Watkins opinion that the language of the resolution is vague and imprecise nevertheless, that language does not come before the Court in its bare terms alone, but with the gloss of a lengthy legislative history which shows clearly that the purpose of the House in setting up this committee was to investigate two -- two things, The German-American Bund back in the 1930s and the communism.</text>
            <text syncTime="4078.145" offset="16416977">And for that reason, even though looking at the bare language of the resolution alone, it must be admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4088.524" offset="16458459">Under Watkins, we have been taught by Watkins that it is vague and imprecise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4093.176" offset="16477059">I want to emphasize that -- that the bare language alone is not before the Court, but it has this clause of this legislative history.</text>

            <text syncTime="4121.620" offset="16590848">But the difference between this case and the Rumely case is that in Rumely, there was no way of knowing that the House intended its committee to go into the particular phase of lobbying activities, which that case involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="5549.660" offset="22302992">It must meet the problem with a keen realization that it is Congress' and not this Court's responsibility to find the legislative means for -- for dealing with this danger and that in finding such legislative tools, it must not be encased in a straightjacket.</text>
            <text syncTime="5567.132" offset="22372895">It would be easy, this Court said, in the (Inaudible) case, speaking for Mr. Justice Jackson, here he was speaking for the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="5724.978" offset="23004327">And now under the National Defense Education Act of 1938 passed two months ago, there as a -- a broad program of aid to education generally, the Government submits that it's too late in the day to suggest that Congress has no legitimate interest with the problem of Communists in the educational world.</text>
            <text syncTime="5748.215" offset="23097219">The statistics reviewed in our brief show that for the -- the veterans educational assistance program alone, since it's beginning through the academic year 1954 to 1955, a total of over $17 billion were appropriated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5765.616" offset="23166809">Truly, it seems to the Government, Congress has the most lively interest in communism in education.</text>

            <text syncTime="6650.551" offset="26706610">But, and this is the point I want to emphasize, so far as the repressive effect on First Amendment liberty is concerned, the asking of that question by the City of Los Angeles is really no different from the asking of that question in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6674.960" offset="26804203">In other words, the public interest was different in that case from the public interest in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6683.400" offset="26837953">I'm not saying it was any stronger, but the effect of the asking of the question on the First Amendment liberty was no different.</text>
            <text syncTime="6693.260" offset="26877450">And in Adler against the Board of Education of the City of New York, this Court held that it was not a violation of the Fourth -- of the First Amendment as incorporated in the Fourteenth, for the City of New York to enact the Feinberg Law providing for the promulgation of a list of organizations membership in which would constitute prima facie evidence of disqualification from public school employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6717.216" offset="26973268">And this Court said in the course of that opinion, in the employment of officials and teachers of the school system, a State may very properly inquire into the company they keep.</text>
            <text syncTime="6728.479" offset="27018303">And we know of no rule, constitutional or otherwise, that prevents the State when determining the fitness and loyalty of such persons from considering the organizations and persons with whom they associate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6743.325" offset="27077653">And only last term in the Beilan and the Lerner cases, this Court held in the Beilan case that it was not a violation of the First Amendment as incorporated in the Fourteenth for the Board of Public Education of Philadelphia to discharge a teacher from his position in the public schools of that city for refusing to answer a question of whether or not he had ever been an officer of the Communist political association.</text>
            <text syncTime="6771.278" offset="27189457">And in the Lerner case, similarly this Court held that it was not a violation of the First Amendment as incorporated in the Fourteenth, for the New York City Transit Authority to discharge a subway conductor from his position in a city subway system for refusing to answer the question of whether or not he was then a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="6792.395" offset="27273989">This Court pointed out in Garner, Mr. Justice Harlan said in the course of the -- of the Court's opinion, that a government employee can be required under pain of dismissal, to respond to inquiry proving into matters relevant to his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6806.985" offset="27332295">And that present membership in the Communist Party is such a matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="6811.936" offset="27352148">I submit to the Court that in all of these cases I've been referring to the repressive effect upon First Amendment liberties was just as great in those cases as -- as in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6824.825" offset="27403661">And that that those cases were correctly decided, Barenblatt cannot be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6829.867" offset="27423828">And in the Douds case, which although in older case, in some ways went further than any of us -- those -- those more recent cases, this Court held that there was not a violation of the First Amendment for Congress to require as a condition of any labor union utilizing the facilities of the National Labor of Relations Board to file affidavits by all the officers of the union and of any international union with which it was affiliated stating what?</text>
            <text syncTime="6863.714" offset="27559246">Not -- whether or not, they were members of the Communist Party, not that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6869.578" offset="27582757">But that they were not members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="6874.552" offset="27602610">And the Government's opinion that -- the Douds decision goes much further than the Government asks this Court to go in this case and that if Douds was correctly decided, a fortiori this case must be decided by affirmance.</text>
            <text syncTime="6891.409" offset="27670006">And, of course, the lower court decisions I refer you to the Barsky, Josephson and long line of lower court decisions which have held that there is no violation of First Amendment rights in asking this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6905.426" offset="27726117">As Mr. -- as Judge Prettyman said in the Barsky case, if Congress has the power to inquire into the subjects of communism and the Communist Party, it has power to identify the individuals who believe in communism and those who belong to the Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="6919.347" offset="27781810">The nature and scope of the program and activities that can in large measure upon the character and number of their adherence, personnel is part of the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="6931.790" offset="27831547">And finally, in conclusion, and to please the Court, I would remind the Court with deference and respect that the issue in this case is not the wisdom of this act of this committee, but the power.</text>
            <text syncTime="6944.300" offset="27881597">And that if this Court, after consideration of all of the considerations advanced in -- by argument in the Government's brief, comes to the conclusion that this committee and the Congress did have the power to exact answers to this question, then no -- no conviction however, firmly held as to the unwisdom of this action should deter it from upholding this conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="6968.490" offset="27978355">Thank you.</text>
