            <text syncTime="473.409" offset="1996988">A desire, if I may, at the outset, set forth some of the pertinent facts, not the detailed facts, but some of the pertinent facts which may be involved in the legal discussions which I expect to make shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.275" offset="2064488">First, I'd like to bring to the Honors' attention that this vessel was in the waters, at a dock, in the State of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.227" offset="2112240">That aboard this vessel, when it's undisputed, at least, the facts supported, was the captain and four or five deck men, there was a full compliment of the engine crew and there, those men were doing maintenance work at the same time that this maintenance or overhauling work was being done by the shipyard men, during the entire time.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.986" offset="2243271">I'd like to bring also to, Your Honors' attention that the specification of repairs which is set forth on page 2 of my brief, sets forth that the crew, meaning the ship's crew, was to remove and replace the eight cylinder heads from -- for the port and start with generators.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.544" offset="2329579">That the very generators which were to be cleaned by this plaintiff, this Halecki, the very generator was removed and replaced by the ship's crew and then it provided in that specifications which spray clean with carbon tetrachloride.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.048" offset="2411604">In other words, the work to be done by this Halecki, the shore-side electrician, was to spray clean with carbon tetrachloride, so set forth in the specification repairs of this defendant, the vessel, and so ordered and directed by this defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.467" offset="2493210">And it was known that it was a dangerous substance in confined spaces and it was for use in the engine room.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.993" offset="2527378">And not only was it known, but the chief engineer in consultation with the foreman of the deceased, agreed to have the work done on a day when the members of the crew won't be present.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.366" offset="2572831">And that was just suddenly when this occurrence occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.818" offset="2586624">And they cleared the vessel of the members of the crew from doing all the work and they just had a watchman, a ship's watchman aboard, and they started to do this work.</text>

            <text syncTime="900.291" offset="3704560">The fact the trial judge submitted to the jury on the two points, one is negligence; one is unseaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.990" offset="3727339">And I'd like to bring to Your Honors' attention, which has not been brought out yet, that there was two cause of action here.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.607" offset="3749804">The first cause of action was the survival action, namely, for the rights of the deceased up to the time of his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.565" offset="3785644">And then in that action the jury bought in $2500.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.751" offset="3798392">And the second cause of action is the death action.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.387" offset="3808946">The right of the representatives, the widow and children in this case or the death of the deceased and that action the jury board in $62,500 and that's the verdicts in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.416" offset="3857011">And I submit to Your Honor that the evidence which is submitted on the negligence and the -- was sustained by a jury and that it be unnecessary for me to go into the question on negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.210" offset="3916257">In fact the dissenting opinion by Judge Lumbard, also agreed that the question of negligence was one probably submitted to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.313" offset="3952619">Now, I submit to Your Honor, that the first question to be determined and that I'd like to argue before Your Honors, is, was the deceased in his lifetime entitles to the warranty of seaworthiness on this vessel?</text>
            <text syncTime="974.254" offset="4000371">That's the first question -- in his lifetime.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.084" offset="4011760">And I submit to Your Honor, that this man was a shore-side electrician.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.404" offset="4041017">And that, no electrician is certainly considered as members of the ship's crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.913" offset="4063065">And that under the Sieracki case, mean even though the work was puzzled out to other people, that the puzzling out of this work for a shore-side electrician does not deprive him of the warranty of seaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.040" offset="4119489">So that -- and two reasons, first this electrician which I don't think it needs any extensive argument to indicate electricians are members of the ship's crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.907" offset="4155016">And secondly, the work that he was doing was maintenance work -- cleaning -- so what he was doing was cleaning these generators in the engine room.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.765" offset="4190438">And certainly cleaning, the maintenance work is essentially ship's work, and I submit to Your Honor that it's work not only traditionally, but actually performed by seamen up to present time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1254.716" offset="5122278">"If the warranty of seaworthiness applies to landsmen aboard a vessel, performing work historically performed by seamen, it should certainly be applied to landsmen aboard performing work currently performed by seamen and I submit to our case is analogous that he's a plumber -- plumber fixing a pipe and he was his electrician not repairing, just -- just cleaning a mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.619" offset="5217886">And Judge Learned Hand has indicated in his decision in the court below and I think he can say it in much better language than I can, that he sees no distinction between the work being done by Halecki and the work being done by Hawn, in the Hawn Pope &amp; Talbot case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.538" offset="5289566">And he thinks that the test is whether the work is of trying to traditionally the crew is in the (Inaudible) and as to that, it makes no difference that the means employed have changed with time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.666" offset="5334079">And he therefore, felt that since the deceased would clean the ship, he was within the doctrine of Pope &amp; Talbot and Hawn, and he entitled to seaworthy vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.921" offset="5375039">Now, our case or my counsel has not gone into, although he didn't agree -- gone at this very hill and a few other cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1335.987" offset="5447346">And in that case, in those cases, the crew was discharged.</text>

            <text syncTime="1364.071" offset="5559672">Namely, here we have a situation where under the Hawn case, Pope &amp; Talbot against Hawn, if the person was alive and Halecki was alive, it's undisputed under that case, a decision by Justice Black, that he would have two rights of recovering, namely one, for negligence and two, for unseaworthiness, and I might add in there that contributory negligence would not be a bar, but the admiralty rule of comparative negligence would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.101" offset="5687777">But here we have not a -- personally the case, but a death case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.620" offset="5709824">And in order to recover under the maritime law, which is silent as to recovery for death, the wrongful death and the Court was required to adopt the Wrongful Death Act of the State of New Jersey, where this acts occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.070" offset="5791640">And in adopting it, it then gave this cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.491" offset="5817344">And I submit to Your Honor that in looking at the New Jersey Act, which has been adopted under the maritime law so as to give it force and effect, we look at New Jersey Act, I submit to Your Honor that the Act has a referral clause in it.</text>
