            <text syncTime="69.687" offset="382098">It is, in short, a preemption case.</text>

            <text syncTime="759.281" offset="3140524">Prior to that, Mr. Oliver was an independent contractor in his relationship to the certificated carrier, that this particular provision of the contract, Article 32, was not protected by Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.528" offset="3209488">That Article 32 had violated the Ohio Antitrust Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="811.875" offset="3350862">Upon appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, it was held that there was no debatable constitutional question we're here now.</text>

            <text syncTime="947.715" offset="3894209">And this Court that far back said that the realities of industrial such strike require that the Court take cognizance of the problem of competition for wages that is created with the owner-operator method of distribution as distinguished from an employee-driver distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.093" offset="3975711">Similarly, when the American Trucking Association case was before this Court, this Court took judicial knowledge and accepted I should say the findings of the Interstate Commerce Commission and its regulation known as MC-43.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.457" offset="4033181">That the owner-operator created a very serious safety problem in this industry and this Court affirmed the right of the Interstate Commerce Commission to meet that problem by promulgating regulations with respect to what shall be the contents of those leases and what shall be the method of compensation under those leases and what shall be the requirements for examination and inspection in interchange of equipment if those owner-operators or any person leasing vehicles were to lease them to a certificated carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.483" offset="4181347">Article 32 generally ensures the employee status of the owner-driver and I will break it down a little bit more in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.465" offset="4217187">But just to get a general picture, it assures the payment of union wages and the enjoyment of union conditions, the protection of seniority, it requires payment of social security upon these owner-drivers, workmen's compensation, unemployment compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.087" offset="4279672">They must get their health and welfare benefits, their pension benefits, their vacations, their seniority just as any other driver under the particular provision which is now before the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1095.040" offset="4483532">Whether release rates provided for in this agreement there are reasonable relationship to the protection of wages, whether or not the subcontracting clause, there is a reasonable relationship to the purposes for which Labor Unions are formed that we can ignore the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.272" offset="4544449">And we can assert the illegality of this particular contract clause because for suits that violates the Antitrust Act of the State of Ohio regardless of whether it maybe legal or illegal in any other state or under the National Labor Relations Act.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1891.410" offset="7669008">What was the specific condition which they were seeking to meet?</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.404" offset="7681024">All of that is set forth in our brief and I won't burden the Court with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.298" offset="7696593">I want to get to Section 12 which is the key provision and which we feel the Ohio Courts were so obsessed with that they lost complete cite of the general picture and perhaps this is our fault and not the Ohio Court's fault, perhaps we didn't present it properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.455" offset="7765243">But Section 12 of this agreement -- of Article 32 sets forth minimum lease rates for a certain described and defined types of equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.204" offset="7828146">I want to emphasize that this has no application to any equipment which is not driven by the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.569" offset="7857612">When Revel Oliver leases six pieces of equipment to a carrier, he can lease it for any rate he wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.105" offset="7883839">The only way this contract infringes upon that is we say that the driver of that equipment must be an employee and receive the benefits of this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.291" offset="7916544">But he is free to negotiate any kind of a lease rate he wants for the use of his equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.018" offset="7943398">But when he drives his own equipment, this minimum lease rate applies just as it applies to the more typical owner-operator who owns only one piece of equipment and comes to the service of the carrier who has a contract with us and starts to drive that piece of equipment in the service of that carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.366" offset="8016854">And I -- and I think the reason is so simple perhaps that's why we -- we haven't persuaded the Ohio Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.327" offset="8052694">And let me give you -- we have the exact example in the brief with the exact rates which are set forth in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.627" offset="8077876">But in the interest of simplicity, let me give you a simple example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.332" offset="8096684">In this kind of operation generally, the rate of pay is per mile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.781" offset="8118523">Over the road long distance drivers and they get paid per mile as to the total number of miles which they may have driven during the course rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.477" offset="8149243">Now let's assume that this particular driver's rate is 10 cents a mile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.717" offset="8174216">Now he has leased his equipment to the carrier, and understand this again, it is only when he is driving his own equipment that this particular Article 5 Section applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.679" offset="8222072">Now, he has leased his equipment to the carrier, too and he has leased this equipment to the carrier for 5 cents per mile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.441" offset="8253106">Now he's getting a total of 15 cents a mile for every mile he is driving in the service of carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.360" offset="8276825">But lo and behold after several weeks he finds out that it is costing him 8 cents a mile to operate his equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.524" offset="8313501">In other words, he is taking a beating in his equipment pocket for 3 cents a mile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.259" offset="8328443">Where does it come from?</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.935" offset="8339101">Now, the 10 cents a mile driver's rate is no longer a 10 cents a mile driver's rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.860" offset="8358849">It's a 7 cents a mile driver's rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.446" offset="8369194">Because he has had to take that 3 cents subtracted from his driver's rate and put into his equipment pocket so that he comes out on the equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.356" offset="8408795">This kind of a thing is what this contract was designed to prevent and only that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2238.144" offset="9055901">But have merely established a minimum lease rate to assure the payment of wages and incidentally owner-operators can go out and negotiate anything about the minimum they pleased.</text>

            <text syncTime="2251.065" offset="9107623">The record shows that this minimum lease rate is set so low that as a matter of practical effect, most carriers are paying more than the minimum lease rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.313" offset="9152658">And the one carrier who testified is one of the largest carriers in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.865" offset="9170840">He said that he could not operate his equipment for what we establish as a minimum lease rate in order to protect wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.611" offset="9201768">In other words, we may not actually be giving those drivers all of the protection that we try to give them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.503" offset="9225383">We may have set a lower rate than is required by the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.558" offset="9245654">But in setting that rate and the record shows this, intensive studies were made of the various factors which entered into determining how much it does cost to operate trucks of various sizes over their normal life span.</text>

            <text syncTime="2591.694" offset="10470170">Because if you multiply Revel Oliver by many hundreds or thousands in this area then we have of course lost the protection of the contract because each one of those fellows driving his own equipment, taking a beating on the equipment then, has got to take a beating on the wage end and he's undercutting our wages and he does that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2660.785" offset="10746546">And this Court has said in this seniority case involving the Ford Motor Company that the union has a wide discretion in dealing with both exceptional and typical employment conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.669" offset="10786043">And this is one of the unusual employment conditions which -- at least it's an -- it's unusual in industry generally.</text>
