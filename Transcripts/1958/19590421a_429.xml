            <text syncTime="24.434" offset="201122">Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.249" offset="224319">I'm indebted to this Court for the privilege of coming here to present a problem which has played the merchant marine industry for many years with the hope that the expression by this Court may help us meet some of the problems which meet -- meets our -- our everyday lives not only those representing the seamen but also representing the shipowners and the U.S. Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.982" offset="347303">Mindfully aware of the fact that this problem has been presented to this Court some 10 years ago in the Johansen and the Mendel cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.461" offset="397249">But at that time, it seems that a reading of the cases and the opinions from the District Courts up including this Honorable nor these body's reports on the various items that were considered that the problem was considered as separate, unilateral matters instead of taking the entire field, entire material, in determining where are we heading and are we adding confusion to turmoil?</text>
            <text syncTime="111.506" offset="549386">We must consider the problem from its very beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.865" offset="578853">The United States Government when it first started to operate vessels did so solely for the purpose of creating a -- an auxiliary to its defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.058" offset="635591">But it went beyond that and went into business, the same as the man who was selling dresses on the corner store.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.610" offset="673834">We are now concerned with the question of whether the Government having gone into the business of merchandizing or manufacturing shall receive special privileges over and beyond that accorded to the man next door.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.921" offset="767039">If the Government opens the store on one corner, does the Government get special privilege over and beyond that of the man who is opening the same identical store on the adjourning corner?</text>
            <text syncTime="179.180" offset="820120">And if this Court says yes, that's the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.313" offset="832658">And if this Court says no, that also was the end of it but at least we are entitled to know how this Court feels about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.129" offset="863901">The Clarification Acts of Congress in dealing with these problems have seemed to add confusion rather than help us by --</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="200.881" offset="906846">You don't want us to take over their job, do you?</text>

          <turn speaker="jacob_rassner" startTime="202.977" stopTime="577.131">
            <label>Mr. Jacob Rassner</label>
            <text syncTime="202.977" offset="915310">I certainly wish we could, the answer to Your Honor's question is, yes, (Inaudible) which has mean nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.893" offset="934954">But I'm answering, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, your question directly, I wish you could.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.512" offset="957419">At least, we get some -- some idea of what is meant by the words of the English language as used to be so-called.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.303" offset="992632">And I use the expression so-called advisedly Clarification Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.353" offset="1012799">Now, where do we start?</text>
            <text syncTime="229.321" offset="1020635">With the United States Government first went into the business of the merchant marine back in 1916 with the Shipping Act pursuant to the provisions of which the Emergency Fleet Corporation was created then we had all the troubles that this Court was fully aware of where our vessels were seized and then we have the flag case where this Court held that an action in rem would lie against the vessels although the Government had not waived sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.002" offset="1163368">Then we had the Public Vessels Act, the suits in Admiralty Act followed by the Public Vessels Act which took away the right to libel the vessels in rem but did create a new light, that is an action in personam against the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.621" offset="1233899">We went from there to various corporations, companies, and entities which were formed like the mechanical division of the Panama Canal.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.591" offset="1273710">Then we have the Inland Waterways Corporation, the War Shipping Administration, all makeshift means and methods of meeting sudden emergencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.819" offset="1314670">And all of these were created for a temporary time to meet an immediate need but never was it intended that the U.S. Government should go into the business permanently of being a merchant shipper.As these different entities were formed and then changed from one to the other, the mechanical division of the Panama Canal was taken over by the Panama Canal Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.552" offset="1417592">The Inland Waterways Corporation was taken over by the Department of Commerce in 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.760" offset="1442461">The War Shipping Administration had -- was ended and its functions were taken over by the Maritime Commission for liquidation and the Department of Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.379" offset="1488854">And as -- they were changes from time to time, we have played their troubles.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.239" offset="1508289">Now, we didn't know -- we just don't know where to go that's why we're here.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.889" offset="1518947">We want to know what -- what are we to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="356.906" offset="1530964">Now, if a seamen as the U.S. Code States any man working on a ship of the Government is a seaman except an apprentice, if a seaman is to be judged by the scale that his work shall determine his rights then we're entitled to bring our actions against the U.S. Government regardless under what name or in whose name the shipper is operating.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.417" offset="1649037">If the right sought to be judged by the title then before I can tell my perspective client, you'll have a cause of action, I have to come down to Washington and endeavor the impossible, find out what kind of cargo was carried on the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.568" offset="1713612">Now to me that seems a little ridiculous that the right a seamen should depend upon what is the number five hold and who knows what was there after that ship lands as a practical matter, nobody.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.913" offset="1763035">You just can't find out what was carried in the number four and number five hold and what was that cargo?</text>
            <text syncTime="422.321" offset="1792606">And if that is to determine the right of the man to a cause of action then I for one certainly don't see the justice of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.918" offset="1831058">This Court has expressed itself time and the gain that we are dealing with a practical proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.499" offset="1857390">Congress has stated time and again that it wants seamen to be considered, as words of the Court, that they are entitled to have any doubtful issues resolved in their favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.303" offset="1932622">They have further expressed in every Act, that nothing contained in this Act shall affect their rights, of officers, of members, of the crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.495" offset="1973373">Now, we had some question come up on whether or not the 1949 Amendments of the Federal Employees Compensation Act changed the rights of seamen, of course not.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.619" offset="2041814">If they had any rights before they had them after and if they didn't, they don't have it after.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.760" offset="2066369">But that isn't the basis of my being here.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.853" offset="2078804">It seems to me that insofar as the -- when the Inland Waterways Corporation was formed, nothing was said about anybody working for the Inland Waterways Corporation or for a subcontractor or agent of the Corporation having any rights under the Federal Employees Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.926" offset="2179114">And the 1949 Amendment was -- one of the purposes was to include employees of the Inland Waterways Corporation within the benefits of that Act, but they said not seamen, not members of the crew, indicating that legislature -- with every a statute says that.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.792" offset="2254555">Every time Congress spoke it said, “But not seamen, not members of the crew.”</text>
            <text syncTime="543.652" offset="2277961">So when -- when we have the Public Vessels Acts enacted that also gave us some confusion and some concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.535" offset="2309517">Now, this Court and the American Stevedore against Porella, stricken that problem out and said, “Well, it doesn't matter that the Act does not specifically say that a seaman may -- may or may not sue.”</text>
            <text syncTime="566.445" offset="2369181">Nothing was said in the Public Vessels Act and that time Mr. Justice Frankfurter, you didn't seem to agree with our argument but since then I thought your expressions indicate that we're dealing with the practical problem.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="577.131" stopTime="579.901">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="577.131" offset="2411917">I didn't (Inaudible), I mean, the results, did it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jacob_rassner" startTime="579.901" stopTime="692.386">
            <label>Mr. Jacob Rassner</label>
            <text syncTime="579.901" offset="2422993">Well, you -- you have -- you have more than pleased that man interested in seamen's right since then by telling us point blank, we're entitled to the practical proposition that confront us, not theoretical.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.195" offset="2484120">We are not concern in whose name the title is.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.235" offset="2496345">We are concerned in what is the man doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.497" offset="2513377">Is he working as a seaman, therefore, shall he be governed by one standard and his brother be governed by another standard?</text>
            <text syncTime="612.392" offset="2552978">Now, when the Clarification Act was up for consideration by the 77th Congress and the General Counsel to the War Shipping Administration was asked for his opinion, he said if I can remember correctly, I think Mr. Colby has quoted it on page 27 of his brief, “Seamen constantly interchange from time charted vessels to deported and owned vessels where the personnel become employees of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.875" offset="2738866">The rights of seamen may does change from voyage to voyage dependent upon the particular status of the vessel at the time they sail.”</text>
            <text syncTime="676.553" offset="2809605">He mentioned the fact that this created many administrative problems and recommended that by reason of the interchanged ability of seamen and that is his expression this creates many administrative problems.</text>

            <text syncTime="1067.369" offset="4372877">In other words, in 1916, Congress never considered this problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="1076.296" offset="4408508">The government did not have ships that was not in business as a merchant marine operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.971" offset="4439228">So that to go back to a time beyond when this country was operating ships as a merchant marine business and applied the 1916 law to conditions which became present later, I think is carrying it a little too far and I believe that this Court in considering the question should be -- should construe these enabling acts and these remedial acts in a liberal manner the same it was done in the Canadian Aviation case and in the American Stevedore against Porella.</text>

            <text syncTime="1278.406" offset="5216946">It was before Congress at the time of the Clarification Act of 1943 as I recall Mr. Rassner and I both had a small part in that affair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.983" offset="5259264">It was mooted again at the time of the Compensation Amendments of 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.758" offset="5290402">And this particular provision of 1949 that saves the man's rights to claim compensation after they have lost their right to suit, if the Court decides against them, was inserted because of a floor amendment in the Senate after the bill had passed the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.099" offset="5399803">The situation there was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.206" offset="5412237">The Compensation Act was being revised and somewhat liberalized and representatives of certain of the seamen's groups came and wanted to have themselves excluded because Congress was of course unwilling to give them both compensation and also to give them the right to suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.395" offset="5508995">So some of the seamen wanted to be excluded from the coverage of the Compensation Act and have just the rights to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.509" offset="5549432">That is what had been done at the occasion of the Clarification Act in 1943 with respect to the War Shipping Administration seamen during the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.748" offset="5590392">Your Honors we'll recall that during the wartime operations, we had over 200 thousand seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.822" offset="5614634">We took over that whole -- of the merchant marine and as Mr. Rassner says and as it shows in the brief, everybody said these fellows were going interchangeably.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.212" offset="5656221">Now, that has nothing to do of course with this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.385" offset="5668864">That had been disposed off by the Clarification Act of 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.704" offset="5690180">These men working on commercial type vessels of the United States had been under that regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.456" offset="5717243">They are still under that regime although they are only a few thousand of them now because the Maritime Administration as successor to the War Shipping Administration has very little.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.865" offset="5758830">Now, those people had been taken care of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.415" offset="5769070">They had been assimilated to private seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.274" offset="5780459">They had been excluded by Congress from the benefits of the Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.344" offset="5800730">When the 1949 Compensation Amendments came forward, the same controversy broke out, what is to be the seamen's right?</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.345" offset="5840750">Now, just as in 1943, the Government seamen other than those on these commercial operations remained under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.979" offset="5895293">So, in 1949, Congress took the position that they would not without hearings take away the compensation right of the large numbers of regular government seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.940" offset="5967182">And so we had this provision writtedn into the Act to take care of the possibility that the regular government seamen --</text>

            <text syncTime="1615.477" offset="6565282">I think that many of these government seamen are subject to various veterans' preference and appeal rights of that sort, but this is a terribly difficult question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.151" offset="6608018">This is a matter which makes Mr. Rassner's problem about whether the seamen who has a clear right to compensation might also be able to sue for negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.659" offset="6650023">It pale's in -- in significance along side of these questions of Civil Service Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.722" offset="6670294">But these men are of course in the larger sense, Civil Service employees, an expression which means merely that they are civilian employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.371" offset="6716897">They are not in the military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.214" offset="6724211">They are in the civil end of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.079" offset="6739675">Now as I say, this is the big group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.223" offset="6752214">Then there's a large group of those who serve on the army tugs and army barges at the ports of embarkation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.599" offset="6797772">Now, these seamen are engaged in the handling of cargo for the military departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.613" offset="6821804">They take it from the railhead and they take it over to the army base and they take it over to a vessel which may be government or maybe private and it goes ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.490" offset="6857331">Now, as Mr. Rassner says, if there's cargo that consist of defendant's property -- a dependents' property aboard one of those barges being moved by a tugboat then the contention is made at any rate that -- that vessel is subject to the suits in Admiralty Act and not a subject to the Public Vessels Act because the cargo aboard is not exclusively governmental cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.092" offset="6979688">There is property of dependents and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.986" offset="6995362">These are -- are very difficult concepts as my Brother says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.375" offset="7012916">Now, if the question of jurisdiction is to be made to depend on what the cargo is aboard, you have no end of difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.488" offset="7065370">In many instances you don't know a year or two later when a man tries to bring a suit, you wouldn't know what the cargo was aboard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.179" offset="7096090">On large military types, the cargo manifest is probably confidential.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.515" offset="7121481">Commonly, we admit that all of these things are employed as merchant vessels because we don't know that it makes any difference and you can't say that it isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.875" offset="7154918">But these are the controversies here that Mr. Rassner is talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.375" offset="7172890">And that is why we believe that the correct reading of this Court's opinion in Johansen was that if the vessel was a publically operated vessel, a public vessel in that sense so that the seamen were -- of the class who are entitled to Federal Employees' Compensation then it was their exclusive remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.718" offset="7274245">That is consistent what -- with what this Court held in the Feres case with respect to military benefits and what has been done about compensation for the police by the District of Columbia Court, a certiorari denied in Louis and what has been done for post-exchange employees of the Government in the Audrey case, which I believe is again certiorari denied from the District of Columbia.</text>

            <text syncTime="1874.728" offset="7602239">We had a delightful time with Mr. Freedman who was a counsel for Mendel in the Johansen and Mendel cases over a -- army engineer corps barge dredging the Delaware River up in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.712" offset="7666186">He contended that of course dredging was a private operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.653" offset="7685935">So therefore, the army engineer's dredge which was dredging the river was engaged in a commercial function.</text>

            <text syncTime="1911.320" offset="7748629">And he introduced testimony to show that on the same job, the army engineers had to contract barges hired from private contractors and they had one of their own with the Civil Service crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.284" offset="7796485">And he said they are all the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="1926.579" offset="7809651">They seem to think that the question again was if it was publically operated probably it was a public vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.209" offset="7844237">We refer in our brief to the cases in this Court on this doctrine that whatever is done for the public is a public vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.634" offset="7885928">That is at the bottom of page 14 here, the Berizzi Brothers against the Pesaro and Navemar and Ex parte Peru merely holding in line with I guess its graves ex rel -- well, Graves against the State of New York that when the public does something that it's a public operation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2032.215" offset="8232208">This is of course rather amusing to me because the Bureau of Employees' Compensation didn't want the case appealed because they said the value of the man's compensation rights are around $175,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.926" offset="8291035">So they were happy that he should get $85,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.239" offset="8304306">The significance of the thing again is that of course the figure that appears in the law reports was the minimum that he was entitled to before he made his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.003" offset="8355401">And perhaps I should at this point explain that the Federal Employees' Compensation Act is not the same kind of a small payment act that the Longshoremen's Act is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.366" offset="8400854">The Federal Employees' Compensation Act has a maximum yearly payment of $7200 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.400" offset="8440978">In other words, that's as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.245" offset="8448397">If command needs an attendant, he may be awarded $75 a month for that purpose and Mr. Cullen by the way could have had such an award made to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.425" offset="8489044">Then, there is the maximum compensation generally which is $6300 a year or $525 a month or a $125 a week if you like to figure your four and a third weeks down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.366" offset="8548812">Now, this is a very different thing than the prices under the Longshoremen's Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.242" offset="8572322">And as Mr. Rassner has pointed out, seamen are high priced men but that also works that they are high priced men from the standpoint of compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.870" offset="8614849">Your Honors must understand that of the 25 attorneys on the Admiralty Staff of the Government, 20 approximately do not make as much money as a -- as the average seaman makes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.352" offset="8680782">So consequently, we have the situation of seaman who make of course nine to $12,000 a year and they are in the upper brackets on this compensation business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.451" offset="8721220">Now, my Brother has said in his brief that it's a dreadful thing that the laws of a --- of a arm is valued at only 312 weeks compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.076" offset="8775659">But 312 weeks compensation of the $125 a week as I recall is $39,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.179" offset="8808051">And remember, he hasn't had to pay any attorney at a rate of 25% to 55% to get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.709" offset="8834173">So, we feel that $39,000 for that arm corresponds almost to $75,000 recovered under the Jones Act in a private case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.358" offset="8884851">So, this is not a discrimination unfavorable to the seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.983" offset="8907316">It is a discrimination by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.406" offset="8917034">Congress and its wisdom has said certain seamen aren't to be under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.445" offset="8945142">Certain other seamen to wit the War Shipping Administration Seamen, the Maritime Commission Seamen are excluded from the Compensation Act and are given the same rights as private seamen to sue the Government under the Jones Act for unseaworthiness for maintenance and cure.</text>

            <text syncTime="2247.001" offset="9091427">That arises in Patterson because Patterson -- Doody, the man who was killed in the Patterson case, Doody was an employee of the mechanical division of the Panama Canal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.940" offset="9147120">In other words, he was a shipyard man from the -- a ship repairman from the Panama Canal Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.383" offset="9172929">And he came aboard a War Shipping Administration vessel back 1945 and was killed in the course of his duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.863" offset="9206784">He was of course in some sense a shore side employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.700" offset="9222144">But under Section 713 of Title 46 of the United States Code, everybody who works aboard a vessel is a seaman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.626" offset="9257880">So, if compensation had not been missed to duties exclusive remedy, he would have been able to sue the Government under the Jones Act just like any other seamen for negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.106" offset="9311796">That of course is what this Court held in the Imbrovek and Haverty and Uravic against Jarka, I believe were the three cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.159" offset="9359966">So consequently, the Patterson case presented the question of whether it made any difference that Doody, when injured on the War Shipping Administration vessel in 1945 was an employee of the Panama Canal as opposed to an employee of the War Shipping Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.567" offset="9441677">And of course the answer is yes, as the War Shipping Administration employee would have been excluded from compensation and would have of course had a right to suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.962" offset="9475218">Being an employee of the Panama Canal Company, he was entitled the compensation and was not entitled to sue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2358.636" offset="9537912">I don't think there's the slightest bit of difficulty Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.731" offset="9554317">I -- I had the greatest trouble in thinking that these fellows and the -- the regular government seamen have any such difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.171" offset="9596008">A man who goes to work and he's hired through the army base by a bunch of fellows who wear those uniforms you know, he knows pretty well that he is working for the United States and he doesn't confuse an army tug or an army barge with a private tug or a private barge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.269" offset="9672495">And a man who works on a ferryboat run by the Immigration Service of the Department of Justice, I don't think that he probably is in much doubt either.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.880" offset="9710843">And when you come to the 500 seamen of the Inland Waterways Corporation, I think they were perhaps the least because that corporation carefully posted up aboard all of its vessels scheduled about the Federal Employees' Compensation Act how the employees were under that and that you're an employee of the United States and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.871" offset="9790882">That is perhaps one of the reasons why we had only five or six cases involving the Inland Waterways seamen even though there were 500 a year of them from 1916 or whenever it was that IWC was organized down to its sale of its vessels in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.266" offset="9868413">So I -- I think that's greatly exaggerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.726" offset="9882311">There maybe a few seamen who don't know who they're working for.</text>

            <text syncTime="2467.022" offset="9971440">The idea that a man doesn't know he is working for the Government is of course quite inconceivable to me because the Government won't let you forget it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.163" offset="10000071">And this is just as true -- [Laughter] -- this is just as true -- this is just as true if you're a seaman as if you're an attorney.</text>

            <text syncTime="2484.629" offset="10041866">Now, Mr. Rassner is perfectly correct about the War Shipping Administration of people back there in 1943 when we passed the Clarification Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2500.426" offset="10105083">One the reasons that passed the Clarification Act and excluded the man from compensation was they thought it was cheaper to put them under the Jones Act negligence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2727.962" offset="11015189">Now, Mr. Rassner has talked about this test of knowing what the man's employment is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.389" offset="11044968">Seamen are not the only group that present that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.519" offset="11057403">We have the same problem with respect to the railroad workers which are probably a larger group.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.627" offset="11081853">We have 1450 men working for the Alaska Railroad and approximately 500 men working for the Panama Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.439" offset="11117171">Now, they're under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.008" offset="11131382">There has never been any doubt on the part of any of the lower courts that these people may not sue under the Federal Employers' Liability Act and the Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.708" offset="11190209">Three or four of them sue every year but the District Courts usually have dismissed them without any opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.112" offset="11215809">But that's exactly the same kind of thing if you're going to try to make the test what the man does as opposed to the fact that he is employed by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.250" offset="11256351">On the same principle, I would think that maybe some distinctions could be drawn with respect to doctors who work for the government and lawyers who work for the Government that might not be good but they could be drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.086" offset="11319672">I'm sorry not to have presented a more coherent argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.422" offset="11333047">I had endeavored to organize one but perhaps by answering the questions as they came along I have been as helpful.</text>
