            <text syncTime="13.612" offset="157863">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.773" offset="174477">The petitioners in this case were indicted with two others on the charge of conspiracy to destroy government communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.458" offset="221184">All four of them were convicted and all four of them were sentenced to terms in the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.123" offset="251904">The conviction was taken up to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.243" offset="272384">Two of the defendants -- their case was reversed and remanded for a new trial because the trial court had failed to give some cautionary instructions relating to the statements made by the two petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.865" offset="338840">This happened more than 15 months ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.757" offset="350438">The other two defendants in the case have not been tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.259" offset="376456">Prior to the indictment in the federal court in Mississippi, the two defendants had been indicted, with one of the men who was indicted in the federal court of Mississippi on the charge of conspiracy to destroy the properties of the Southern Bell Telephone Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.214" offset="460257">I represented the two petitioners in the trial in Cook County in Chicago, and on a plea of guilty, they were both sentenced to a term of not more than three months.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.122" offset="511875">The sole question in this case is whether or not the petitioners were placed in jeopardy under the Fifth Amendment because of the fact that they had been convicted twice in the state court and then convicted again in the -- in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.854" offset="602781">Now, the facts in this case are of extreme importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.828" offset="618663">The law has been very carefully analyzed.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.716" offset="634232">I know of Mr. Fisher personally from Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.029" offset="647502">As Your Honors have said, he's a very able lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.190" offset="660146">He made a great research under the law in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.016" offset="679476">And much of the law that I have in my brief frankly comes from conversation with him and from reading his brief and of course some personal research on our part.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.674" offset="730049">But the facts in this case are extremely important because the Government raises questions that the two offenses were not actually dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.342" offset="780727">And so, I would like to briefly state the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.639" offset="805909">The indictments arise out of activities of some men in connection with a -- with a strike of the Southern Bell Telephone Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.183" offset="856064">A man by the name of Shelby, who was an international representative of the -- of the union, came to Chicago and communicated with a man by the name of (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="198.613" offset="897860">Apparently, he was seeking somebody to help him destroy the communications on the properties of the Southern Bell Telephone Company for the purpose of expediting the settlement of the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.143" offset="951986">This man, (Inaudible), that is the record, communicated with Abbate and told him that he would receive a call from somebody from the South.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.520" offset="997439">Mr. Shelby the representative was a southerner from -- also from Mississippi and lived at the time in Maryland and a man by the name of Perry, who was the -- the president of the local in Jackson, Mississippi where the act of violence had taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.933" offset="1071104">And so, we find that Shelby contacts Mr. Abbate and there is a meeting between Abbate, Falcone and a man by the name of McLeod who was not indicted in this case and Shelby.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.291" offset="1124498">Shelby has with him the plans for the destruction of the -- of the various installations marked.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.326" offset="1152711">Shelby had worked for the Southern Bell Telephone Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.282" offset="1164518">He knew the whereabouts of the various installations.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.654" offset="1177997">So, on the plans, they were located at various spots where he thought they ought to destroy.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.290" offset="1204537">He gave Abbate $500 as a down payment and said that if they carried out their job, there would be more money afforded.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.914" offset="1247065">There is an effort made by Falcone to get some dynamite, I think it was a pretext.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.110" offset="1275800">I don't think Falcone, for the record, could ever get an indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.467" offset="1297220">The next day -- the next day, the petitioners, Abbate and Falcone, tell McLeod.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.276" offset="1320521">McLeod was a man who is on parole from Oklahoma for having committed a robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.040" offset="1347584">They told McLeod that they wanted no part of this deal and that they could make more money by conveying this information to the telephone company.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.729" offset="1386245">They gave him part of the $500 and McLeod insisted on going down to Jackson, Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.879" offset="1414875">McLeod, when he gets to Jackson, Mississippi meets Perry who was the president of the local down there and he also meets Shelby.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.650" offset="1449984">One of the men connected with the union took McLeod around and showed him where the various locations where they were located.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.491" offset="1489377">We expect to show from the record that both Perry and Shelby began to have misgivings about McLeod.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.365" offset="1520828">And so, they took him forcibly.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.511" offset="1529396">He protested.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.276" offset="1532426">He wanted to stay there and blow up the installation.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.135" offset="1543920">But they took him forcibly to a railroad station and sent him back to Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.551" offset="1565550">In the meantime -- in the meantime Abbate and McLeod almost the next day the record shows -- almost the next day after meeting Shelby, communicated with the telephone company and told them that they had information in reference to plans for the destruction of these installations.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.124" offset="1647888">We expect to show at the most perhaps four or five days later there are conversations between Abbate and the officials for the telephone company.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.447" offset="1689161">There was a meeting arranged between the -- the telephone officials who is an investigator and a policeman acting as -- as a member of the -- of the telephone company.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.322" offset="1728658">They meet with Abbate and Falcone at which time the two petitioners are arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.508" offset="1761364">They gave him the plans that Shelby had given them, gave him all the information and reference to this plan with the scheme to destroy this communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.336" offset="1800756">And as part -- and -- and they didn't give him the reward.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.257" offset="1812355">Instead of giving him a reward, they -- they indicted, and charged him with a conspiracy to destroy the property of Southern Bell Telephone Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.335" offset="1844746">Now, the -- the judge who heard this case in the criminal courts of Cook County, I suppose, took into consideration the fact that these men have almost immediately abandoned the enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.658" offset="1898036">I had raised the question on the Court of Appeals that there was abandonment but the Court of Appeals removed otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.688" offset="1930115">And in -- and in Illinois there is no need of an (Inaudible) act -- the mere -- the mere agreement between the parties, a decision to constitute a conspiracy whereas in the federal court, there must be some covered act.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.448" offset="1981210">But the judge took into consideration that these men had come clean.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.593" offset="1997720">They had conveyed all the information, had told it to the telephone company, had informed the police and the State's Attorney, and so the -- why judge gave them not more than 90 days to both defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.361" offset="2056861">After the defendants had served their time, the petitioners had served their time, an attorney for the Southern Bell Telephone Company came to visit McLeod who has been taken back to Oklahoma prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.840" offset="2114748">And this is important because it's in the record and in some ways those -- and refers or to the -- to the other case that Mr. Fisher had, the Bartkus case.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.081" offset="2167724">The attorney for the telephone company came to McLeod and said, "I want your help.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.077" offset="2191653">The telephone company wants your help.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.750" offset="2202415">Now, you can help the telephone company by testifying for the Government." And so -- and so the deal was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.615" offset="2237837">McLeod was never indicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.829" offset="2246719">And I think in my petition for rehearing before the Court of Appeals, I -- I think I stated that there was a news item that appeared in the -- in the Southern Newspapers that McLeod had been given a parole at the instance of the telephone company and had been given a reward of $7500 for his aid of the telephone company.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.446" offset="2333132">But McLeod agrees to testify for the -- the Government and there is this trial and there is this -- this conviction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.143" offset="2379943">Now, it's important to know just what properties the telephone -- the Government had which they claim was the subject of this conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.770" offset="2434487">The evidence shows that it was directed at coaxial -- at a coaxial cable and the evidence showed that the coaxial cable was capable of transmitting 2400 conversations.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.418" offset="2497076">Out of these, the Government had leased, owned, or operate -- or controlled rather, not owned, leased, operated, and controlled 20 circuits of the 2400 circuits of the coaxial cable.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.644" offset="2553919">And so we find that the state prosecution was directed at all the properties of the Southern Bell Telephone Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.372" offset="2588818">The Government takes only 20 circuits out of the 2400 circuits in that coaxial cable and says, "That belongs to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.144" offset="2619956">We'll indict you on that," as that's -- that's what they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.742" offset="2638346">Well, in spite of the fact that the jury perhaps got the grip of what these two petitioners had done and the jury recommended leniency as to one but there wasn't much leniency to get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.853" offset="2698742">And one who has recommended leniency got one year and the others all -- all got three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.400" offset="2724968">Now, it is our position and we concede that the Federal Government within the framework of its constitution and the States may deal with the same subject matter and thereby have concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.628" offset="2793932">And there -- there's no question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.662" offset="2806053">We also concede that each sovereignty within the framework of the Constitution has the right to determine what shall be a defense against the peace and dignity of its sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.743" offset="2850356">However, the dual doctrine should not be extended to areas in which its application causes a violation of the basic concept of justice which occurred in this case where the -- where two men are convicted and given a sentence and then taken -- taken broadly from Chicago and taken back to Mississippi, that is hundreds of miles where they're forced to stand trial so far away from their homes, with all the difficulties that go with a -- with a second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.886" offset="2994866">And there's something basically unjust about convicting a man twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.828" offset="3018689">Mr. Fisher in his -- in his brief says, an -- an acquittal is perhaps worse.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.178" offset="3040110">I -- I disagree with my learned friend.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.660" offset="3050036">I think double convictions are worse.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.048" offset="3059545">I think it's worse to convict a man once and then convict him again.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.117" offset="3103848">We say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.934" offset="3107088">That to permit the -- the doctrine of dual sovereignty to extend to this and to nullify the protection of the Fifth Amendment will leave open a large area of concurrent jurisdiction to which accused persons may not avail themselves of the right of the Fifth Amendment not to be tried twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.897" offset="3203009">I predict, may it please the Court, and I practiced for many years both as a prosecutor and as a defense lawyer, I predict that if -- if these convictions are prevented to stand that it will open up a great distance of prosecution by the Government on the one hand and by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.664" offset="3294020">We're asking no more than the Court to apply what was the common law rule at one time before the -- the so-called (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="811.852" offset="3350758">The Government in its argument says this isn't the same effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.653" offset="3373955">But it is the same effects because the offense in -- in Cook County, Illinois was conspiracy which means an agreement to do an illegal thing or to do unlawful thing by illegal means.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.048" offset="3427558">The charge in the federal court was also a conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.097" offset="3439783">It was again an agreement to do an illegal thing and the -- the gist of a conspiracy is the unlawful combination of men and their punishment for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.962" offset="3491192">And the remarkable thing is that the substance of offense in this case is only punishable by three years, whereas the conspiracy charged here is punishable up to five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.084" offset="3555662">The Government argues in its brief that the federal offense is not the same as the state offense because there's additional element here which had to be proved, though that this operation and control.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.574" offset="3613654">And it is our position that is a matter of jurisdiction just the same as in a -- in a civil -- in a -- in a state case.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.278" offset="3648449">The -- the prosecutor must prove that it occurred within a certain county in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.420" offset="3669034">And there is really no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.729" offset="3678333">I see no difference but a verbal difference between the charge contained in the indictment in Illinois and the indictment contained in the -- in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.483" offset="3737266">It is argued by the Government that it is not advisable to permit a state prosecution to preclude federal enforcement of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.910" offset="3779062">We don't quarrel about that the Federal Government has a right to enforce the law but they could have tried -- they could have tried the petitioners before the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.709" offset="3830157">The field could have been preempted if it was of that importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.851" offset="3850742">If it was of that importance to the Government, Congress could have preempted the field and still has no excuse for convicting a man twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.059" offset="3891597">And this is the first time this Honorable Court has had a chance to pass on this exciting question and we submit as Mr. Fisher stated, the Lanza case isn't a -- isn't a question involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.863" offset="3954813">The Government argues that -- that it would mean, and raise of offenders to the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.088" offset="4003715">Well, we didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.453" offset="4021164">We didn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.009" offset="4035375">I think the state courts are competent to handle crimes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1271.505" offset="5189360">In the -- in the Bartkus case, the legislative history of the bank robbery statutes shows that those statutes were enacted to aide what was basically a local law enforcement problem to aide the States in protecting banks against robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.724" offset="5286222">It was first -- the -- the State, the local law enforcement problem, there were subsequently the federal statute which was enacted to aide the States in enforcing the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.422" offset="5345050">With respect to this statute however, the legislative history indicates that it was enacted after the Civil War.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.071" offset="5379636">It was enacted as a military measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.654" offset="5389981">It was referred to the House Military Affairs Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.252" offset="5404400">During the Civil War, the -- the Federal Government nationalized the telegraph facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.767" offset="5426448">And any act destructive of those facilities was -- was an enemy act, and very severely punished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.763" offset="5454451">Subsequently, legislation was enacted authorizing private companies to operate telegraph facilities and to use the public domain, giving certain priorities to the Federal Government and giving the Federal Government the power to repurchase, to -- to purchase the property, to nationalize the telegraph facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.969" offset="5555284">Ultimately, it was decided as -- as the case today that that private industry would -- would operate the telegraph facilities, but -- but this statute which was passed in 1874, and as -- as I say, was referred to and recommended by the House Military Affairs Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.833" offset="5634696">It was designed to protect the interest, the direct primary interest in the Federal Government in maintaining its -- its vital communication facilities free from destruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.647" offset="5686000">There is no history here of the federal legislation being designed to aide the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.512" offset="5713377">And -- and the -- the interest of Illinois in this case is the interest of a State in its police power in protecting private property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.842" offset="5750784">Illinois has a -- has a common law conspiracy of crime, a common law conspiracy.And it was that -- that statute which was violated in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.324" offset="5800626">Illinois protecting private property, and as a matter of fact, it was an essential element of the Illinois crime that the particular private ownership be alleged, and -- and had there been a trial, had there been a plea of guilty, it would have been essential element for the Illinois to prove the private ownership of that property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.228" offset="5904280">We submit that however adequate Illinois may have regarded the three-month sentence imposed upon petitioners for having conspired to destroy property located not in Illinois, but located in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.780" offset="5966451">That is not the measure of a Federal Government to protect its communication facilities.</text>
