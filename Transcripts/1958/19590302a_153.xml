            <text syncTime="19.105" offset="179806">There, on two consolidated appeals here, which seek to review two decisions of the Supreme Court of Florida, these decisions replaced two decrees of the Circuit Court of Dade County.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.801" offset="250546">The decrees in the Circuit Court of Dade County were entered in two suits, both brought against the City of Miami.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.776" offset="278444">One suit was brought by Ganger as a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.573" offset="293700">The other suit was brought by Hamilton as a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.330" offset="308642">Both suits challenged the legality of certain special assessments which the City of Miami had laid upon the properties of persons owning property along certain streets in the town.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.763" offset="362454">And the gravamen of the complaints in both cases were that there were no special benefits acclaimed to the property owners as a result of the -- of the proceedings and that the property owners had no notice of the administrative proceedings which resulted in the imposition of the assessment liens.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas H. Anderson</label>
            <text syncTime="118.338" offset="576763">It's raised in the complaint in paragraph -- in paragraph 12 on page 6 of the record, which the -- the complaint alleges that the special assessment lien sought to be imposed upon the abutting property owners in highway improvement district H477, are illegal and void and constitute taking this property in violation of the Constitution of the United States and the State of Florida upon the following grounds, (a), (b), and (c) on page 7 of the record, the notice was published in an inconspicuous place upon the classified advertising section of the Miami Herald, the position in which it was least likely to attract the attention of persons such as the plaintiffs and those on whom this -- on whose behalf this suit was brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.237" offset="784280">And the court below found, that is the Circuit Court of Dade County, found that the notice was insufficient as a matter of law and set aside the assessments upon that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.241" offset="840286">Now, Your Honors, you have, of course, anticipated me, in the presentation of the federal question involved, which is whether or not, a municipality in the imposition of the special assessment lien may use as the only notice which it gives to the affected property owners that published on the local newspaper where the owners are residents of the area in which the proceedings are brought and their names and addresses are in the possession of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.866" offset="962853">The facts in the case are briefly these.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.745" offset="982392">The City of Miami decided to resurface certain arterial highways which had become worn thin and to make the same more suitable for the passage of traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.941" offset="1039130">The streets had originally been put in at the cost of the abutting property owners who had paid for the entire amount, except for the intersection.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.817" offset="1074657">So the city proceeded onto its charter to do the work and that determination of the work laid in assessment upon the abutting property owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.518" offset="1117393">Within 60 days after the imposition of the liens and the receiving of the notices which was sent to them by mail, although the only notice that they received was in the newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.234" offset="1172355">Within 60 days after they received the bills, the property owners organized themselves into two groups and proceeded to bring these separate actions challenging the legality of these assessments.The city defended the suits upon the ground that the property owner were estopped to allege and to prove that these assessments did not result in benefits to their properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.438" offset="1281128">Of course, so the city said and the city charter provides that the property owners would have notice by -- by notices published in the local newspapers and that the notices were so published.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.565" offset="1337657">The Circuit Court after taking a substantial amount of testimony, found contrary to the city's position in both cases and enter decrees in which it found that there were no benefits included to the properties, no special benefits included to the properties as a result of the resurfacing that it had been done to facilitate the flow of traffic, that the work had actually been paid for by surfaces accumulated from budgetary estimates in prior years, that the notices were insufficient as a matter of law and enjoined the collection of the assessments.</text>

            <text syncTime="350.578" offset="1505677">There were two notices in the course of the proceedings, both published in the local -- local newspapers, Justice Clark.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.425" offset="1533053">The city appealed to the Supreme Court of Florida from that decree or from those decrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.203" offset="1560221">And the Supreme Court of Florida affirmed the decrees by a divided court that is 4-to-3, on a nonfederal ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.719" offset="1598255">The majority opinion in that case expressly said, "That the Court recognized that in some stage in the proceedings in order to satisfy the requirements of due process, notices had to be given."</text>
            <text syncTime="387.400" offset="1653008">But he said, "The notices were given as was required by the statute and therefore, that part of the decree, they said, was wrong and they disagreed with the chancellor.</text>

            <text syncTime="412.562" offset="1753631">But in the trial of the proceedings, the entire administrative proceedings were introduced in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.166" offset="1780067">And the -- and the proceedings show that both notices were published in the local newspapers so the same vice attaches to the second notice as it did to the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.980" offset="1819251">And I think the court below treated it all as one receipt and one notice, which in fact it was, although, there were two separate stages of the game at which the notice was given.</text>

            <text syncTime="456.383" offset="1928861">Briefly, the proceedings provided for all these, when the city decides to -- to initiate a public improvement such as the resurfacing or the painting the street, it adopts what is known as an initiating resolution and it gives the property owner notice of the fact that that resolution has been adopted and requiring him, if he so desires, to appear and contest it.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.266" offset="2032410">Now, the notice does not -- is not required to specify any names or any individuals and the notice, in this case, was published directed to or whom it may concern or some such vague reference as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.607" offset="2077759">All persons interested may take notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.841" offset="2090715">Then when the initiating resolution has been confined by a resolution, the city then proceeds to offer or to invite bids for the doing of the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.805" offset="2138572">And when they are received, they decide then either to let to work out on contract, its own, or to let a contract for the doing of the work by said persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.458" offset="2181204">Then when the work is done and during that course of time, a special assessment role is made up.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.490" offset="2217357">And when the work is completed and the cost of doing the work has been exactly determined, a special assessment rule, a preliminary rule is corrected to show the actionable facts, and then the city gives another notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.070" offset="2275662">This time, twice in a daily newspaper published in the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.746" offset="2294366">And at that time, the property owners are required to come and register their objections if they have any, to the imposition of these assessment liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.802" offset="2334595">And if their objections are overruled, they may then, within 10 days after the confirmation of the rule, bring a special proceeding in the Circuit Court of Dade County to the Circuit Court, in which they may challenge the legality of the assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.375" offset="2396871">And in that proceeding, the Circuit Court has jurisdiction to review the entire matter and to set aside the assessment either as to individual lots or upon the entire district.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.847" offset="2446712">That procedure was followed in this case with the result that I theretofore state.</text>

            <text syncTime="741.002" offset="3067382">But I did not tell the Court the grounds on which that affirmation rested.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.355" offset="3084831">The majority opinion said that the City of Miami, under its charter, had no statutory power to assess for resurfacing as distinguished from repeating.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.741" offset="3142301">And so the decree was affirmed upon a work or statutory power in the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.498" offset="3169364">One of the justices filed a especially concurring opinion in which he said that evidence are bounded to support the Court's finding that there were no special benefits in support for this assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.580" offset="3229654">And on that ground, he was willing to put his position.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.415" offset="3245014">And, of course, the law had plain that if there were no benefits, there was no constitutional basis for the -- the assessment, whether the party had noticed or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.918" offset="3287019">The city petitioned for rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.566" offset="3297677">And in the petition for rehearing, it is asserted that the judge who had filed this concurring opinion and whose presence on there side was essential because they were four from outside and three at fault, that that judge had overlooked the fact that the notice has been given as required by the charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.284" offset="3376462">And so on the strength of that petition for rehearing, a -- a rehearing was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.736" offset="3402271">And when the cause came on to be heard on rehearing, we obtained -- we filed with the court a brief, a printed copy which I have here, certified to by the clerk of the court, in which I should like to ask Your Honors' leave to file with the Clerk of this Court, in which we precisely raised the question decided by this Court in the city -- or in Walker against the City of Hutchinson and called this -- the Supreme Court of Florida's attention to the fact that that assertion had been entered in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2006.556" offset="8129599">And I might say, I believe, it was after they had announced that they were going to hear -- had granted the city's petition for rehearing, but before it had been acted upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.016" offset="8171395">Now, that motion sets forth the fact that Darlow or that Shaw wrote a letter to Darlow with respect to District 508.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.334" offset="8212668">Informing him that -- that resurfacing was not going to be subject to a special assessment, but it was going to be paid out the proceeds of a bond issued to be guaranteed by revenues from the Florida Power &amp; Light Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.872" offset="8270869">It is also significant in that letter that the city admits that their procedures there were void because they said, "Consequently, after the district was ordered and confirmed, we purposely failed to adhere to the charter requirement of hearing objections on the completed work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.472" offset="8349236">Thus, in effect, made the district invalid as far as the assessments were concerned."</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.042" offset="8367522">And then proceeded in the next paragraph to say that the City Attorney's Office had advice them not to do anything about the liens with respect to this new District 508, until this other litigation was disposed of referring to Hamilton and Ganger which were 447 and 503.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.641" offset="8445889">Now, the significance of this matter is this, in the Hamilton case which is 477 and the Ganger case which is 503, we are dealing with downtown streets in the City of Miami.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.544" offset="8513599">The City of Miami, the hub of it, is the corner of Flagler Street and North Miami Avenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.695" offset="8538154">And the avenues go north and the avenues go south.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.927" offset="8551111">North Miami -- North and South Miami avenue room -- run right up to the heart of town.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.883" offset="8574934">In this District 477, they levied an assessment on these downtown streets against these abutting property owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.744" offset="8610356">But when they come to District 508, which connects with North Miami Avenue, a very street which was inbound in 477 and in fact, took up where District 477 left off, they didn't make an assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.163" offset="8680051">They paid it on the general funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.548" offset="8689560">And the logic of that is in the reverse, because the further North you get to Miami Avenue, the further out you are from the heart of town.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.810" offset="8722578">If logic were to prevail in this situation, it was the downtown property that should've been paid out, general funds and not the further outlying districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.776" offset="8758523">I say to this Court that I have never seen a municipality impose liens with such ranked discrimination as has been shown with respect to these two districts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3086.058" offset="12447640">Of course, in our answer, we said, he had no authority to represent except those two to three in each case who would employ.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.349" offset="12476792">But he brought a class action saying that he represented all of those classes that had paid, they wanted their money back and those who hadn't paid and the judge in his final decree, which I want to mention to you, doesn't mention the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.420" offset="12553070">And in that decree, he appointed a special master and the master then, it hasn't gotten that far because the Supreme Court of Florida reversed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.602" offset="12593821">That special master would have found what an attorney's fee should be paid to counsel who represented the class from each and every one of those people, of those who had paid, if they get their money back and of those who hadn't paid, they would have to pay.</text>
