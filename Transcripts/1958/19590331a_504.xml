            <label>Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="17.838" offset="174686">May it please the Court, the petitioner instituted this suit in this District Court for the District of Columbia for injunctive and declaratory release against the action of the Defense Department in finding him a security risk and denying him access to classified information without allowing him to confront the secret informants on whose statements the defense department's action against him was predicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.028" offset="303522">Petitioner is here on certiorari from a decision of the District Court dismissing petitioner's complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.784" offset="338526">Turning to the facts, we respectfully submit and we shall seek to demonstrate to the Court that even the barest outline of the facts will make clear that petitioner presents to this Court a terrifying 480-page record of injustice and far and away the most perfect example of the inherent and inevitable unfairness of non-confrontation yet presented to this Court in any area.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.673" offset="482095">Petitioner was a lathe operator at Bell Aircraft from 1941 to 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.682" offset="518144">Since Bell makes airplanes the Industrial Security Program applied to the confidential secret and top secret information which Bell received in order to manufacture airplanes for the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.818" offset="578644">Mr. Taylor, the petitioner, had a confidential clearance to carry on his work at Bell.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.819" offset="614693">In 1956, Bell, the employer, sought a secret clearance for the petitioner from the Defense Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.448" offset="661191">In September 1956, Bell, the employer, received a notice from the Defense Department, suspending all clearance of petitioner and immediately he was discharged by Bell.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.768" offset="742484">Very shortly thereafter petitioner received charges from the Defense Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.059" offset="771636">This is 1956 and petitioner was charged with having been a member of the Communist Party in 1942 and 1943 and the charges went on you may still be a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.461" offset="853243">He immediately added a categorical denial, asked for a hearing and asked to have the witnesses who charged him with membership in 1942 and 1943 and may still be a member, to be produced for cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.420" offset="917086">In November 1956, we had the so called hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.257" offset="936417">The government produced nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.419" offset="949060">No witnesses, no evidence, no names of the people who had made the statement about Mr. Taylor, but that isn't all and I would ask Your Honors to look at page 131 of the record because I will refer to this again.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.888" offset="1042892">In the fifth line at page 131, the Chairman of the Board assumes that Mr. Taylor is guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.866" offset="1094823">He says at this time it is our intention and the statement of reasons would indicate to consider that these documents, namely the Communist Party card and the Communist Party transfer card with which he is accused of having, exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.179" offset="1168071">Well petitioner had no choice but to go on.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.780" offset="1182490">Here he was before a board that wouldn't tell him who the witnesses were against him assumed his guilt, but he had no choice but to try to prove his innocence.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>

            <label>Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="283.339" offset="1236720">The alleged Communist Party membership card and the alleged Communist Party transfer card.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.779" offset="1258454">When you go -- apparently when you go for a one unit to another there is a transfer card and this was alleged against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.794" offset="1290533">The Chairman of the Board apparently assumed that these existed even though they have been categorically denied under oath by petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.483" offset="1333269">Well petitioner did the only thing a human being could do under those circumstances he tried to prove the negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.446" offset="1357197">He tried to prove the negative of what had happened 13 and 14 years before.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.538" offset="1381543">He testified under oath that he had never been a member of the party, never paid dues, never been to meetings, never done any of the things and never had these cards.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.936" offset="1423130">And 11 witnesses from Bell Aircraft came to support him.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.691" offset="1458134">Now Your Honors will recall that in 1942 and 1943 America was at war on the same side as Russia and the workers, the communist workers had a particular party line against strikes, because they would hold up production to help Russia and for incentive pay because that would give more production.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.335" offset="1544756">And seven of these 11 witnesses testified on behalf of petitioner that he opposed the no strike pledge and that he opposed the incentive pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.715" offset="1590209">In other words, if Your Honors please Mr. Taylor did what I would have thought was impossible, which was to refute overwhelmingly the secret charges against him, but the Board saw it differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.906" offset="1651022">Seven months later in June 1957 the Board issued its first adverse decision to Mr. Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.514" offset="1685400">They said it is true as charged that you were a Communist Party member in 1942 and 1943 despite all this evidence to the contrary and without producing one shred of evidence themselves and you may still be.</text>

            <text syncTime="411.580" offset="1749661">Yes sir, on page 52 if Your Honor please of the record, there is an order saying that the charges were true as stated, it's on page 52.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="422.223" offset="1792293">Between those two times was he out of employment or was he --</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="425.458" offset="1805249">He was out of employment practically completely from September 1956 until December 31, 1958 to which I will come at a later period.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.449" offset="1861151">His loss of employment and livelihood was as the record shows, he had been earning about $5,000 and he was averaging about a $1,000, he was 20% employable as a result of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.924" offset="1915068">Now after this adverse decision in 1952 and 1957, petitioner appealed to the secretary, it's not clear that he had to, you couldn't tell from the regulations whether this was necessary to exhaust his administrative remedies, but in an abundance of caution we did appeal to the secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.886" offset="1998869">Nothing happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.008" offset="2007437">We waited five months hoping for action and then we brought suit in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.542" offset="2033560">In April 1958 two months later, the government said to us, our original decision was reasonable supported but we're going to have a new proceeding anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.740" offset="2090297">Even though we were right the first time, we're going to have a new proceeding now.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.881" offset="2106911">And they gave us new charges, the so called amended charges and look at what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.423" offset="2141080">The new charges said you were a Communist Party member in 1942 and 1943 but you were expelled in 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.977" offset="2187264">They took our defense, which was that he had opposed the Communist Party line and turned it around and said why you were expelled for opposing the Communist Party line.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.672" offset="2250062">What they had found as true in 1957 namely that he was a member of the party in 1942 and 1943, and may still be, they now found he was a member of -- they charged, he was a member of the party in 1942 and 1943 and was expelled in 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.859" offset="2326758">And it wasn't at this moment and it wasn't until later that we learned that the secret informants who first said he may still be a member of the party down to date had tailored their stories to show that he had been expelled and gave us the reason, his own defense at the first hearing.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="578.571" offset="2417664">When the synopsis of the confidential informant's reports were put in at the subsequent hearing to which I will come right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.765" offset="2454444">After the amended reasons were given, petitioner made a second categorical denial, a second request for confrontation and we had a, again so called hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.195" offset="2512123">Well there was a hearing in July and there was no confrontation and there was a hearing in August and there was no confrontation.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.383" offset="2536887">But in August of 1958 the Board told us the synopsis of what the confidential informant had said.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.253" offset="2576384">And if you will look on page 102 of the record, you will what I mean when I say that the secret informants had tailored their stories to rationalize what the witnesses had said at the first hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.837" offset="2654751">Chairman Waldman on page 102 states these confidential sources, and about two-thirds of the way down the page, he refers to Taylor being reproved and finally expelled for making public statements against the incentive pay and in favor of a strike policy, that the matter had turned full circle.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.547" offset="2753599">The informants had been coached to utilize the very material which petitioner and his witnesses had gotten, had given at the first hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.937" offset="2803127">And if Your Honors please, there is not line in the government's brief, not one line in anyway challenging the statement of facts which I have given you, even though every one of them appears in full in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.556" offset="2877628">Furthermore this same synopsis show that these men, the secret informants, were not professional undercover agents but were casual informants and the government concedes this by trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.039" offset="2935515">Furthermore this shows that these people were unseen by the Board, in other words this is not a case of where Board knew what we didn't know, and the government concedes this.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.685" offset="2986088">Despite this on October 13th we received our second adverse decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.345" offset="3008763">This time the Board said, having previously said you were a member and may still be, now they said you were a member, but you were expelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.793" offset="3050559">But that wasn't enough, they went on and in the first civil administrative finding of guilt of perjury that I have seen, they said you gave false and misleading information deliberately and willfully when you told us you had not been a member of the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.700" offset="3130180">On October 14th, the next day, our motion for cross motions for summary judgment came on in the District Court, and the District Court dismissed our complaint on the basis of the Court of Appeals decision in Greene, that there was no justiciable controversy, I might mention at this point that the government now concedes the error of that, that there is standing to sue by both petitioner Greene and petitioner Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.259" offset="3244387">However at that time the government was maintaining there was no standing to sue, the District Court accepted that and did dismiss our compliant because the Greene case was pending here.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.298" offset="3288586">We brought certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.062" offset="3295587">This Court granted certiorari on December 15th.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.091" offset="3311783">Now, if I may just state a summary of the six admitted facts are controverted by the government's brief, one word and not I am sure to be controverted by the Solicitor General here this afternoon, six admitted and conceded facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.894" offset="3398928">First the petitioner was twice found a security risk, with the loss of job, livelihood and reputation on the basis of accusations of secret informants without one shred of evidence ever having been produced anywhere against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.785" offset="3462562">Two that the first charge that petitioner had been a Communist and maybe still be was answered overwhelmingly by 12 witnesses, 11 plus petitioner, but he was found guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.660" offset="3513971">Three, that the second charge which was inconsistent with the first charge, the petitioner had been a member of the Communist Party and had been expelled, was based on tailored stories, and yet he was found guilty again.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.520" offset="3569455">Fourth, that the secret informants were casual informants and not professional agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.738" offset="3598294">Fifth, that the Board never saw these secret informants, did not know their identities or anything about them.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.346" offset="3628805">Six, that the Board relied as a synopsis on page 102 of the record show, they relied on second, third and fourth degree hearsay.</text>

            <text syncTime="1008.997" offset="4139342">Now, these are the admitted facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.798" offset="4166614">As we pointed out in our reply brief, this argument this afternoon is like shadowboxing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.997" offset="4211336">We've filed a brief with these facts in it and we argue the merits on these facts and the government refused to respond to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.869" offset="4262849">Now let me make this bluntly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.952" offset="4279150">Here is a petitioner before this Court, asking this Court's relief and the government refuses to respond on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.333" offset="4312691">In a sentence the government said, will the Supreme Court kindly read our brief in another case on different facts, which maybe totally inapplicable, and therefore I suggest that it is in a sense shadowboxing to have to argue this afternoon without the benefit of a meeting brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.460" offset="4405164">Now I say to Your Honors that it is not surprising that the government is unwilling to defend the conduct which I have described, which it has conceded, but what is surprising, and to me a little sad, is that the government is unwilling to confess the error action which it is also unwilling to defend, but taking our argument and putting it up against the government's brief in Greene, I come now to the issue of denial of due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.100" offset="4555734">You can put it either way it seems to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.137" offset="4567960">You can put it as an absolute or as a relative standard of due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.013" offset="4599411">We do it both ways in our brief; first as an absolute standard and second as a relative standard, and show in both instances that there has been a violation of petitioner's liberty and property without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.836" offset="4686764">Adverting first to the absolute standard, we deal with this at pages 20 to 26 of our brief and I believe we demonstrate that this Court has consistently held confrontation to be a minimum requirement of the due process imposed on governmental action affecting substantial interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.084" offset="4775685">Now it is hard for anyone to controvert the substantial interest here, his job, his livelihood and his reputation, the interest as substantial as any that a human being can have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.850" offset="4842768">As we read Wyman and Slochower, a man is protected even in government employment, against arbitrary dismissal and arbitrary action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.645" offset="4897938">Private employment, where the government cuts across that, would seem to be an obviously a fortiori situation, and that our case shows a denial of due process many times worse and many times clearer than Wyman and Slochower.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.318" offset="4980694">Now what does the government say in answer to this?</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.384" offset="4992920">They have to distinguish these cases some way and this is their argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.114" offset="5015803">They say that Wyman and Slochower were not due process fair procedure cases, but were discrimination cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.063" offset="5063659">They say that there is a different right of discrimination against discrimination than there is against arbitrary procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.641" offset="5101902">The government suggests that the Fourteenth Amendment, which protects one's life, liberty and property against due process is more limited in its due process provisions in the Fourteenth Amendment than its equal protection provisions, and this is their argument why Slochower and Wyman don't apply, but if Your Honors please the Court held otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.687" offset="5210154">Mr. Justice Clark's opinions are perfectly clear that those were due process questions that Mr. Justice Clark was dealing within in the Slochower and Wyman cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.199" offset="5252159">There was nothing discriminatory about what happened to Slochower.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.950" offset="5267205">The Court held it was a violation of due process and furthermore, even if one were to accept that there was some difference in the Fourteenth Amendment which I cannot see and which the Solicitor General hasn't pointed out, the history of the Fifth Amendment has been the exact reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.480" offset="5349334">The question under the Fifth Amendment is whether discrimination has been covered at all by the Due Process Clause, whether Equal Protection really was a part of the Fifth Amendment and yet the government says that the only thing we should consider in the Fifth Amendment, the dominant factor is the Due Process Clause, it is the discriminatory aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.516" offset="5437419">Well if Your Honors please, it seems to me that on the decisions of this Court, that there is no basis for applying a relative standard here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.744" offset="5482350">We have a substantial interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.320" offset="5496665">We have an arbitrary action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.813" offset="5506591">We have non-confrontation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.019" offset="5515473">Under the decisions of this Court we submit that our case is proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.881" offset="5538879">But, since the government argues the relative standard, that is the need of the individual for confrontation against the need of the government for secrecy, we are happy to argue it because we do not feel that the situation could be any different, under a relative than under an absolute concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.957" offset="5643160">The government says, let's have a weighing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.095" offset="5655803">Let's weight the need of the individual against the need of the government, all right let's weigh them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.648" offset="5689971">We submit first, that in the first half of this equation, the denial of confrontation in security matters renders them inevitable, unfair and arbitrary, and I use the word inevitable advisably, and I ask Your Honors at some stage to examine pages 29 to 38 of our brief, where we show the inevitable character of unfairness in non-confrontation in security matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.640" offset="5825912">Let me just advert briefly to five points that make it inevitably unfair; first the lapse of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.152" offset="5859976">You can't get witnesses to testify to 42 and 43 to answer every charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.549" offset="5885576">The thing to do is to get the man who makes the charge from 42 and 43 and show that he can't remember.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.208" offset="5912221">Confrontation is important first therefore because of the lapse of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.342" offset="5932701">Secondly the nature of the charges, these are charges of covert and suspect activities, you can't get people and we don't have subpoena power, the government hasn't provided this program with a subpoena power, you can't get people to come in and admit their covert and suspect activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.562" offset="6005635">You've got to get the accuser and try and break the story down at that stage and thirdly there is the danger of false accusations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.265" offset="6044400">I do not need to tell this Court about false accusers in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.775" offset="6062477">Mr. Matusow, Mr. Crouch, Mr. Johnson and Mr. Maezi, all clutter up the books, the records before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.842" offset="6098735">They would men liars under oath, think what damage was done these men as secret informers against people who never saw them, and this very case, and that's the reason I stress this so much at the beginning, in this very case you have witnesses, secret informers who coached to change their stories, then bring in a new story which reconciles petitioner's defense at his first hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.593" offset="6221720">Fourth, the burden of proof is on the defendant, how can you meet the burden of proof of showing your innocence if you can't get at the people who charge you, and fifth, and this in some ways is the worst.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.263" offset="6280443">This is the reductio ad absurdum of this program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.808" offset="6294653">The boards never see these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.691" offset="6310118">Now just, what does the board have in (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.043" offset="6323493">It has 12 people swearing to this man's innocence and it has a sheet of paper on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.346" offset="6348779">It has to weigh a sheet of paper against testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.270" offset="6372498">You cannot weigh a sheet of paper against testimony and the proof is you cannot weigh it is why I asked Your Honors to look at page 131 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.511" offset="6421400">You assume, the Board in this kind of a weighing process, assumes guilt, either the paper is right or its wrong, there is no way to compare the paper against the oral witnesses, so what does the Board do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.866" offset="6498826">Right at the outset they assume that the paper was right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.552" offset="6509589">The paper I'm referring to was his statement that the -- which was a report from the intelligence agency saying there was a Communist Party card and a Communist Party transfer card.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.663" offset="6562043">So what does he do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.462" offset="6569253">He assumes that that's true, you can no more weigh 12 honest and honorable witnesses against the sheet of paper from an intelligence agency than a mathematician can count up apples and pears.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.623" offset="6617840">They have no relationship.</text>

            <text syncTime="1926.207" offset="7808188">Now if Your Honors please, these are by governmental admission and our deduction from the record but primarily I think it's simpler to take the governmental admission casual informants, not undercover agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.937" offset="7867120">I'd like to make clear that I don't think it would be any different if they were professional FBI agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.469" offset="7889272">But as I -- when I was arguing the (Inaudible) case it was suggested I was carrying more water on my shoulders than necessary, I'm not going to do that this afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.793" offset="7926575">These were casual informants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.824" offset="7942666">Every observer of this program has suggested that the casual informants not be treated as secret informants, that they be confronted, that they be used as witnesses, and I ask particularly if Your Honors will examine these at pages 42 to 46 of our brief, the government -- the Commission on Government Security, Mr. Wild Bill -- the late Wild Bill Donovan and an expert in this area, the Johnson Committee, the Commission of the Association of the Bar, every single expert who has looked into this says there is no reason for protection of these casual informants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.077" offset="8131688">And there is another man I want to refer to because I find it even as significant as those and that's a former Solicitor General of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.493" offset="8177351">On page 44 of our brief we quote Mr. Furman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.694" offset="8198144">Mr. Furman stood before this Court where I stand eight years ago and persuaded the Court four to four to keep the confrontation system, the non-confrontation system in effect through the Bailey case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2146.008" offset="8687365">Now I don't know just how to -- exactly to say this, but I would make the suggestion in all deference that this Court cannot let America's chief policeman decide that the Bill of Rights won't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.299" offset="8752567">We have been very careful to bring in here in our brief every observer of this program and they have been unanimous, that we must get away from this non-confrontation and I do not as I said before think anybody can say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.615" offset="8837831">Now, if Your Honors please I respectfully submit that whether you treat the due process standard as relative or absolute, we have met it and that there has been a deprivation of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.770" offset="8898435">Having said that much I have to confess that I do not think the point will be reached in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.417" offset="8933021">I do not think that the government has shown a statutory base or a constitutional base for what has occurred here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.547" offset="8981608">If I may -- there are two different reasons why I do not believe there is a statutory basis for this program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.257" offset="9016404">In our brief at pages 50 to 56 we demonstrate that whatever statutes the government rely on for this program are equally consistent with confrontation as with non-confrontation, and therefore obviously this Court is going to take the confrontation interpretation when so serious a constitutional issue arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.498" offset="9129357">The government in their brief makes no answer to this at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.619" offset="9149837">The government does not challenge anywhere in their brief our point three pages 50 to 56 that the statutes if there are any setting up this program should be interpreted as providing for confrontation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.964" offset="9223189">There is another statutory point which was primarily stressed by my brother Berueffy in his case, the Greene case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.217" offset="9264253">We primarily stress the point that the statutory base, whatever it was, is equally consistent with confrontation and non confrontation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.992" offset="9303333">He primarily stressed the point that there wasn't any statutory base at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.940" offset="9327156">And the government practically concedes that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.878" offset="9338859">I use the word practically because it's not -- they do not concede it in so many words, but on page 26 of the government's brief in Greene they appear to say, well it's inherent power or nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.677" offset="9398105">So the choice it seems to me this Court has is whether to say there is no statutory authority for non-confrontation or to say there is no statutory authority at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.182" offset="9448051">It seems to me that this is a choice of ground, possibly the fact that the government completely concedes our point and only partially concedes the other one would make the point I have suggested in our brief the more likely one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.133" offset="9515865">The government relies on something wholly different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.605" offset="9525791">The government relies on the inherent executive power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.671" offset="9546062">Mr. Rankin is proposing to this Court that the government be allowed to have a program for screening three million Americans that affects the lives, jobs, livelihood, reputation of all these people, not through Congress but through some power of the President as Executive and as Commander-in-Chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.633" offset="9649925">I respectfully suggest that the Youngstown (Inaudible) and Kent cases went way beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.119" offset="9679809">If the ad hoc emergency seizure of the steel mills was not within the inherent power as Commander-in-Chief, certainly a permanent screening process of three million American is not within it, but here too I don't think the Court will ever reach this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.391" offset="9756923">No President has ever asserted this power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.989" offset="9771342">There is no delegation of authority from the President to the Defense Department asserting this power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.776" offset="9798510">This Court is being asked today to decide an inherent executive power which the executive has never said he asserts, certainly on the same principle of one does not decide a constitutional issue if statutory constructions will make possible its avoidance, so one does not decide the inherent power exists if the President himself has not made abundantly clear that, that power is there and that he asserts it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.511" offset="9913448">There is not a word presented to this Court evidencing that any President of the United States has ever suggested that he has this inherent executive --</text>

            <text syncTime="2726.624" offset="11009860">Then on February 13th the government filed a memorandum in reply and they changed their story completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.808" offset="11046640">They practically admitted that the mere clearance under this strange way of clearing was not enough to render this case moot, but they said we've got a change in our whole method of operation which will protect this man.</text>

            <text syncTime="3889.743" offset="15662373">For him and the probabilities in the system are that by reason of the nature of his work as a lathe operator or a die and tool maker, that he would never have occasion for top secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="3903.896" offset="15719006">But the request is made by the employer and the employer is under contract with the government that he will not make these secrets known to anyone who is not properly cleared.</text>
            <text syncTime="3915.791" offset="15766549">So the -- he signs an application to cover that point, what is called the personnel security questionnaire in which he knows -- he is asked all these questions, he is advised what it's for and that he is subject to this if he is going to work on defense contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3932.524" offset="15833422">And no contractor is permitted by his contract to work on government defense contracts without agreeing that he will withhold government secrets from anybody that isn't cleared.</text>
            <text syncTime="3944.940" offset="15883160">So the process was that someone like Taylor, the company would ask, will you -- will the government, because for beyond confidential and in case of derogatory information even for confidential, the government as distinguished from the employer had to make the clearance, so the company would write to the government or bring the matter to the attention of the government and ask them, whether they would clear Taylor and they asked for a secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="3975.477" offset="16005308">Up to that time he had confidential.</text>
            <text syncTime="3978.280" offset="16016488">An investigation was made and the information developed the derogatory information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3984.152" offset="16039999">And then the practice at that time under the regulations and all cases was that if that question came up, everybody was considered as though he was to receive top secret information even though the request was, as to derogatory information for confidential or merely for clearance as to secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="4008.214" offset="16136234">When that came to our attention, it seemed to the department and the Defense Department felt the same way upon examination of it, that it was, here is a man that by the very nature of his occupation, they couldn't describe a situation where they thought he would ever be exposed to top secret information, where company would ever desire, because of the very nature of his work to ever ask for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4034.234" offset="16240306">And yet he was asked to pass test, necessarily different and higher as to the standard that he would have to comply with to have access to that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="4048.156" offset="16295999">So we suggested and the departments working together that the test should be changed in regard to the clearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4055.733" offset="16326301">And that it should be as to each request and no higher so that when they asked for Taylor's clearance for secret the standard was that and if they later asked for something top secret, then you applied the top secret and didn't make Taylor or John Smith or anybody else live up to top secret standards in order to be get secret or confidential.</text>
            <text syncTime="4079.049" offset="16419610">It seemed to be basically unsound way to administer the program.</text>

            <text syncTime="4523.331" offset="18196668">By these letters, this is to -- from the department to the Bell Aircraft Corporation, by these letters you are informed first that any existing security clearance Mr. Taylor then had should be suspended and second that after considering all the available information, it had been determined that the granting of clearance to Charles Allen Taylor for access to classified defense information was not clearly consistent with the interests of national security, and then it goes on, subsequent to June 1957 Mr. Taylor's case was subject to further consideration by this department.</text>
            <text syncTime="4565.752" offset="18366360">After considering all the available information, it has been determined that the granting of clearance to Mr. Taylor for access to secret defense information is in the national interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="4684.863" offset="18842833">Now the difficulty we have about the job being a consideration is at the same time we did in the Department of Justice and working with the Defense Department, think that the element of the job as well as the level of clearance were factors that should be taken into consideration in fairness to the man in the program, because various jobs might have access only for ten minutes a day, and another job might be six or eight hours and the whole program of security is based on the need to know concept, but nobody, even though he is cleared at the very top scientists and under acute clearance in the Atomic Energy Program, does not get to see the secrets of the government unless he needs to.</text>

            <text syncTime="6706.185" offset="26928149">So that means that you can't keep a secret that of prime importance to the life of our company in the Pentagon and never let it out.</text>

            <text syncTime="6776.883" offset="27210898">Now if Mr. Taylor can be trusted with secret information that he needs for the job he ought to have it and the government ought to be able to get the fruits of his labor and not be condemned for it and then it's the question what is -- as far as we can go in trying to protect the information and still make it possible for this country to have its secrets and develop its defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="6805.280" offset="27324479">And certainly we can't -- this Court can't just close it's eyes to the proposition as I see it, with all due respect to the fact we are in a race with people who would like to destroy us and in that race are things that we don't want them to know, the moment we develop them or think of them or get them into creation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6830.121" offset="27423848">We'd like to have them have as much as lag as possible behind us when we get that done and the problem is, we shouldn't hurt any citizen in any particular if it can be avoided.</text>

            <text syncTime="6885.071" offset="27643695">So it isn't a simple problem of whether or not Taylor has been hurt in this situation and that's very important, but you've got to also keep in mind that nobody tried or intended, that this program was never devised for the purpose of hurting Taylor or anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="6911.126" offset="27747871">It was devised to protect this country and the state it was established on that kind of a basis, and then how much can you do in conducting the program and protect both the interest, the very life of this country, as well as the citizen's interest.</text>
