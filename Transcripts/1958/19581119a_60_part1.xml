            <label>Mr. David Rein</label>
            <text syncTime="18.690" offset="178134">May it please of Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.045" offset="187538">This case is here to review a conviction for contempt for refusing to produce certain records before the Subcommittee on Internal Security of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.683" offset="238111">The time of the incidence which led to the indictment on this case, the petitioner, Abram Flaxer, who was National President of the National Labor Union, the United Public Workers of America, this union organized members and various continental agencies, federal, state, county, and municipal governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.345" offset="328704">In 1951, about which is the time at which the subpoena was served upon him which led to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.182" offset="360051">This union had approximately 35,000 members.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.382" offset="380949">On this number, only about 5% were employed in the Federal Government mostly in the Bureau of Engraving and the Post Office Department and of the Records Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.869" offset="438836">The remaining members of the union were employed in state governments, county governments, and municipal governments throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.354" offset="472795">On September 19th, 1951, petitioner was served with subpoena duces tecum from the Subcommittee on Internal Security of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.151" offset="520025">This subpoena called to the production of the union's records including certain financial data of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.304" offset="552626">And of the issue which is raised by the indictment in this case, also the names and addresses of all of the union members employed by the Federal Government and the names and addresses of all union members employed by state, county, or municipal governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.666" offset="630053">The subpoena bought a signature of Senator McCarran, he was at that time Chairman of the Subcommittee.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.463" offset="653249">The subpoena contained no information as to the subject under inquiry or the reason why the Subcommittee was interested the information.It appears from the record that the subpoena had been prepared by members of the staff and the Subcommittee and apparently without any formal advance approval or authorization by the Subcommittee itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.266" offset="736423">Petitioner appeared in response to this subpoena before the Subcommittee on October 5th, 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.555" offset="765576">Only one member of the Subcommittee was present at the time, Senator Watkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.719" offset="786265">At the outset of the hearing, petitioner preceded -- objected the proceeding in the absence of a quorum, stating that he did not believe that a single Senator constituted a quorum.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.986" offset="831300">Senator Watkins overruled this objection saying that under the rules of the Senate and of the Subcommittee, he did constitute a quorum for all purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.186" offset="868080">At this hearing, petitioner produced as demanded by the subpoena, the union records would show the amount, the source, and placement deposit of the union's funds, and also organizations to which the union has contributed during the past 12 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.131" offset="935894">He was asked and he answered various questions concerning the method of operation of the union and the number of distribution of its members among various governmental agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.847" offset="982810">He brought however, producing the names and addresses of the union's members.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.793" offset="1006529">He argued, and I like to turn now to page 7 of our brief in which we quote from the record in which he stated his position as to why he did not wish to produce all the list -- the membership list of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.308" offset="1064626">He said that this demand invaded the right of the union to the privacy of its membership records.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.578" offset="1089703">And the experience of this country had taught that invasions of this privacy were served to -- to compile blacklists for the sole purpose of destroying unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.119" offset="1135888">And he said, and I'm quoting now, "Every individual who joins the union, joins it with the confidence and trust supported by tradition and law that the act of joining and maintaining membership is a personal right and freedom that isn't violative."</text>
            <text syncTime="273.468" offset="1197223">A request such as the present constitutes a wholesale invasion of such privacy, and the right to be let alone which is protected by the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.126" offset="1231914">Every trade union member imposes a special trust in these union offices to protect and preserve that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.164" offset="1260022">Therefore, to submit to the request in this subpoena would be a violation of the trust imposed in me by my membership and the betrayal of the entire trade union movement in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.666" offset="1302026">I have no doubt that not a single union president which find it possible to comply with such a request.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.527" offset="1329507">He said, "I'm confident that the members of this committee, after considering my views and after studying the full implications of their request made in this subpoena realized its conflict with the basic union traditions of this country now incorporated to federal law and withdraw the demand for membership lists."</text>
            <text syncTime="326.077" offset="1407666">He added at the time that he did not have -- he had not compiled in advance this list of union members because he considered the demand to be an improper one.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.754" offset="1450402">Senator Watkins directed him to produce the membership list.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.122" offset="1467852">Nevertheless, at this point, petitioner asked for reconsideration of this request, arguing that the demand for the list was in violation of a national policy against an employer asking the names of the union members.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.684" offset="1526157">Senator Watkins replied that there was no law holding that the United States itself could not find out the names of members in its employees who belonged to a union.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.846" offset="1570774">Counsel for the committee, Mr. Arens then asked petitioner, "How long it would take him to compile this information?"</text>
            <text syncTime="374.485" offset="1601285">Petitioner replied that he probably could compile it in about a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.631" offset="1617899">Although he did not have a membership list of the kind called for in the subpoena, the information was available to him for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.618" offset="1649873">Senator Watkins thereupon ordered the petitioner to produce the information within 10 days from the date of the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.317" offset="1676622">That is October 5th.</text>

            <text syncTime="570.739" offset="2386317">The Senator replied to the petitioner at that time that this was an executive session of the Subcommittee and that the records were not necessarily be made public, to which the petitioner replied, and I'm quoting now from page 9 of the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.104" offset="2463744">"So, on that I don't see any good purpose that these records would serve even if I were to produce them.</text>

            <text syncTime="602.078" offset="2511705">Senator Watkins said that he was not promising that they would not be made public because he did not think that the Government had to make such a promise to get the information.</text>

            <text syncTime="674.722" offset="2802291">At the trial, the Government introduced in evidence only two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.138" offset="2827891">One, or -- well, I should say, they introduced the subpoena, they introduced the transcript of what occurred at the Subcommittee hearing, which was succinctly as I have put it to you, and also they put on the stand just one witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.718" offset="2894242">That was Mr. Richard Arens, counsel for the Subcommittee, who was put on the stand to testify as to what the pertinence of -- of this particular demand was.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.305" offset="2944606">Mr. Arens testified that the Subcommittee had information that the petitioner in this case, the Union Secretary Treasurer, a former Negotiation's Director and "certain members of its executive board" were members of the Communist Party.</text>

            <text syncTime="812.489" offset="3353370">The trial court ruled -- denied our motion for judgment of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.665" offset="3369984">It ruled over our objection that the records were pertinent to some subject under inquiry though it never bothered to state what that subject was.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.081" offset="3403734">It also ruled as a matter of law that a quorum had been present.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.078" offset="3419721">The petitioner was convicted on both counts of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.427" offset="3433096">I should indicate that although there was only one subpoena here, the indictments set the refusal to produce in two separate counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.123" offset="3467891">One count covering the refusal to produce the names and address of the members of the union employed by the Federal Government, the second count, alleging a failure to produce the names and addresses of members of the union employed by state, county and, municipal governments throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.728" offset="3546258">This appeal was first heard before a three-judge panel below or before the decision was rendered, it was heard en banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.312" offset="3584606">I think it's important to turn to that first decision of the Court to indicate its theory as to why these records were pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.645" offset="3633925">It's the only place where any theory was expounded anywhere here, and as I gather from the Government's brief, and apparently it's the nature of -- of the Government's theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.628" offset="3677915">And I turn now to page 104 of the record where the majority opinion on the first opinion was written by Judge Wilbur Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.978" offset="3715323">And he said it was because of -- now, I'm reading now from the top of the page 104.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.130" offset="3743848">It was because of congressional alarm reflected on that Act, I'm referring to the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, and other recent legislation that the Subcommittee was authorized to study and investigate the extent, nature, and effects of subversive activities, including the infiltration of labor organizations by persons who are or may be under communist domination.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.311" offset="3852622">Against such a background, the pertinency of the membership list demanded by the subpoena is at once apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.951" offset="3879163">He then said, "The names could be used to check against a list of subversives to determine the extent of infiltration into the union, a matter clearly pertinent under the resolution particularly since this is a Government employees' union even though the names of state and local members are included, regardless of where they were employed, the names of members were pertinent because an investigation of the union was pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.009" offset="3995460">We brought this case here on a petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.026" offset="4011447">This Court without hearing argument vacated the judgment below and sent the case back to the court below to reconsider in the light of this Court's decision in Watkins against United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.953" offset="4067140">On remand, the Court of Appeals again hearing the case en banc affirmed, again affirmed the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.320" offset="4104652">In its opinion, it did not indicate whether it endorsed the views originally expressed by the Court in its original opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.487" offset="4137357">It was entirely silent on that subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.266" offset="4156479">Although one of the principles we believe in Watkins was the important principle as indicated here in the arguments yesterday of balancing invasions against the Bill of Rights against what might appear to be a justification of the Government for the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.329" offset="4232652">The Court gave no consideration to that problem at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.778" offset="4246444">He considered only one question, and that is the question as to whether the petitioner had been informed of the pertinency of the demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.896" offset="4278941">It came to the conclusion to which I will later address myself that it was not necessary to inform him because the petitioner already knew what the -- what the pertinency was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.801" offset="4326588">We contend here that there are at least six separate grounds upon which a judgment of acquittal should have been entered in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.287" offset="4368488">I do not believe that I will have time to cover all of those grounds in my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.825" offset="4386670">I would like just briefly to state what our position is with regard to all of those grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.851" offset="4414777">We state first that the judgement below is erroneous because there is no proof anywhere in this record as to what the subject under inquiry was, as to what the pertinency of the particular demand was to any subject under inquiry, and there is no showing of any legitimate or legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.963" offset="4495235">We contend also that under the doctrine of Watkins, one is to balance, so gross an invasion of the Bill of Rights as it's present here against an asserted government purpose there is nothing to balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.913" offset="4551032">We have only here a gross invasion.We have nothing on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.289" offset="4568482">We contend thirdly that petitioner was not informed as required under Watkins of the pertinency of the demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.170" offset="4604008">We contend also that the resolution strictly as applied here was too vague to furnish us an authorization for compulsory process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.626" offset="4645909">We contend also that the single Senator present was not under the rules of the Senate and under the rules of the Subcommittee itself, a quorum of authority to rule upon petitioner's objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.236" offset="4696273">And we contend finally that in any event, there was clearly no contempt on October 5th which was the date set forth in the indictment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1514.470" offset="6161220">There is nothing in the transcript of the hearing here which would give any indication of any of these elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.467" offset="6189223">And certainly one cannot find it in the vague language of the resolution itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.877" offset="6210853">At the trial all we have in addition to the transcript was the testimony of counsel for the Subcommittee, that the committee had certain information that certain officers of the union, including the petitioner, were members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.471" offset="6273233">And that's all there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.155" offset="6283995">By itself, this does not demonstrate either a subject under inquiry or that the inquiry has a legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.373" offset="6316910">And more important, it certainly shows no rational basis, certainly no legitimate basis for the demand for a list of 35,000 members of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.335" offset="6364662">The court below and the Government here contend that the subject under inquiry, their language, was whether or not there was Communist Party infiltration into the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.196" offset="6416175">We say that there was a number of difficulties with this contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.578" offset="6429654">First, there is nothing in the record to support it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.980" offset="6447313">The Government concedes there is nothing in the record that no one ever said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.714" offset="6470196">If there is however, that one can gather that that was the subject under inquiry from the entire tenor of the proceeding, we would say first, that certainly one cannot gather a subject under inquiry or pertinency with the undisputable clarity that is required in contempt cases as indicated by this Court in Zacher against the United States from the entire tenor of a proceeding particularly since the Government, although it refers to entire tenor, it can appoint to no statement made either by Senator Watkins or by counsel for the Subcommittee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.838" offset="6626722">In addition, we say, even if you examine this tenor from beginning to end and all the way through, you cannot find that subject under inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.550" offset="6661622">What is the tenor of the proceeding?</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.934" offset="6671130">The tenor of the proceeding is that the petitioner was asked certain neutral questions about the method of operation of the union, the number of its members, the distribution of these members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.455" offset="6717210">All of which questions he answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.649" offset="6725987">The only thing that you can gather from the tenor of this proceeding was the fact that the petitioner repeatedly and consistently complained and objected that the sole purpose of this demand was to employ the list for blacklisting purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.629" offset="6793906">That charge, it has, was never reputed or denied by Senator Watkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.693" offset="6818147">The only other thing that we have here is a statement by Senator Watkins during the course of the colloquy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.103" offset="6843747">That there was no reason why the Government was not entitled to know which of its employees belong to a union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.250" offset="6892335">Now we have here a situation where Senator Watkins with the Subcommittee of one, of a Subcommittee of a full -- of a Subcommittee of seven, of a committee of the Senate of one house of our national legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.621" offset="6957850">Now, I think for the Senate there to equate himself with the Government of the United States, and to say that the Government of the United States had a right to know which of its employees belong to a union hardly indicates that the Subcommittee necessarily had that right or that the Subcommittee had a legitimate subject under inquiry even assuming that the Government had such a right.</text>

            <text syncTime="1889.643" offset="7661902">I would also say and I think this Court can clearly take notice that it is extremely unlikely that 1951 at the time when the loyalty program of the Government of the United States had been in full force in effect for a number of years that there were going to be any government employees on any list of subversives.</text>

            <text syncTime="1914.131" offset="7759914">We contended that it's improper even to make this assumption by the court below for a legislative Subcommittee to be in the business of compiling the lists of subversives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.608" offset="7809755">And, I would go so far as to say I cannot see that it would be a proper function of any Government agency to compile such a list.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.800" offset="7842565">The Government in this brief replies, I like to turn to brief 53 as to how they made that contention, and this is the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.119" offset="7887809">It says and I'm reading now from the middle of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.895" offset="7902960">Nor was it necessary for the committee to have had a master list of subversives for the union membership list to have been useful to the committee in its inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.950" offset="7943189">The court below said nothing about any such master list, so termed as petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.663" offset="7966072">But the committee certainly had in its files as a result of its prior investigations, names of persons who there were at least grounds for believing war members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.926" offset="8011107">I submit that this does not show that the purpose is anymore legitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.018" offset="8027408">It merely shows that a list is not a comprehensive or good list or a master list.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.551" offset="8053530">It merely shows that it would not have been very useful even for this illegitimate purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.505" offset="8081429">Finally, we come to the problem of legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.866" offset="8098879">Hereto, the record is completely bare.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.391" offset="8112985">The decision of the court below and that is in both opinions didn't really consider the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.060" offset="8135659">Indeed, if you read those opinions, it would seem to have adopted a view which was directly repudiated by this Court in Watkins that the inquiry was an end in itself, but merely that fact that -- and perhaps, I think they adopted a view which we -- will be put by the quotation I read from Mr. Hitz.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.055" offset="8215594">That once they had information that the petitioner was a member of the Communist Party, they had a right to demand the records of the union and one may not go beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.701" offset="8254151">In other words, the inquiry serves its all purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.415" offset="8265017">It need not have a legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.720" offset="8278288">The Government here on appeal, and I think for the first time in the Supreme Court -- well I think it did raise it earlier in -- it's opposition to the petition for certiorari comes forth with a number of hypothetical suggestions as to what conceivably might have been of the legislative purpose of the committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.341" offset="8360730">We have treated that in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.802" offset="8370552">I do not think I have the time to go into them in full detail here except to say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.981" offset="8391346">One, they are afterthoughts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.362" offset="8400854">Two, they are hypothetical suppositions as to what the committee might have had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.657" offset="8426036">They are clearly farfetched and fanciful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.789" offset="8438575">And most importantly, in no case does the Government establish a nexus between a list of 35,000 union members in any of these purported legislative purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.888" offset="8490924">I want to comment just briefly on one suggested legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.645" offset="8509942">It appears in the Government's brief at page 42.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.857" offset="8522794">And that is that the Subcommittee here might have been interested in determining whether or not the union was a communist front organization as defined by the Internal Security Act of 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.188" offset="8584129">We would contend that if that had been the purpose of the committee, it would have form squarely upward of the language of this Court both in Quinn and in Watkins that legislative committees are not law enforcement agencies, nor trial agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.728" offset="8650271">The function of determining whether any organization is a communist front organization is committed by the Internal Security Act to the subversive activities controller -- Subversive Activities Control Board subject to judicial review.</text>

            <text syncTime="2803.079" offset="11315702">We say here that there is absolutely no showing at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.361" offset="11328867">There was none in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.491" offset="11337331">There was none at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.844" offset="11342764">The only thing that is presented here is the argument of the Government which I can only characterize as fanciful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.206" offset="11372231">That the Subcommittee might have been interested in doing something about that section of the Constitution which guarantees to the State, every state in the union a Republican form of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.697" offset="11422177">The Government however, does not carry that contention to the point of trying to establish a nexus between these lists of names in that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.303" offset="11468570">I want to turn out briefly to our contention that in any event, a judgment of acquittal should be -- be enacted because of the failure to inform the petitioner of the pertinency of these records as required by Watkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.720" offset="11546206">The Government concedes here that nothing was said at the hearing which would satisfy this requirement, nothing at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.131" offset="11583927">It contends however as did the court below that it was not necessary to satisfy this requirement for three separate reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.994" offset="11619349">One, that the subject was indisputably clear from the tenor of the proceedings in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.627" offset="11649860">Two, it argues that petitioner did not adequately raise the issue with pertinency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.571" offset="11673684">And three, in any event, the petitioner was well aware of both the subject of inquiry and the pertinency of the list.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.450" offset="11709210">I think so far as the first subject is concerned, that everything was so clear, but nothing need be said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.672" offset="11730108">I've already addressed myself sufficiently on that point and need not go into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.648" offset="11749961">On the second point, the argument that the petitioner did not adequately raise the objection of pertinency, I'd like to look at the record on that and indicate what was it that the petitioner did say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.789" offset="11818506">Now, he said, first, that he thought that the list was being asked for -- for blacklisted purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2970.808" offset="11986631">He said that the subpoena was a wholesale invasion of privacy and violated the Fourth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.508" offset="12013380">In that connection, the Government makes a curious contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.237" offset="12024351">It says that the petitioner's reliance on the Fourth Amendment was that in fact a -- made omission of pertinency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.576" offset="12057684">I must say it's always been my contention that my understanding that the Fourth Amendment is the constitutional provision of protecting individual against the demand for irrelevant documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.768" offset="12106480">And therefore it seems to me that if he was required to use autistic terms, he certainly did it when he placed his objection on the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.211" offset="12148172">He said also that he thought the list was being used for blacklisting purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.586" offset="12169697">He was cut off in the middle of an objection in which he said that he thought the demand infringed here on an area which just crosses the boundaries of individual rights as well as trade union rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.989" offset="12223300">At that point, it was Senator Watkins who said, "I don't care what your argument is."</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.498" offset="12245347">He had also said, when he said he thought it would be a blacklisting purpose, Senator Watkins said that, "Well, this is an executive session.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.439" offset="12281083">We can keep this private."</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.656" offset="12285994">He said at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.218" offset="12292263">"Why don't you keep it private?</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.449" offset="12297174">I don't see how it would be relevant to any purpose even to the illegitimate purpose of blacklisting."</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.206" offset="12324237">Now, I contend, I don't see how a witness could more clearly state his objection to lack of pertinency than the witness has done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.175" offset="12364048">We must remember that the witness is after all are not lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.838" offset="12378676">There were some discussions here about the fact that witnesses do have counsel in these proceedings and the witness did have counsel in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.911" offset="12419009">I'd like to just talk about that for one minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.438" offset="12433115">In these proceedings the role of counsel is limited to advising the witness by a sort of whispering and the witness is here as things come up as to what the witness might say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.646" offset="12485987">Counsel does not have the privilege and counsel is not permitted as a matter of fact to make objections on behalf of the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.838" offset="12522768">It seems to me that under those circumstances, to expect that what the witness is going to say is going to come out in the most precise legal terms or that they are required to come out in the most precise legal terms is more than hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.257" offset="12588387">And I say under any stand and even if hypothetical standard, the petitioner here clearly objected to the pertinency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.975" offset="12623287">And therefore -- he was under Watkins entitled to be informed as to what the pertinency was.Finally the Government adapting the reasoning of the court below said that it was not necessary to inform petitioner of the pertinent subject under of inquiry of pertinency because he knew it any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.096" offset="12703744">On that, I do not want to risk, to paraphrase the reasoning of the court below, I don't think I can.I think I would like to read it to indicate what Judge Prettyman said on that score in the second opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.485" offset="12761318">I'm reading now from page 34 of my brief quoting from the record at 117.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.959" offset="12787231">Judge Prettyman said, "Even if the resolution is vague, Flaxer's responses to questions demonstrated that he knew what the subject of the inquiry was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.694" offset="12830177">In response to the subpoena, he produced the financial and various other records of his union and without objecting, presented them to the committee on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.344" offset="12872704">He thus indicated that he recognized the nature of the question under inquiry."</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.266" offset="12896423">Now, I would submit that this passage just doesn't have any semblance of logic whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.910" offset="12918993">The fact that the petitioner has no objection to presenting the financial records of the unions certainly doesn't indicate knowledge of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.083" offset="12955669">And even if they did have knowledge as to the financial records of the union being pertinent to something, I don't see how you could follow from that or draw from that the inference that he knew the pertinency of the membership list.</text>

            <text syncTime="4393.300" offset="17676622">I would like to interpolate, I think he is not correct in that even it would be unlawful or prohibited or an unfair labor practice for him to have been required to produce to an industrial employer in a private industry, the membership lists because it has been held that it is not an unfair practice per se for an employer to inquire of the membership of a union.</text>

            <text syncTime="5657.322" offset="22732675">My answer to that is very likely we would not, because there would have been some bit of futility in doing so and the committee would have had the material.</text>

            <text syncTime="5742.053" offset="23071535">First, the witness cannot enforce upon the tribunal a purge.</text>
            <text syncTime="5750.151" offset="23103927">A purge that is a later a compliance after a refusal which amounts to a contempt has to be accepted by the tribunal in order to be a purge and that was decided by this Court in the Norris case.</text>

            <text syncTime="5766.300" offset="23168606">In addition to that however, the -- I think Your Honor or I think perhaps I should stress again that there has been no misconception given to the witness when he's on the stand by the demeanor of the committee or anything that was said by its chairman which led to the complacency of the witness which might have resulted in his failure to comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="5799.396" offset="23300995">In other words, the situation is not one where there is a refusal to answer and the capability of answering.</text>
            <text syncTime="5806.610" offset="23329834">In other words, there has been no lulling into complacency that the objection has been sustained or that for some reason the tribunal has changed its mind and that witness, this witness Mr. Flaxer, was not capable of complying with this subpoena at the -- on the fifth of October when he was before the committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5828.563" offset="23417605">And he had rendered himself incapable of it.</text>
