            <label>Mr. Clifford J. Hynning</label>
            <text syncTime="15.934" offset="167058">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.476" offset="173328">Please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.433" offset="181060">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.636" offset="209899">It involves a former governmental employee, an educational employee of the Department of Interior who was removed in 1954 as a security risk from a position, which the government concedes, was non-insensitive, this is, this case doesn't involve any issue of secrets information, confidential information or anything of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.708" offset="318255">The suit was instituted in the summer of 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.001" offset="347408">It was heard on cross motions for summary judgment in the District Court, which granted the summary motion for the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.172" offset="384084">Then it went up to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.626" offset="401847">Now it is our contention here that the firing of this governmental employee from a non-sensitive position has a security risk and under the purported authority of a security order in the security act, it was unlawful under the decision of this court in Cole versus Young.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.285" offset="480528">And that he was therefore entitled to reinstatement as a result of a fact that his firing was unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.906" offset="518980">Now we are asked -- we asked in the District Court for both an order expunging the record and declaring the firing to be unlawful and for reinstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.103" offset="567777">We achieved part of that through a so-called voluntary expunging of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.261" offset="588466">The issue here is whether the firing was so unlawful that he was entitled to -- is entitled to reinstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.573" offset="621693">Now turning to the facts --</text>

            <text syncTime="131.863" offset="630784">(Inaudible)</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="clifford_j_hynning" startTime="134.404" stopTime="514.333">
            <label>Mr. Clifford J. Hynning</label>
            <text syncTime="134.404" offset="641024">That is correct, at the time of his removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.020" offset="651473">Now there are certain changes that have occurred in the personnel policy of the Department of Interior that I am going to allude to later which somewhat modifies the answer to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.975" offset="699225">I think it's necessary here to recall a little bit of the political atmosphere of 1954 when this security board -- when he was suspended and when he had his hearing before the security board.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.253" offset="752410">This was at a time prior to the decisions of this Court in Peters, in Service and Cole and there was a common assumption within the government that at a security hearing there were no legal problems or constitutional problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.160" offset="816044">That appeared to be the result of the decision of this Court in Bailey against Richardson which had been affirmed by an equal division.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.945" offset="859199">Now Vitarelli, as I said, was a teacher, an educational employee of the Office of Trust Territories of the Department of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.825" offset="898696">He was employed to train native teachers out in the Caroline Islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.621" offset="921893">Now these Caroline Islands are islands being administered by the United States in trust for the United Nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.856" offset="954807">They were the islands that were previously administered by Japan as mandated islands under the League of Nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.146" offset="983960">Now this case started initially with a newspaper interview with a high commissioner of the trust territories of the pacific, and this was printed in a Guam newspaper of March 13, 1954 and it's been reproduced as Pages 1 and 2 of the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.612" offset="1085837">The headline here was that it was going to be a security probe in the trust isles and that five employees were to be ousted as bad risks or asked to resign.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.923" offset="1135052">And an example was given of a known conscientious objector where the high commissioner stated that an advocate of pacifism is out of place and so sensitive and strategic in area as the trust territories.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.931" offset="1199104">I think this is a little ironic to find the high commissioner of trust territories believing that pacifist is out of place in some islands being administered by the United States in trust for the World Peace Organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.156" offset="1267963">A few days later he received a cable from the Secretary of the Interior advising him that he was being suspended without stating any of the charges on which he was being suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.282" offset="1320521">I assume that this was in the interest of economy, he was going to receive letter a little later stating the charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.970" offset="1351241">That came about a week later and it's been reproduced in the record on pages 3 through 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.691" offset="1386141">Now these charges allege that in the years from 1941 to 1945 he was either a member of or affiliated with one sympathetic association with the Communist Party, with members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.920" offset="1451029">And then he went -- they went to list that he was in association with certain named individuals that in 1945 he had registered a preference for the American Labor Party that while an instructor at Columbia University, he had subscribed to the USSR information bulletin and had purchased copies of the Daily Worker and the New Masses.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.997" offset="1555310">That in a previous answer to, under the Truman Loyalty Program, he had stated that his association with these named individuals were casual and it was asserted that this was not true, that his associations were those of an intimate friendship.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.383" offset="1632946">It then went on to allege that he was therefore not reliable or trustworthy in view of these facts and that he had deliberately misrepresented falsified or admitted material facts or he might be subject to coercion, influence or pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.388" offset="1704939">He was also notified that he was entitled to a hearing under the security order and he was supplied with a copy of the executive order under departmental security regulations as well as the Act of 1950, the Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.091" offset="1775783">At that time, he was given the alternative of returning to Washington at his own expense from half way around the world, try to answer these charges or if he wanted to bring his family back at government expense, he could resign.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.848" offset="1842761">He then tried to see how he could raise the funds to travel, but fortunately the government somehow or other was induced to change its mind and gave him a travel request so he could proceed to Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.784" offset="1890513">At this time, of course, he was suspended without pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.636" offset="1905873">He arrived here and prepared an answer together with approximately 44 affidavits principally from his associates on the job out in the trust territories.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.259" offset="1944430">In this answer, he denied any sympathy -- membership in or sympathy with the Communist Party or anyone who was a Communist, but he was informed that his answer was insufficient and therefore a hearing was scheduled.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.102" offset="2003780">He appeared at this hearing with counsel together with four witnesses, live witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.840" offset="2030738">The only live witnesses at this hearing were the petitioner and his four witnesses in support of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.836" offset="2062712">One of them was the very distinguished author James Michener, who wrote the Tales of the South Pacific who had been instrumental for Vitarelli's employment in the Office of Trust Territories.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.615" offset="2113808">As I said, the government presented no evidence of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.831" offset="2134706">He was asked a great variety of questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.820" offset="2150693">Now these, the nature of these questions are of the --</text>

            <text syncTime="774.338" offset="3200711">Now these questions have been -- the security officer at that time was the assistant solicitor of the Department of Interior Mr. Reuel Armstrong, who since became solicitor, but I believe has left the government service.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.665" offset="3269987">Now that was the nature of the hearing that he had and of course the problem that confronted his then counsel was what were the issues in this proceeding, were this -- were they charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.984" offset="3359326">They stated at the hearing his loyalty was not in question, and then they went over this whole area of political opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.368" offset="3388792">I might say political partisan opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.307" offset="3408645">Now a little later the Hearing Board recommended that his retention in employment was not in the interest of the national security and that recommendation was endorsed by the Secretary of the Interior, who said that as a result thereof, the employment of Vitarelli was to be terminated for the reasons specifically set forth in the letter of charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.941" offset="3531107">Now the letter of charges I have summarized to you and since it was conceded at the hearing, that he was entirely loyal, it would appear that by a process of elimination, the question was one of veracity that somehow or other he was not deemed a person who had fully told the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.525" offset="3613445">Now I do not know this, I don't know what -- why he was terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.248" offset="3632358">I can only go by the documents and analyze what appears in the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.669" offset="3654092">But I believe that when you have looked at several of these transcripts in here, you find -- tend to find a pattern on the part of the security machinery that can be described only as an obsession with veracity.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.006" offset="3707382">That is you are charged with something that isn't perhaps too important, but if you don't admitted and come clean in someway other, we know you are lying, we are going to get you on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.273" offset="3744475">Now I think that is the explanation of what the Hearing Board did, but it's entirely a deduction or a speculation on my part.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.678" offset="3778121">All that I can see in the record is that the Secretary of the Interior said that his employment should be terminated in the interest of national security for the reasons specifically set forth in the charges, and most of those charges seem to disappear if you assume that he is perfectly loyal.</text>

            <text syncTime="971.007" offset="3987414">Now the next stage, in this proceeding came up along approximately a year later, and if it were to be written up in fiction, it would be challenged I assume by many reviewers on the ground that it involves too many coincidences.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.722" offset="4050213">But Viterelli's counsel was taking a trip around the world, and while he was waiting at the airport out in India, he ran into a person who said he was a personnel officer of the Officer of Trust Territories of the Department of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.756" offset="4130356">So his counsel introduced himself and said that he had been attorney for Viterelli.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.643" offset="4157942">Now the personnel officer said well that was a case that should have been handled differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.049" offset="4183542">Now this is alleged in our complaint that Viterelli should -- wasn't a person of doubtful loyalty of security, he just didn't have common sense, because he associated with the natives.</text>

            <text syncTime="1034.817" offset="4242683">Out in the -- he was supposed to train native teachers in the Caroline Islands, but he permitted his children to associate with native children and this reflected a lack of common sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.523" offset="4289494">Well his counsel represented these facts to the Secretary of the Interior, and on the occasion of the personnel officer's return to the United States, a supplemental hearing was held in which all of this was testified to under oath by the personnel officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.627" offset="4361906">So at this second hearing, Viterelli did have a witness on behalf of the government come in and more or less confirm what his counsel had represented had transpired there at that airport in India.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.987" offset="4427316">Well this was the posture of the situation, of the case, the time this Court decided Cole versus Young.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.873" offset="4466813">Whereupon a demand was made on the Secretary of the Interior for immediate reinstatement on the ground that he held a non-sensitive position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.340" offset="4512684">When that demand was not complied with, the suit went into the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.971" offset="4535254">Now at that time, the government came up with the defense that in as much as Viterelli had held a position called Schedule A, that is one of the scheduled accepted from the competitive civil service under the Lloyd-La Follette Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.921" offset="4615084">He could be fired for no reason at all and therefore he had no right to -- right of reinstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.503" offset="4649357">At that point, we served a notice for the taking of depositions on the Secretary of the Interior and the respondent members of Civil Service Commission to inquire of why they insisted on firing him with a badge of infamy as a security reason when he could have been fired for no reason at all, without any infamy, without damage to his profession and career.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.051" offset="4759594">The government opposed this discovery on the ground that these questions were hypothetical and immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.547" offset="4789582">I am now reading from page 11 of the brief, “the only relevant legal issue herein is whether the procedures in fact employed by the defendant's secretary in accomplishing plaintiff's discharged were legal and valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.335" offset="4852694">Neither the existence of any other procedure which could have been used to discharge plaintiff, nor the reason why it was not in fact employed can have any possible relevance therein.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.075" offset="4899715">Noting this as a concession of record, we abandoned the effort of discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.213" offset="4932211">Now the district judge, the -- the next step then was the voluntary expunging of the record by respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.830" offset="4978709">They stated that a new personnel form had been issued which struck from it all references to the executive order into the Act of 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.808" offset="5026565">And stated that that was the maximum relief to which this petitioner was entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.435" offset="5057076">Now the district judge felt that since Vitarelli was not in the competitive civil service and was therefore an employee at will, he could not order him reinstated since the government -- since the employing department could turn around that same day and fire him for no reason at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.416" offset="5149027">Now in the Court of Appeals we argued the constitutional issue that the -- while Vitarelli could have been dismissed as an employee at will, he was not so dismissed, he was dismissed as a security risk under a legal authority which was not applicable thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.265" offset="5228440">Now the manner of his dismissal was defamatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.713" offset="5242232">It started with a newspaper conference on Guam and it went on from there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.364" offset="5264802">It defamed him in his right to follow his calling as a teacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.514" offset="5285386">Now the Court of Appeals held that there was a modicum or a minimum of constitutional rights available to an employee such as Vitarelli.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.300" offset="5328541">He had a right to be free from dismissal on unconstitutional or flagrantly arbitrary grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.018" offset="5351424">But that no such dismissal had occurred here, but the treatment was not arbitrary and was consistent with due process referring to the fact that he has charges, there was the paraphernalia of a hearing and review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.313" offset="5404609">Furthermore the Court of Appeals had held that even these things aside, there was a clear basis for the executive to have fired Vitarelli on the ground that he was untrustworthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.229" offset="5452257">And they recited here at this paragraph of the letter of charges which said that he was untrustworthy or alleged that he was untrustworthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.889" offset="5490918">The Court of Appeals further held that he had gotten the maximum relief that he would be entitled to under any circumstances namely an expunging of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.455" offset="5529161">Now this expunging of the record is a rather interesting thing in this case, the government recited that they have expunged all references to any adverse findings made with respect to Vitarelli under the security order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.727" offset="5610245">So that means that the letters making a finding that his removal was required by the interest of national security, that's out, and for the reason specifically set forth in letter of charges, he look -- he must then look at the letter of charges to see what remains after the expunging takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.681" offset="5686105">Now the subject matter is suspension under the executive order, that's out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.551" offset="5705540">Next paragraph says by authority of the executive order you are suspended, so that's out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.874" offset="5730826">The next paragraph, number two says a specific -- a specific of security interest permits your charge as follows, so that's out, that's under the executive order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.262" offset="5768443">Then you get down to paragraph number three which says your behavior et cetera show you to be unreliable in the light of the facts above alleged that's out, because it refers obviously to the facts above alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.200" offset="5820165">Moreover the language of numbered paragraph 3 is paradigm from the criteria for security dismissal under the executive order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.637" offset="5865932">Now in the next paragraph number four, there is your advice of your rights to have a hearing under the executive order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.743" offset="5890382">So that's out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.153" offset="5896025">The last paragraph says you get a copy of the executive order, well that's out.</text>

            <text syncTime="1474.610" offset="6001768">I think that's all that remains under that expunging.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.241" offset="6052342">Now the basic contention that remains here I think is that the constitutional rights of an employee such as Vitarelli are coterminous with the rights given to him by Congress and if Congress has given him no rights, he has no constitutional rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="2516.439" offset="10169135">They then go on to say that, in such a case, where they -- where an employee is being removed on security ground, he is entitled to a written statement of charges, and I am now reading from the regulation, “as specific and detailed as security considerations permit.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.888" offset="10254921">Now we come to the charges to see whether it meets that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.707" offset="10270177">The charges, in view of the concession that is loyalty was not in issue, gets down to a charge of veracity, and that charge of veracity is that he had stated that his associations with three named individuals were not casual, but were on the contrary associations of an intimate friendship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.216" offset="10364217">Now I submit that you test whether or not a charge is specific by trying to determine whether you can answer the charge on the assumption of innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.891" offset="10406954">Of course, if you assume the man is guilty there isn't any point of this inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.680" offset="10422105">But if the assumption of innocence is applicable, then a charge that the man has said his relationship was casual, how can he answer that in terms of something that didn't occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.104" offset="10475813">I mean if -- if his sole association was casual, that's all it is, how can he answer something more that it was one of intimate friendship without telling him times, places and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.618" offset="10525863">We submit that that weighting of the charge doesn't meet the test of specificity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.526" offset="10553448">It's I think entirely subject to the criticism of this Court in Simmons against the United States of a game of blind man's bluff.</text>

            <text syncTime="2710.789" offset="10946539">In accordance with this Court's decision in Cole v. Young, we concede here as we have conceded in the courts below that petitioner's removal from federal employment was not authorized by the act of August 26th, 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.194" offset="11024175">Consistent with that concession, the Civil Service Commission has expunged from its records all adverse findings relating to petitioner that were taken in accordance with Executive Order 10450.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.741" offset="11102333">The Department of Interior likewise consistent with that -- this concession has similarly expunged its personnel records with respect to Mr. Viteralli of all implications that his removal from government service was pursuant to the act of August 26 to the executive order and to the departmental order and there is no basis upon his -- from his personnel record from which anyone could infer that Mr. Viteralli is or was a security risk, whether that was the reason or is the reason for his separation from government service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.542" offset="11285504">This administrative relief, which has been accorded to the petitioner is a substantial compliance with the -- one of the prior for relief that he sought in his complaint filed in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.905" offset="11346944">In addition, however, he asked that his removal in 1954 be declared invalid, and that he -- that the courts direct that he be reinstated to his former position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.431" offset="11409115">These are the two issues, which are involved in this case as we view it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.940" offset="11447150">The question of whether or not his removal was invalid must we think be disassociated from the question of whether or not the authority relied upon by the Secretary of Interior was erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.022" offset="11511411">We concede of course that the authority far fell with the decision in Cole v. Young, but it does not follow because the Secretary's authority that he relied upon has fallen that the removal is necessarily invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.599" offset="11581733">We are concerned here with an employee who is not a veteran, who was not in the classified civil service, as such his employment was without fixed tenure, and he was at all times subject to removal for cause or for no cause or for a reason and without assignment of reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="3064.422" offset="12361017">The validity of his removal must we think be said in the light of the traditional role that the courts have played where employee removals are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.106" offset="12403754">This of course, now this case involves a removal by the executive which had, what it was, without any limitations as to your procedural or substantive -- of a substantive character.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.051" offset="12475538">Now for a 170 years the inquiry of the courts has been as to whether or not the removal has been effective in compliance with the procedural limitations that had been imposed upon the employment either by Congress or by regulation or by executive order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.792" offset="12562578">That is perhaps open to another limitation that being whether or not the removal was effective for some patently arbitrary or discriminatory reason.</text>
