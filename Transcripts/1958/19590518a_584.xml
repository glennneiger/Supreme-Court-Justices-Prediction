            <label>Mr. Samuel S. Mitchell</label>
            <text syncTime="20.349" offset="184717">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.994" offset="191300">This is an appeal from the Supreme Court of North Carolina in case of Louise Lassiter versus Northampton County Board of Elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.195" offset="240201">The opinion below was an affirmance of the judgment of the Superior Court of Northampton County which had in turn affirmed the decision of the County Board of Election which had in turn affirmed the decision of Registrar of the C-Board precinct in denying to the appellant the right to register as a voter.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.210" offset="368201">Now the facts of this case are found for the most part in the stipulations that counsel entered into in the Superior Court, by which they submitted to Court the case to the judge without the intervention of the jury, for decision upon about 21 findings of -- of 21 stipulations as to what the facts were.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.568" offset="481677">The facts indicate that the appellant had gone before the registrar of the C-Board precinct on the 22nd day of June 1957 and asked for registration as a voter.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.990" offset="555342">The registrar offered to give the appellant a literacy test which the registrar insisted she was required by law to give to all applicants for registration and the appellant declined to take the literacy test contenting that the literacy was unconstitutional by the rights that she had and which (Inaudible) to her by virtue of Fourteenth, Fifteenth and the Seventeenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.271" offset="688462">From the registrar's denial on 22nd day of June 1957 to appellant of the right to register, the appellant took the appeal provided by the statute which is North Carolina General Statute 163-28 to the Board of Elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.235" offset="760351">Board of Elections heard the appellant's appeal on the 28th day of June 1957 and also declined to register the appellant upon her failure to submit to the literacy test or at least to the educational test provided by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.498" offset="837360">From the decision of the Board of Elections the appellant found herself in the Superior Court where, as I have stated for the -- all of the facts boil down in 21, stipulations in which counsel entered into, which are found in record here as to what the facts of the case were.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.781" offset="938506">Now the -- prior to this proceeding which began with the registrar in the C-Board precinct in June, there had been a hearing and a trial by a three-judge district -- United States District Court and which opinion is reproduced I believe in the brief here of the -- the brief amicus curiae of the Attorney General and which it referred to in all of the briefs before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.482" offset="1077269">That case is called Lassiter versus Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.468" offset="1093256">In that case the Court had ruled that where the appellant who is the same appellant before this Court, had said that and had claimed that the constitutional provisions of North Carolina provided for the educational test and statutes provided by the educational test were offensive to the rights under the Constitution of the United States, that the section of the constitution involve which is Section 6 -- Section 4 of Article 6 of the Constitution of the United States was unconstitutional when written, when enacted, and of course it was enacted in 1902.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.303" offset="1272560">Now the Court provided in that judgment that it was stayed in a further investigation as to the matter or any further inquiry into the case until plaintiff had gone into the state court to get an interpretation upon some new state laws that had been written while that action was pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.932" offset="1367124">One week before the district court sought to rule upon the matters which plaintiff had placed -- initiated in the district court pertaining to the constitutionality of the literacy test and the applicability of the same to her, the General Assembly of North Carolina had rewritten the statutes involved doing nothing to the constitution provision but had rewritten the statutes in which they had taken out certain language in statutes such as that an applicant for registration would have to satisfy the registrar as to his quantification, they had put in certain appeal mechanism and had provided that from the registrar's decision there would be appeals to the board and also the Superior Court of the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.555" offset="1593553">It was -- these administrative remedies that the federal court referred to when it said that it was stay execution or it would stay further proceeding in the case of Lassiter versus Taylor until the plaintiff had exhausted the administrative remedies provided under North Carolina General Statute 163-28 as revised and as rewritten just seven or eight days prior to the convenience of the Court to hear the case.</text>
