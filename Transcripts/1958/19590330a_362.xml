            <label>Mr. Lionel Kestenbaum</label>
            <text syncTime="28.592" offset="217736">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.614" offset="237798">This case involves a fraudulent misuse of veterans priority established under the Surplus Property Act of 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.672" offset="270085">In this Act, the Congress provided for the disposal of vast quantity of goods which would be left over at the end of the Second World War.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.138" offset="295894">The statutory objective included fair distribution of goods, avoidance of dislocation of the economy, discouragement of speculation, and encouragement of small business specifically aid to returning veterans was mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.391" offset="364962">By 1946 Amendment, veterans were given a priority second only to that of the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.114" offset="387845">And in addition to that, the veterans were given the exclusive right to acquire certain specific types and quantities of property which was set aside for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.032" offset="427551">These -- a lot of types and quantities and property could be acquired by veterans who desire to acquire them for their own personal use or for the establishment and maintenance of their own small business.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.823" offset="470706">Now, petitioners, Koller and Silverbrook were veterans who applied for and obtained these priority certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.019" offset="495470">They -- instead of using them for the purposes to which were intended and which were certified in their application, they sold them to a third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.173" offset="528071">Koller executed two fraudulent applications and this -- his certificates were used by the third party to purchase two trucks and one car.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.377" offset="564851">Silverbrook's certificate was used to purchase six busses and three trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.854" offset="586794">Both petitioners were indicted to these fraudulent acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.569" offset="597661">They pleaded guilty, and they each paid small fines.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.491" offset="617305">In the present case as Mr. Malis stated the third day, the Government has to enforce civil remedies provided by this Act, the Surplus Property Act of 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.786" offset="654503">Section 26 (b) sets forth three alternative measures of recovery and the first one was the one used here, $2000 for each fraudulent act and double damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.287" offset="696508">Summary judgment was granted against Koller for $4000, against Silverbrook for $2000.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.858" offset="718764">The petitioners' only defense was that the suit was barred by statute of limitations because it is not been brought within five years of the acts complained of.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.398" offset="757008">There's no statute of limitations in the Surplus Property Act itself, the -- one rely to parties, one contained in Title 28, Section 2462 imposing a five-year limitation upon suits for a civil fine, penalty or forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.229" offset="824299">The courts below -- both courts below relied upon the decision of this Court only three years ago, Rex Trailer Company versus United States and held that the recovery sought by the Government and obtained by the Government was not such as civil fine, penalty or forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.104" offset="887829">Now, the petitioners do not dispute that damage to the Government could be anticipated from violations of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.614" offset="913847">There's none for that matter that damage was actually sustained here.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.827" offset="926699">And I think the problem can be put in a perspective by examining the elements of damage which the Court set forth in Rex Trailer Company versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.070" offset="967659">First, the policy of the Congress concerning disposal of this property were frustrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.293" offset="996498">The fraud diverted the vehicles, these 12 vehicles from veterans or other priority claimants who were entitled to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.035" offset="1031502">Second, Mr. Justice Clark in Rex Trailer Company pointed out that there was a pecuniary loss suffered by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.019" offset="1067447">The sale on these priority certificates was at a much lower price than petitioners or anyone else could have paid -- could have paid for these vehicles on the open market.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.123" offset="1107884">So, the Government sold these vehicles for a price lower than their market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.149" offset="1127946">In addition, since the fraud decreased the number of vehicles available to government agencies, it may very well be -- it could be reasonably anticipated that a -- federal agencies would have to go out and buy the same vehicles because they have been obtained fraudulently by impeachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.958" offset="1203179">Third is the element of the unjust enrichment to the perpetuators of the fraud themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.236" offset="1224286">Mr. -- Mr. Justice Clark indicated these elements in the Rex Trailer case but the record there was not adequate to show its existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.004" offset="1255424">Here on the other hand, we have the admitted fact that the petitioners sold their certificates to this third party for a consideration, a consideration which undoubtedly reflected the difference between the market value of these vehicles and the price which the Government was wiling to take from veterans and veterans alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.249" offset="1324387">Fourth element, not mentioned by the Court in Rex Trailer but pointed out by the Third Circuit in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.184" offset="1348106">It's the element of the cause of investigation and litigation which Congress might have had in mind in setting up this measure of recovery in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.461" offset="1385200">Now, once these items of damage -- anticipated damage are set forth then it becomes clear that what we have here in 26 (b) (1) of the Surplus Property Act is a common legislative device.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.534" offset="1437550">To use the language in the Rex Trailer case is the fixing of a lump sum in damages in a situation where the actual damage maybe difficult or impossible to ascertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.654" offset="1477987">Now, the Court also said, it is the function of liquidated damages to provide a measure of recovery and just of circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.177" offset="1504110">The judgment for $2000 for each fraudulent act which was the one upheld in that case was held comparable to recovery under liquidated damage provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.375" offset="1540890">In the same way in Marcus versus Hess of 317 U.S., the almost identical civil remedy of the False Claims Act was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.975" offset="1575267">And the Court held there that the purpose and effect of this kind of recovery was to provide indemnity or restitution to the Government for -- for the fraud against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.941" offset="1615182">The device of double damages plus specific sum was chosen, the Court said, to assure that the Government would be made completely whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.852" offset="1646738">And the choice of such a sum, the discretion in fixing this kind of recovery to assure that the Government would be is whole the choice was up to Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="399.070" offset="1699610">Could you give an you give an example of what you see would be a civil penalty under the statute?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lionel Kestenbaum</label>
            <text syncTime="404.629" offset="1721866">Yes, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.069" offset="1727613">There are many such civil penalties in the U.S. code and there are many -- and there are a number of them which are exampled by cases under 2462 itself under the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.523" offset="1773484">The -- some prominent ones, I can give a few as an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.630" offset="1793860">If a railroad which violates -- which fail to comply with an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, would have to pay a certain penalty of the violation and certain number of dollars for each day during which this violation continues.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.050" offset="1847568">A farmer who sells a certain amount of his crop above his permissible marketing quota, is subject to a penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.660" offset="1886020">A few others, a ship owner who requires a seaman to work more than eight hours a day, pay a sentence of -- is subject for the payment of a certain sum.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.675" offset="1922069">This kind of penalty goes way back.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.427" offset="1929070">One of the earliest ones we have is a participation in a slave trade which could result in a forfeiture of vessel and the payment of certain sum.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.312" offset="1960626">I think the key to all these cases and each one of these situations, there was no transaction of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.943" offset="1983195">There was no possible foreseeable liability to the Government under any contract towards principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.966" offset="2007228">And so what we have in those situations, the Government is seeking to vindicate either a general public policy or the interest of a specific protected class like seaman or another situation, Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.731" offset="2066265">The statutes state that a person who surveyed Indian land illegally is subject to a penalty of $1000 which the Government can collect.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.129" offset="2103881">Now, this line has been indeed drawn under 2462.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.623" offset="2121853">The cases under 2462 recognize that a legislature -- the Congress or legislature of the states can establish measures of liquidated damages in a situation where it might be difficult or impossible to prove actual damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.342" offset="2188727">And in no such recovery whether it's double damages, treble damages or a fix sum, no such recovery has ever been held to constitute a penalty under this statute of limitations into full with in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.104" offset="2235747">The line was set forth by this Court I think quite clearly in Meeker versus Lehigh Valley Railroad, 236 United States, that where the statutory liability fix runs to readdress a private injury that is it runs in favor of the party who was injured or to whom injury was anticipated, then it cannot be a fine, a penalty or forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.042" offset="2327489">Hence, it's not covered by this limitations period.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.064" offset="2347656">I think -- I'd like to point out following that -- I think the error in the petitioner's position and the error in the one conflicting decision -- that of the Court of Claims is demonstrated by their assumption that double damages is necessarily a penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.633" offset="2409932">Under 2462, this Court has held explicitly that treble damages -- that treble damage is recoverable under the antitrust laws that those treble damages are -- do not constitute a penalty or a fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.443" offset="2461132">And hence, are not covered by these limitations period.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.173" offset="2472103">What they do constitute, they constitute a measure of recovery which a legislature sought to establish.</text>

            <text syncTime="615.382" offset="2564890">And the Court stated in Marcus versus Hess which I referred to just a moment ago that it is a -- that the device of these two together, double damages and $2000 to recheck was the device chosen by Congress to provide full restitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.868" offset="2622882">I think this case is an example of the fact that it's very difficult to prove double damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.687" offset="2638137">The Government did not seek to prove double damages, and the recovery here consist only this fix sum.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.840" offset="2662693">That's very often the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.543" offset="2669589">In Marcus versus Hess which is under the False Claims Act, there was a judgment for both elements together.</text>

            <text syncTime="688.229" offset="2856312">The ultimate question was different and that it concerned the application of Double Jeopardy Clause.But the rationality of these decisions is what is controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.059" offset="2895600">The rationality of these decisions is dispositive in this case for petitioners conceived that if this recovery can be characterized as liquidated damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="1224.597" offset="5001801">And that therefore, that settles the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.138" offset="5011937">As far as the intention of Congress is concerned, the Court stated it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.933" offset="5027088">The Court set it forth in Rex Trailer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.529" offset="5033462">I will just repeat these elements for a moment here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.310" offset="5048613">Congress, in the first place, copied Section 26 (b) (1) from the comparable provision of the False Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.552" offset="5077556">And this Court, just a year before the Surplus Property Act was passed, this Court had held the same recovery, $2000 for each act and double damages to constitute a compensatory civil remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.230" offset="5124263">As Mr. Justice Clark said in Rex Trailer, obviously, when Congress copied this language, it intended a similar compensatory device in this act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.083" offset="5163656">Second, Congress specifically designated the two alternative measures of recovery in 26 (b) as liquidated damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.412" offset="5196988">The petitioner's argue that that indicate some sort of distinction between subdivisions (2) and (3) and subdivision -- subdivision (1) which are set forth on page 3 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.588" offset="5241710">But I think the answer to that in the first place contained in Rex Trailer itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.804" offset="5262608">The Court said that each one of these three alternatives can be selected by the Government at its option and each was of the same nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.935" offset="5291133">If there has to be an explanation, I think the explanation lies in the chronology to which -- which I just referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.666" offset="5314017">Since this Court had already held 26 (b) (1) or its equivalent to constitute a measure of liquidated damages, the Congress began with it that it did not have to characterize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.069" offset="5355604">This Court has already done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.534" offset="5361560">And then added on these two alternative methods which the Government -- which the United States could allege and each one of those was characterized by the Congress as liquidated damages to assure that it will be treated the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.163" offset="5408057">Turning to the suspension provision to what Mr. Justice Stewart referred a moment ago, I think that no contrary implication of a congressional intent can be drawn from that suspension provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.766" offset="5458422">That a suspension applies to a number of statutes under which the government proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.077" offset="5483708">And even if it does cover also civil statute of limitations as well as criminal statutes, even if it does cover civil statute, even if it does hold civil statute of limitation, there is nothing to intimate -- there's nothing in its passage to intimate that Congress thought there was a civil statute which applied to the recovery in the Surplus Property Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.786" offset="5598542">The Third Circuit not only relied upon the rationale of this Court's decision in Marcus versus Hess and in Rex Trailer but it pointed out as I was stating a moment ago that certiorari had been granted in Rex Trailer to resolve a conflict between the Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.689" offset="5666147">And that's conflict, the conflict referred to was the conflict on this precise issue, the statute of limitation issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.949" offset="5695195">The Third Circuit said that it believe that the Court in deciding Rex Trailer must have resolve the very conflict to which it had referred in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.663" offset="5742007">And we submit that the Third Circuit was justified in reaching that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.551" offset="5765622">And the same conclusion had, as I indicated, been reached by every other court that has been faced with this problem other then the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.091" offset="5823718">As I already have indicted this conclusion below is demonstrated to be correct by the uniform interpretation of the statute of limitation itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.979" offset="5867290">Petitioners have cited various cases using the words penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.420" offset="5881083">But not only do they ignore the holdings of this Court in Rex Trailer and in the Marcus versus Hess but they also ignore this uniform interpretation of the statute of limitation itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.883" offset="5926954">This Act has been on the book since 1839 and -- and as I've stated, it has never been applied to a measure of recovery fixed by a legislature as a mode of liquidated damages to which an injured party can rely upon.</text>

            <text syncTime="1755.176" offset="7124093">May I, Mr. Justice Stewart, perhaps more actively answer your question, 56 Stat. 747 is the citation of the original suspension section enacted in 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.111" offset="7191803">In 58 Stat.649, this was enacted July 1st, 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.830" offset="7218657">Certain important language was changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.792" offset="7238510">The earlier statute clearly was a criminal suspension act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.977" offset="7255228">It applied to offenses indictable under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.673" offset="7274036">It's so stated when two years later in July 1st, 1944, the Contract Settlement Act in the law, the language offenses indictable was deleted and the statute was expanded to include acts, transactions and so on and applied to specifically the Contracts Settlement Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.307" offset="7376645">In 1954, in October, three months later, and in the same volume of the statute at large, 58 Stat. 765, the Surplus Property Act contained an amendment to this suspension of limitation section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.737" offset="7454281">That is Section 28 of the Surplus Property Act and I submit to this Court that --</text>

            <text syncTime="1864.212" offset="7560234">That is exactly correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.030" offset="7567444">And we submitted on our earlier portion of the argument that Section 28 is that suspension section relating to acts, transactions, and offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.514" offset="7609448">Not only offenses now indictable and that it follows by two sections, the subject 26 (b) (1) here on the consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.999" offset="7643408">We submit that the Congress definitely must have intended or assume that the provisions of the Surplus Property Act ant the Contract Settlement Act in each of which statutes, they took the trouble to enact suspension sections were bound by or governed by limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.644" offset="7734000">Otherwise, the presence of those suspension sections in that very act containing no criminal aspects of its own would be a rather unusual method of draftsmanship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.439" offset="7781125">Now, the Government assumes in their argument that we agree that these damages exist.We definitely do not agree on any such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.458" offset="7821249">There is nothing in this record at all which relates to damages to a program or damages in any other sort other than the offenses complained of were committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.185" offset="7872136">As a matter of fact, the super priority which is referred to by the Government was not enacted until two of the three acts complained about had already taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.005" offset="7915395">The super priority section as it's been referred to was enacted on May 3rd, 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.181" offset="7944129">And it gave the secretary the right to delegate or to separate certain of the surplus vehicles for the benefit of veterans if he so chose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.577" offset="7985716">However, the two acts, the first two acts have already occurred then.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.461" offset="8001181">There is no evidence whatever that any such delegation ever took place during the offenses complained off in this case, none whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.395" offset="8044962">We feel that there should be and there is a differentiation between a penalty as the language uses it and the purpose for which that is applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.175" offset="8096057">As Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out, the question of penalty may be applied in an international law sense where one state enforced the law of the state of another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.520" offset="8133465">It may be applied as to double jeopardy as it was in Rex Trailer and Marcus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.870" offset="8150810">It may very well be applied to determine whether a defendant be required to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.539" offset="8177560">Now, none of those issues have been before the Supreme Court of the United States as applied to the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.998" offset="8207339">It is true, and I am somewhat interested as to why, in Mr. Justice Clark's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.878" offset="8234924">He says, we took certiorari -- we granted certiorari because of asserted conflict and it wasn't until -- as read in the Government's brief that they -- they had joined in that request rather than opposing it as here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2055.788" offset="8326562">The issue involves double jeopardy and as we respectfully stated, I hope in our brief -- after merely -- a footnote reference to it -- the Court exclusively devoted itself to double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.460" offset="8385181">That's why we say, sir that we are here for the first time on the question of limitations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2084.303" offset="8440560">The previous cases is one which sets forth quite clearly that in the absence of any measure of damage or any proof of damage whatsoever, an interorum provision to be applied upon the occurrence of an event regardless of whether any actual damages sustained or not is a penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.341" offset="8536691">And the language in that case has been followed and it's the foundation for the law as we understand liquidated damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.991" offset="8591339">The final point that I think we should make regardless of all the cases cited by the Government, there is not one which contains a provision for $2000 or its ilk and a multiple or a fraction of provable damage in every case, Helvering and Mithcell, Huntington and Attrill all those cited in our briefs and in the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.475" offset="8713279">Nowhere is there a situation which says take $2000 and double or a half of the provable damage.</text>

            <text syncTime="2202.363" offset="8912854">Well, the Congress has clearly indicated the -- that 26 (b) (2) and (3) are liquidated damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.005" offset="8939395">They've so stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.604" offset="8945768">In our brief, we say that that determination is not before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.645" offset="8961964">When they add $2000 to a multiple, and the multiple -- you'll see, Your Honor pleases, the multiple stands for its foundation upon proof of actual damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.194" offset="9012120">And the jury returns the verdict the Government has been damaged for $1000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.476" offset="9029256">Then we doubled it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.146" offset="9035943">This is in a sense, compensatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.850" offset="9046810">It is smart money that Congress has said, “It is given to the person injured.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.925" offset="9071052">Here, however, the basic distinction and the damages lies in the accessibility of that $2000 forfeiture or stipend as the courts have referred with, irrespective of one nickel worth of damage or any proof of any damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.137" offset="9131969">Plus, when added to it, double the amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.848" offset="9146807">You see, this is really intended to enforce the policy to prevent to punish.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.494" offset="9173347">And it is this sort of thing that the Congress in enacting 2462 and referring back to Your Honor's opinions in Marcus and Hess said, “We may recover such a thing in a civil suit.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.255" offset="9228413">If this is the philosophy of the Court and the language which the Court uses to define this $2000 26 (b) (1) and then for hundred years, the Congress has failed to repeal the existing statute of limitations in the False Claims Act further indicating its satisfaction with it and the fact further that Congress in 1948 reenacted this 100-year-old statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.858" offset="9342830">These things are all in my mind, indicative of an intention and an understanding that 2462 regardless of what we call 26 (b) (1), whether we call it penalty or forfeiture or civil crime or compensatory, for the limited purpose of limitations as oppose to double jeopardy or international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.069" offset="9431646">But for the limited purpose of limitations, we urge that the Congress understood 2462 to full and rely upon and to govern such a suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.971" offset="9483264">All the Government had to do here, they had nine years legally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.575" offset="9501654">All they had to do here was to institute suit before the suspension section applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.553" offset="9521612">I -- I commend to Your Honors the case of McKenna versus Armour which was affirmed in 254 F.2d 90 and certiorari denied in this Court in 358 U.S. 834 this year -- 1958 in which that point of the suspension section applying to civil actions was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.265" offset="9624430">And so, we urge this Court to reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals solely on the ground that the Government started 10 years after they should have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.710" offset="9670196">Five years after the men were indicted and that they are bound by the statute of limitation.</text>
