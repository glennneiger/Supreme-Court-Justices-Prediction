            <text syncTime="58.520" offset="337481">The only guidance that they had is to what was under inquiry, what the purpose of the Commission's hearings at that time were, where the mandate itself coupled with a few general statements, which I will refer to later, made by the Chairman of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.244" offset="396309">The Chairman of the Commission advised these witnesses that they had their privilege against self-incrimination available to them should the questions as -- seek incriminating -- incriminating information.</text>

            <text syncTime="157.596" offset="733706">In addition, Mr. Justice Douglas, throughout the colloquies or the questioning the -- it's implied in -- in much of the discussion between the witnesses and the Commission members that the privilege against self-incrimination was available.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.004" offset="791385">For instance, questions were asked as to whether or not that did really seek incriminating information or how would it incriminate the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.482" offset="817298">There was no doubt and it can't be argued, as a matter of fact, the Supreme Court of Ohio in its decision in this case stated that the Chairman of the -- of the Commission had obviously in its opinion misstated the law and there is no question here, but that the facts of the case are -- are clear that these witnesses were advised clearly and unequivocally and repeatedly that they had their privileges against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.625" offset="909876">And it might be further notice that to each of the questions for which these witnesses were indicted and which formed the counts in their indictments, they had asserted the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.722" offset="954284">And in all but one instance, that privilege had been automatically accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.689" offset="974137">There was no countermanding order saying that the -- the Commission itself rejected the assertion of the privilege or refused to accept the assertion of the privilege ordered and answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.520" offset="1013426">In only one of the questions which formed the three indictments was there a specific and direct order by the Commission to answer the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.346" offset="1048743">The trial was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.155" offset="1051982">The jury was waived even at the -- at the early -- earliest opportunity on the motions to cross the indictments.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.043" offset="1075493">The constitutional issues that are now before this Court were raised by the appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.287" offset="1096495">The trial judge found the appellants guilty on all accounts and found in -- in effect in an oral opinion that the questions that formed the counts of the indictments did not seek incriminating information and therefore, the privilege against self-incrimination was not available and therefore, they were guilty of contempt of the Ohio Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.122" offset="1191894">The appellants then appealed to the Court of Appeals for the First District of Ohio, which Court of Appeals reaffirmed the position of the trial court in stating that the questions had not sought incriminating information and therefore, the privilege against self-incrimination was not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.678" offset="1258036">But the Court of Appeals went on to make a further point that under the law, that under which these appellants were indicted, there was a requirement that a direction or order to answer be given the witnesses before the full act of contempt under the law is -- is completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.147" offset="1327940">And the Court of Appeals for the First District in Ohio found that when -- or -- or it found that such an order had impliedly been given when the question had been asked by a member of the Commission itself as distinguished from counsel for the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.133" offset="1391888">And so it reversed the convictions as to all counts which involved questions asked by the counsel of the Commission and affirmed as to all questions asked by the member of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.658" offset="1446013">The appeal is then taken to the Supreme Court of Ohio, which, for the first time in the proceedings, held that the Ohio immunity statute applied to these commission hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.136" offset="1495960">The Ohio immunity statute set out, of course, in -- in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.755" offset="1510379">And that since the -- since these witnesses were immune from prosecution as to any matter for which they might testify before the Commission, they therefore had no privilege against self-incrimination and therefore their assertions of the privilege against self-incrimination through the questions asked them by the Commission in which formed the counts of the indictment were acts of contempt and were willful defiances and where therefore -- they were therefore guilty and so --</text>

            <text syncTime="1500.861" offset="6106781">Unlike the appellant in the companion case here who was incited under the legislative contempt's Section, these witnesses were indicted under the judicial contempt section.</text>
