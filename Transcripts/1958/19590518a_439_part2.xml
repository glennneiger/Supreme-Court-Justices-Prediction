            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Mr. Illig you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. William F. Illig</label>
            <text syncTime="10.932" offset="147101">Mr. Chief Justice may I please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.011" offset="191404">The petitioner in this case seeks a reversal really on the basis of one decision of this Court, the case of Byrd versus the Blue Ridge Cooperative, in which the majority opinion was written by Mr. Justice Brennan last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.010" offset="255457">And I just like to take a half a second to show that the Bryd case was completely different from this in the whole situation so that there won't be any confusion in the Court's mind, because in the first place in the Byrd case the only evidence of statutory employment, which was the issue there, was presented on behalf of the defendant and all of it was withdrawn from the consideration of the jury, and the Court of Appeals decided as a matter of law that the plaintiff was a statutory employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.880" offset="378859">Here on the other hand, all of the evidence of petitioner's emergency employment was brought out by petitioner as part of his own case and it was not only all submitted to the jury, but it was submitted in the form of a special interrogatory presented by the court, which the jury answered in the affirmative and the Court of Appeals said, in the words of Judge Goodrich, “Thus the matter turns in the final analysis on a question of fact, that is a sufficient state of emergency to justify the enlisting of another to help assist in the business to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.858" offset="530787">The jury's finding is a forthright answer to a forthright question.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.604" offset="549804">The trial judge who heard all the testimony was satisfied -- satisfied with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.036" offset="571538">We do not think on this state of the record that we would be justified in setting it aside.”</text>
            <text syncTime="123.239" offset="596302">And the Court of Appeals in our case adopted the jury's finding of fact and applied applicable principles of Pennsylvania law and held that petitioner's remedies were in workmen's compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.626" offset="649906">Now it's been said that the whole defense of workmen's compensation was an affirmative defense of the defendant, but I think and I believe you will agree when you study the whole record, that a very peculiar situation developed in this case, which was responsible for petitioner developing the whole matter of the emergency employment and not as in the Byrd case, where the defendant sought to show that the plaintiff was a statutory employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.406" offset="760978">When you see the complaint you will find that it was not drawn in the terse federal notice type of pleading, but instead it was in a the detailed form followed under Pennsylvania practice and there it was alleged simply that Ormsbee the decedent was a guest passenger of the defendant invited to ride by Schroyer the driver.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.054" offset="847600">There was no reference to willful or wanton conduct, there was no word about emergency hiring, but at pretrial for the first time the petitioner became aware that workmen's compensation was going to come into this case, you will find that mentioned at page 11 of the pretrial notes, and petitioner also became aware that if he were merely an invitee of the driver or a guest passenger, he would be a trespasser as to the defendant Aetna Freight Lines for this reason.</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="214.380" offset="960867">May I ask you a question, you said page 11 of the pretrial?</text>

            <text syncTime="218.286" offset="976541">So that is page 11 --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_f_illig" startTime="220.045" stopTime="319.172">
            <label>Mr. William F. Illig</label>
            <text syncTime="220.045" offset="983542">No I beg your pardon Your Honor that is not printed in the record there.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.684" offset="998066">The pretrial notes I simply said that's were workmen's compensation first came into the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.941" offset="1027114">So what I was going to say was, he knew he would be a trespasser as to the defendant Aetna for this reason and this is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.800" offset="1062536">Schroyer the driver, and I think it's already been commented upon by Mr. Schneider, had been forbidden to take any rides.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.516" offset="1093465">There was a no rider sign on the windshield of the truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.405" offset="1109034">The ICC regulations forbade riders under those circumstances, therefore if he was a simply rider or guest passenger of the driver, he would be a trespasser as to Aetna and he couldn't recover on the basis of ordinary negligence, but would have to show willful or wanton misconduct, which under Pennsylvania law means a conscious disregard of known danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.926" offset="1207045">So the petitioner tried his case on two new theories, and I'm bringing this out not because there was any objection to it on the behalf of the respondent at the trial, but to give the background.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.397" offset="1248946">First, that if Ormsbee the decedent were a trespasser, the defendant Aetna was guilty of willful or wanton misconduct even though that hadn't been alleged in the complaint, but it had been brought out at the pretrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.206" offset="1300146">Secondly and more important Ormsbee was an emergency employee of the defendant Aetna.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.452" offset="1333164">Now, this is important too.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.137" offset="1339956">At that time the petitioner thought he was on perfectly safe ground in bringing the matter of emergency employment into the case as part of his own proof.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="319.172" stopTime="324.659">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="319.172" offset="1380080">(Inaudible)</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_f_illig" startTime="324.659" stopTime="489.889">
            <label>Mr. William F. Illig</label>
            <text syncTime="324.659" offset="1402023">There was, they found there was wanton misconduct on the part of the defendant, although the Court of Appeals did not find it necessary to meet that point because of the disposition on the first, because we had contended that there wasn't sufficient evidence of wanton misconduct here to have submitted the issue to the jury under established Pennsylvania law, since there wasn't any showing of a known disregard or conscious disregard of known danger, it was simply a matter of defective brakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.753" offset="1530337">So as I say, they proceeded to show emergency employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.706" offset="1554160">For this reason they thought they were safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.474" offset="1565236">That the petitioner or rather Ormsbee could not be a statutory employee of the defendant Aetna under Pennsylvania law because the accident didn't occur on the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.115" offset="1611839">But as Judge Goodrich pointed out in his opinion, what petitioner overlooked was Section 104 of the Pennsylvania Workmen's Compensation Act, whereby emergency employees are included within the definition of employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.445" offset="1669204">So then the petitioner proceeded to develop all of the facts surrounding how Ormsbee came to be on the truck instead of simply showing that an accident happened, the truck went over the embankment and both men were killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.380" offset="1716851">He showed that Ormsbee was hired for $25 by Schroyer as an assistant to help him in the performance of his duties which he was unable to perform for the balance of the trip.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.904" offset="1770977">The emergency was that Schroyer had, had brake trouble and mechanical trouble and expected more, and he said he needed someone to help him to carry on for the balance of the trip.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.857" offset="1814758">This was part of the plaintiff's proof, and this is also a very significant circumstance which hasn't been commented on.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.098" offset="1839731">The plaintiff's own proof showed, that Ormsbee the defendant helper or assistant was on this truck not for just a couple of minutes, not in a rescue operation or anything of the sort, but for a distance of over 100 mile from 100 to 125 miles during which this time this truck and its cargo were being moved towards its destination and it was over a period of five or six hours, he was riding there as a helper before this accident happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.924" offset="1955088">That is a very important circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.735" offset="1962297">Again it was proved by the petitioner's own evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.028" offset="1975463">The only dispute at the trial centered around one thing, the respondent took the position that the emergency, that the petitioner was contending was not the type of emergency, which under Pennsylvania substantive law would have given the driver implied authority to hire an assistant, and now at the --</text>

            <text syncTime="501.853" offset="2110777">No, I was just going to come to that and I want to say that right now, because as you know the first finding which is the crucial one, the controlling one, the one that the Court of Appeals adopted and used it as the basis of its opinion in applying applicable Pennsylvania law was about the emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.351" offset="2192802">The petitioner takes the position that this -- it did not follow from this finding that he was an employee of Aetna the defendant rather than of Fidler, and I believe that is the question Your Honor is asking.</text>

            <label>Mr. William F. Illig</label>
            <text syncTime="534.582" offset="2241703">Number one bear in mind that in the complaint it was alleged that Schroyer the driver was the servant, agent and employee of the defendant Aetna.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.872" offset="2278902">Aetna was the only defendant sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.075" offset="2287679">Number two, the only evidence of the hiring which was brought out by the petitioner concerned extra judicial statements of the dead driver Schroyer maybe in this tavern at Waterford to two people in connection with hiring of Ormsbee.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.911" offset="2347029">This was objected to on the part of the respondent at the trial because it was hearsay as to the defendant Aetna, but if you look at the record at page 36 A, you find that the plaintiff's -- petitioner's counsel Mr. Gornall urged in support of the admission of that very evidence, that it was statements made by Schroyer in the course of his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.689" offset="2450160">Now obviously it couldn't be in the course of his employment for the -- for Fidler, a third party.</text>

            <text syncTime="787.796" offset="3254523">I'd like to point this out further Your Honor that under established Pennsylvania law the restatement Section 79 which is referred to by Judge Goodrich and the Pennsylvania cases, if there is the factual situation where a driver has implied authority to hire an assistant for the protection of his -- in the furtherance of the defendant's interest, that's the employer, and that emergency exists, then as a matter of law, the person employed becomes the servant of the master.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.029" offset="3387538">In other words once there is the finding and here the specific question was asked, Fidler was not in this lawsuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="874.535" offset="3601533">The Court says it is a rule, in the middle of the page, it is a rule universally recognized that the relation of master and servant cannot be imposed upon a person without his consent express or implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.606" offset="3649808">It is upon this exception to the general rule which is quite as well settled as the general rule itself that the plaintiff relies in this case to establish the relation of master and servant under the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.320" offset="3696619">Now notice what he says, “the exception of the servant may engage and assist in the case of emergency where he is unable to perform the work alone, but you have to find an emergency on the road confronting Schroyer that night, that he couldn't go alone and there was reasonable -- in his opinion and it was to be expected in interests of the employer that he had the implied authority, he did have the power to engage an assistant and engaged Mr. Ormsbee to go along with him to complete the trip.”</text>

            <text syncTime="966.715" offset="3970278">Now you have asked the next very important question Mr. Justice Brennan and that is did it follow the jury's finding that he was in the regular course of the defendant Aetna's business.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.347" offset="4008730">I'd like to point out first of all that there was nothing that Your Honor said in the Byrd case to the effect that has been argued here that the statutory language had to be submitted to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.483" offset="4057318">In that case, you writing the majority opinion stated that the petitioner was entitled to have the factual elements of the defense submitted to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.098" offset="4099741">Following the argument of Mr. Shniderman it would likewise have been necessary here to submit the question to the jury as to whether the hiring was for valuable consideration, because the words say that, the words of the Act, and yet it was conceded that he hired him for $25.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.221" offset="4160240">Now the questions come in is, do we say that this was the regular course of business only because of the use of the words in the furtherance of defendant's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.094" offset="4199737">My answer to that is an unequivocal no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.628" offset="4213844">I want to point out that this answer of the jury to this special interrogatory has to be read in the light of the Court's instructions and explanation as required by Federal Rule 49B, and also several cases recently decided by the Third Circuit and I don't believe there is any rule in other circuits to the contrary, to the effect that a special finding must be construed in the light of the instructions given by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.757" offset="4330350">We say that this was a finding that it was in the regular course of the defendant Aetna's business because the circumstances were such as to require the hiring by Schroyer the regular driver of Ormsbee to accompany him for the full balance of the trip for Aetna and assist him in the performance of his duties which he was unable to perform alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.404" offset="4428988">All of that is impliedly to be read in to this interrogatory submitted to the jury because of the specific instructions of the judge and if you will look at 184 A, which is just before the Court reads the interrogatory, look what he says, in explaining it, at the top of the page, “unless you find in this case, that is emergency arose and it was such an emergency that Mr. Schroyer was unable to perform it alone, that is his duties for the continuance of the trip, because of what has been brought out here, if you accept that proposition that the brakes were bad and that was the type of emergency then he would privileged to take on his assistant Mr. Ormsbee.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.371" offset="4616861">And he -- and then he reads the interrogatory at the bottom of the page and he says the words unforeseen contingency mean the emergency I have just mentioned, the inability of Mr. Schroyer to cope with it alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.162" offset="4676002">If you think it reasonable the he engaged in assistance, why you may answer the interrogatory number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.539" offset="4705573">My point in that regard is this, regular course of business is statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.357" offset="4732844">It is not defined in the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.942" offset="4739114">It is then the subject of judicial interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.991" offset="4751339">One of the tests that has been applied, the factual test that has been applied by our Pennsylvania courts throughout, for instance in the case of Smith against the Coal Company it's not cited in our brief unfortunately, in 86, Pennsylvania superior, Hodger against Walker in 277 PA, is whether a person who is hired, is hired to do the work of a regular employee or is hired to assist a regular employee, those are factual tests of regular course of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.957" offset="4879235">The regular course of the defendant's business as Judge Goodrich said, and I don't think it can been controverted is transportation of goods by truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.268" offset="4920404">Here the truck moved towards its destination with this man riding as a helper for a distance of over a 100 miles before the accident happened, over a period of five or six hours, he was there as an assistant ready to help in case of a breakdown, set out flares, help, summon assistance, protect the load, all these were argued by petitioner's counsel as a reason for the emergency and permitting of the hire of the assistant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1532.185" offset="6232064">I think that's a question for the Court, don't you?</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.289" offset="6240528">Mr. Gornall, yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.982" offset="6247320">In other words whether he is on compensation or not and over at 174 A or 173 A, here is another statement by the Court, in other words the finding of trespasser is a conclusion of law and Mr. Knox for the petitioner says the same as the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.641" offset="6317955">It was only the defendant that sought to bring the question of workman's compensation directly before this jury by its seven-point per charge which the Court refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.642" offset="6365915">But we maintain that the Court of Appeals was correct in applying the facts, in apply the legal principles to the facts that were brought out by the petitioner's own evidence in this case and there was no dispute about that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.938" offset="6431117">And that consequently that the petitioner, the family of decedent should be relegated to the remedies which are permitted under the Workman's Compensation Act and as I say that petition has been and still is pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.250" offset="6484407">And when they say that this was decided by the Court of Appeals, Judges Goodrich, Maris and Hasties, three of our best judges I think in our Third Circuit, as solely of the question of law when it is contrary to what is stated here, that it turns on a question of fact we accept the jury's finding of fact and we are applying the law and as this Court has many times said, it is the duty of -- the basic task of the Court of Appeals to apply the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.185" offset="6600077">In conclusion I'd simply like to make this point, the petitioner's case it seems to us comes down to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.489" offset="6625364">It's a case where the petitioner's own proof developed all the evidence of emergency employment which was in the regular course of the defendant's business by virtue of applying the principals to the finding of facts and it's exactly the same as though the petitioner had, had a negligence case and disclosed his own contributory negligence as part of his case, admittedly that is an affirmative defense to be brought out by the defendant, but if the petitioner brings it out as part of his own case then isn't the Court permitted to apply the principles of law to that binding effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.101" offset="6775724">That is our case, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.307" offset="6780635">We feel that as a matter of justice in this case, the petitioners' proper remedies are in workman's compensation where they tried to get in as I say even before the trial of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.579" offset="6825671">And that it did not resolve solely as a question of law, but that when you read the finding of fact in the light of the Court's instructions and all of the evidence that preceded the presenting of the interrogatory, you will see that there was a finding of fact which was adopted by the Court of Appeals as the basis of its decision.</text>
