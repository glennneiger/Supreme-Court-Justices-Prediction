            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">This thing I'm talking about, the sea rates in the Folsom background.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.731" offset="138324">I said sea rate, a special rated commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.370" offset="152848">This is the rate put in where a shipper insists on using his own barges and is a particular kind of carriage, one in which the carriage would prefer not to engage.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.412" offset="204988">They have to because the shipper permitted to furnish his barges and there's a reason for that, any real reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.527" offset="229439">The carriers maintain many of them, fleets and barges, 400 to 600 barges and those barges are sitting there empty and available for use, they're not tank barges in this case because the general rule with shippers -- carriers in a -- furnish special purpose barges.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.447" offset="285132">And a shipper gives you a barge.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.909" offset="290983">It gives you a barge under load.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.065" offset="299656">You have to take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.175" offset="312090">Literally, you're getting a periodic boat, many of these barges, are really many of them are literally fugitive from a junk pile.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.380" offset="352841">Barges which some of them have been bought from carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.895" offset="366947">Carriers retiring from service many years before and you get a barge, you get it on to load, you can't see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.700" offset="398190">The standard barge is 11 feet deep.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.331" offset="408743">You got to put in there, a free board with 9.5 feet of the barge under water, you can't look at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.801" offset="426611">You don't know whether it's loaded, rusted, scaly, leaking, rusted, scaly or what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.407" offset="448972">You can't go under the cargo compartments because they're for cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.118" offset="463809">You can't go to direct compartments because they're not gas free.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.884" offset="478960">And you have to take that barge and you have to tour it.So the carrier does the best thing he can.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.167" offset="508008">He said two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.568" offset="513651">He says, one, “Yes, I'll take your barge, but it's your risk because I don't know what it is and I can't see what it is when you give it to me under load.”</text>
            <text syncTime="113.742" offset="558373">And number two, “You'll warrant me to me that this barge which you overloaded is properly loaded and is fit and proper for the transportation that we're about to undertake.”</text>
            <text syncTime="128.098" offset="615737">He puts both loads of barges down.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.538" offset="629530">That second clause is quite material, the warranty of seaworthiness and proper load, I submit that it is not at all forbidden by Section 1 of the Harter Act or Section -- or Section 2 of one of the Harter Act says that a carrier owns the vessel (Inaudible) to make it seaworthiness carried over into Section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.520" offset="729422">The carrier is in this instance is not the owner of the barge, the shipper is the owner of the barge.</text>

            <text syncTime="189.595" offset="861706">In all of the cases of ordinary commodities which are carried in standard barges, the answer is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.144" offset="887933">This was a tank barge and the carriers do not supply tank barges.So in this -- North Railroad, supply of tank car, supplied by the tank corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.848" offset="942791">In this case, there was no alternative rate because the carrier did not afford any of the service in transportation in the shipper's barge in this particular case, where it might be, again, use assembly that this case is a very short tail of a long dog and should not be permitted to wag the dog.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.328" offset="1028681">We're talking here about one of the biggest transportation features in this country which would go in by leaps and bounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.879" offset="1066924">There's the Mississippi Valley Barge Line Company in 19 -- which I happen to know, 18 billion tons of revenue traffic in one year, revenues of more than $20 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.139" offset="1099943">That's only one of the four big river carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.010" offset="1119378">So, that this is the principle which will come out of this case goes far beyond what is involved in this case, far beyond the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="269.863" offset="1182804">If the -- if the shipper should go to the Interstate Commerce Commission under, whatever it is, Section 308, I've been told, and asked for reparations, of course the reparations wouldn't at all be measurable by the -- by the loss that he suffered of his molasses and of his barge, wouldn't he?</text>
