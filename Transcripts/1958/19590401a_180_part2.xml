            <text syncTime="21.377" offset="188897">But in the case of non-sensitive positions the ordinary employment by the State or by others then the employee is entitled to the benefit of the doubt and therefore ordinary due process requirements must be met.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.491" offset="269354">And it seems to me that that distinction is a reasonable and logical one.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.389" offset="288893">As the Solicitor General pointed out the only power asserted by the Government in this case is the refusal to disclose to a private person secret, top secret in this case military information and it's -- for which it's responsible.And that information is made available to private persons solely for the benefit of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="121.204" offset="588152">But when you balance that against the right itself, preservation of the Government, the greatest responsibility we have or we say the interests -- the people of the United States are entitled to the benefit of the doubt in this restricted area even though -- even though in denying a man access, it may have the consequential effect as it did here of loss of employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="161.215" offset="748231">I understood the Solicitor General this morning to -- to say that some procedure must be given to this man and that if it was arbitrary, completely arbitrary, that it -- it would violate his rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="182.342" offset="832763">Well, as I understood the Solicitor General, we're both in accord that no discriminatory policy can be adopted such as no Democrats may have access to secret information or Republicans.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.896" offset="930983">And -- but I don't believe he intended to go further than that, but in any event if you feel there must be the Constitution requires a form of hearing then I will address myself to the point that this limited, restricted hearing under these circumstances and you must consider all the circumstances may be adequate.</text>

            <text syncTime="308.563" offset="1337657">And except his hearing set forth, there was no direct communication between the Department of Defense and the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.554" offset="1365556">So, that's what caused his discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.536" offset="1377468">Now, later it's true he did have a hearing some seven months later or eight months later before the Eastern Industrial Personnel Security Board but at that time it stipulated that in making its decision the Board took into consideration the whole file to the case which includes information neither the content nor source of which has been -- has been revealed to plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.775" offset="1494497">Now, that's a stipulation of the parties as I understand it.</text>

            <text syncTime="448.478" offset="1897305">Now, if the court please, this power of -- of acting on a doubt or on whether someone is trustworthy is one that's freely used by every private employer in the world, so the effort here is not to subject the Government, that duty is comparable to that of a private person but to greater duties because it is the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.585" offset="1997720">Now, may I point out this.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.240" offset="2008377">We would -- I think we'd have to agree that no one has any constitutional right to access to government secret, no one has any legal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.872" offset="2058846">So then -- then to find a constitutional basis we're saying that Mr. Green is entitled to a constitutional trial type due process hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.600" offset="2117778">We have to find some interest that he has.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.490" offset="2133347">Certainly it's not the right of access.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.503" offset="2153409">So, you say, well it's -- it's financial determinant.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.461" offset="2173262">Here, he consequentially lost his job.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.673" offset="2190085">Now is that -- is that a sufficient interest?</text>
            <text syncTime="524.845" offset="2202728">Certainly it's not enough as Mr. Justice Black said in Lukens Steel after stating that no legal rights were invaded when the Government refused to contract with a private corporation, he said this, “It is by now clear that neither damage nor loss of income in consequence of the action of the Government, which is not an invasion of recognized legal rights is in itself a source of legal rights in the absence of constitutional legislation recognizing it as such.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1304.235" offset="5320286">There's one other facet here and that is what would be the consequences of a holding where the trial type hearing with confrontation as a constitutional prerequisite to a denial of access to secret information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.862" offset="5386846">Now, I'd like to suggest that the consequences of such a hearing may be far worse than the possibilities of inequity or injustice in a particular case under these regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.918" offset="5439091">First, it -- it would mean that the Government, unless it's prepared to produce its sources of information in a hearing, information that is classified, unless it's prepared to do that, it then cannot revoke the clearance or deny clearance to any industrial worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.756" offset="5574405">It must trust those whom it doesn't trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.725" offset="5590288">It must accept as reliable those who it doesn't consider reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.889" offset="5610977">The decree would amount to a mandamus of the executive to disclose publically to the petitioner one of two kinds of information, the secrecy of which the executive has determined to be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.833" offset="5670745">Now, further more, when you define a constitutional principle of that kind, it means it's applicable in time of war as well as in peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.198" offset="5724139">Now, can it be in time of war even, we must admit to access to government secrets, persons whom we don't trust?</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.376" offset="5776906">I think that would seem inexplicable to the, not merely the political branches of the Government, but to the people of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.818" offset="5810657">And wouldn't it mean that a constitutional principle had been defined on such a metaphysical basis as even to endanger the security of the United States?</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.311" offset="5864573">Of course, it would deny to the Government the privilege of every private employer, to deny the -- to the executive in the case of military secrets the privilege to exercise by the judiciary in determining whom it will admit to its judicial secrets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.821" offset="5950673">So, I don't believe that this issue can be resolved merely in terms of -- no exact words so I say, on personal freedom.</text>

            <text syncTime="1681.140" offset="6827969">Attorney General Brownell did make a comparable statement that they could not be produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.475" offset="6849285">Now, on statutory authority, one statute defines the congressional policy that it's illegal for any person having defense or classified information to disclose the same to unauthorized persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.506" offset="6921383">Now, this program we think represents an attempt to faithfully execute that law to define who are authorized and who are unauthorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.285" offset="6956492">And another statute authorizes the head of these department to prescribe regulations for the custody, use, and preservation of records, papers and property and we think that would extend to the protection of property the title of which is not yet under the United States such as guns, aircraft parts, electronic parts being produced in United States because they are appertaining to the department.</text>

            <text syncTime="2211.152" offset="8947963">Well, I think in general, Mr. Justice Harlan, that might be considered and that -- that brings us to our problem of -- of what the Solicitor General said yesterday as I see it, which is as a practical matter, the Government has to deal with -- with private businesses now, if it wants to get these things done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.814" offset="9042631">Now, where does the authority for this kind of a contractual provision, which in reality and which in effect gives the Government control over the employees of -- the people who are employed by private business?</text>

            <text syncTime="2261.241" offset="9148374">Well, the thing that seems to me most important is, that one might concede that the Government could exercise such an authority to him and could by some fair procedure exclude those persons as to whom it is has a doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.090" offset="9239698">I concede this for the purpose of argument only, but still I don't think that it is possible, inherently, in the American system of constitutional government, to have any government official with an absolutely arbitrary power to do this kind of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.581" offset="9345651">I think we are now talking in -- in very real terms of too much power in the hands of the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="2323.620" offset="9397896">Let's assume that on the basis of these things, if in context, these things that are said about Greene, if in context one might have a reasonable doubt as to whether it was wise to permit access or not, still it would have to be a reasonable doubt, and it can't be a reasonable doubt unless there's been something approximating a fair procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.123" offset="9535822">Now, I am not necessarily talking about a judicial trial or anything like that, but there has to be a fair procedure for determining what the facts are and how they fit into the context.</text>

            <text syncTime="2542.188" offset="10272162">And it isn't fair and it isn't correct to say, that because Greene said that he knew Silvermaster who incidentally was Mrs. the former Mrs. Greene's superior in the Department of Agriculture and that I am comprehensible that he wouldn't have had some contact with his -- with his wife's superior.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.754" offset="10382399">That isn't the equivalent of saying that Greene knew that Silvermaster back in these years, 15 years ago, that Silvermaster was a spy, if he was a spy.</text>
