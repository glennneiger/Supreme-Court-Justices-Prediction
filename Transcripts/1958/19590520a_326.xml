            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 326, in the Matter of Disciplinary Proceedings against Harriet Bouslog Sawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.119" offset="191822">Mr. Barlow, you may continue your argument.</text>

          <turn speaker="a_william_barlow" startTime="25.786" stopTime="521.629">
            <label>Mr. A. William Barlow</label>
            <text syncTime="25.786" offset="206555">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.255" offset="228394">Perhaps some of the Court may be wondering why a speech that was made in 1952 is before the Court in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.400" offset="280952">I may be facetious, yet, I am sincere when I say that the reason for the long delay is the fact that the petitioner has been accorded due process all the way along the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.087" offset="351692">In 1952, December 14, she made this talk at Honokaa on the Island of Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.749" offset="390353">The case in which she was engaged as counsel terminated sometime in June of 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.414" offset="437060">Subsequent to the termination of the trial, Federal Judge John Wiig, who presided at the trial, referred the behavior of the petitioner to the Bar Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.372" offset="488887">The matter was then referred to the Ethics Committee in July of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.778" offset="530474">In September of 1954, the petitioner requested a bill of particulars, which, were supplied to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.783" offset="566523">In November of 1954, the Ethics Committee conducted a full-scale hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.466" offset="597243">At which time, the petitioner was represented by a very able counsel and at which time, she had the opportunity of presenting on her behalf any and all witnesses that she thought were people who could testify to what she had said at the time of the incident related to in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.477" offset="701315">The hearing consumed 468 pages and ended on December the 8th, 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.424" offset="733080">The Ethics Committee Report which found Mrs. Bouslog guilty of impugning the integrity of the Court, of interfering with the administration of justice, and creating disrespect for the courts on the first complaint, and on the second complaint, with conducting a studied interrogation of a sick juror immediately after the trial in violation of Canon 23, the American Bar Association Opinion 109, and the rulings in the Rakes and Millie cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.547" offset="929520">Subsequent to that report by the Bar Association Ethics Committee, the Supreme Court issued an order to show cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.555" offset="977586">That order was issued July 8th, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.314" offset="996603">The petitioner was granted an extension of time to September of 1955, within which, to file an answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.462" offset="1025233">Instead of the return of the order to show cause, she filed a motion to dismiss the order to show cause on October 19, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.261" offset="1072462">More time for filing petitioner's return to the order to show cause was requested and petitioner was granted to December.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.505" offset="1105377">And finally, the argument was set for January of 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.596" offset="1133798">On January 7th, 1955, petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration of the order, denying the motion to dismiss the order to show cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.224" offset="1172250">This motion was extensively argued and denied by order filed November 29, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.973" offset="1203284">A return to the order to show cause was finally filed by the petitioner on December 2, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.355" offset="1232750">Another motion for continuance by petitioner followed, and another hearing was held.On a date set for trial, which was January 9, 1956, a pretrial conference was held with counsel for the Bar Association, counsel for the Attorney General and counsel for the petitioner being present.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.527" offset="1317491">Two days later, another delay was occasioned by the petitioner filing a suggestion of disqualification of Associate Justices Stainback and Rice of the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.414" offset="1369004">Extensive argument on this motion was again held by the Territorial Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.474" offset="1397217">The Territorial Supreme Court, incidentally, held that neither Justice was disqualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.790" offset="1422503">However, Justice Stainback withdrew on his own motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.811" offset="1442565">At the pretrial conference, it was determined that under Rule 19, the petitioner could avail herself of a trial de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.526" offset="1485511">However, the petitioner, through her counsel, and counsel for the Bar Association, and the Attorney General, and the Court stipulated that instead of a trial de novo, the matter would proceed upon a record submitted before the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.280" offset="1584462">The opinion of the Court was filed April 6, 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.526" offset="1617481">The Court found that the complaint was sustained by convincing proof, by credible evidence of more than a mere preponderance.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.928" offset="1655097">The Court found that the charges under both complaints were proven and found that the petitioner was guilty of gross misconduct on both counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.621" offset="1705880">The petitioner then appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals under Section 1293, alleging that there was a constitutional question involved and also alleging that her right to practice law had a money tag or a value attached to it that by virtue of the fact that she was suspended for one year, the matter in controversy or the value in controversy was the amount of money that she had earned in previous years.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.167" offset="1872018">The Bar Association took the position that this was a simple matter of discipline involving the Canons of Ethics, that there was no First Amendment constitutional question involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.419" offset="1925099">The Bar Association took the position that insofar as the license to practice law was concerned, it was priceless and you could not attach a price tag to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.685" offset="1986121">The petitioner filed her affidavit, stating that she made an excess of $5000 and the Court, on the first hearing, granted her a stay pending the determination of the case on its merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.941" offset="2063130">Two Justices Justice concurring, and Justice Lemmon wrote a dissenting opinion in which he indicated that as far as he was concerned, that it was a very simple disciplinary matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.518" offset="2141393">There was no constitutional question involved and that insofar as he was concerned, you could not attach a price tag to the practice of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="563.099" offset="2355806">We, in the Territory of Hawaii, at the present time, have no reciprocity with any other state insofar as admission by a motion is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.062" offset="2399587">When I went there, 13, 14 years ago, I had to take a bar examination that lasted five days.</text>

            <text syncTime="2459.966" offset="9943228">Mrs. Bouslog came down, she found the brother sick in bed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.938" offset="9963081">She did not interview the juror on that occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.254" offset="9976351">She came back the following day and conducted a very searching examination, an inquiry of the juror as to what transpired in the jury room.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.726" offset="10022327">And I think that our brief shows that the juror, presumably, related 30 different incidents that occurred in the jury room and she submitted that affidavit to Judge Wiig in an attempt to impeach the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.727" offset="10114278">The judge, as I recall the situation, did not have a hearing on that affidavit, but the Bar Association charged her with this violation of conducting a studied interrogation of the Juror Fuller.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.254" offset="10204348">And the evidence before the Court in the record will indicate that Mrs. Fuller had made many of the statements to Mrs. Bouslog, that Mrs. Bouslog did not advise Judge Wiig of the exact physical condition or mental condition of the juror, that she related to Judge Wiig the conversation that she allegedly had with the juror, and the many things that the juror told her occurred in the jury room.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.195" offset="10376129">And the -- Mrs. Bouslog did not tell the judge in her affidavit that the Juror Fuller was too sick to sign an affidavit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3743.009" offset="15075453">Mr. Justice Harlan, if I might reformulate the question you put to my adversary, I would say that the holding below was that it is unprofessional conduct for a lawyer of record in a pending case to comment upon that case in the manner petitioner did here because, and this is the guts of it, I think, that is an attack on the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.269" offset="15180466">And I think that is the question begging aspect of the findings of the courts below.</text>

            <text syncTime="3778.141" offset="15215888">“Attack” obviously embraces criticism and fair comment, and a lawyer's utterances have to go beyond, it seems to me, criticism and fair conduct even of the conduct of the judge himself before he brings the Court into disrespect, before he interferes with a fair administration of justice, before he loses his First Amendment protection.</text>
