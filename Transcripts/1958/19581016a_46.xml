            <label>Mr. Earl E. Pollock</label>
            <text syncTime="33.193" offset="236126">Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court this matter is involved in the deductibility of certain travel expenses of construction workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.857" offset="282833">I would like to read the questions involved from the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.459" offset="313240">Where petitioner has entered upon certain construction employment away from their established residences prior to the taxable year for periods lasting in approximately 20 1/2 months, 12 1/2 months, and 8 1/2 months respectively and terminated such employment during the taxable year, the question is presented as to whether or not the amount expended during taxable year of board and lodge while so employed as construction worker at or near the construction site and for transportation expenses to return to their respective residences upon the termination of such employment, are non-deductible expenses within the provisions of Section 24 (a) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.422" offset="493066">And if it is determined that said expenditures are not personal within the provision of Section 24 (a) (1), a further question was presented as to whether or not the expenses in question are deductible under the provisions of Section 24 (a) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 as amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.212" offset="580211">These two sections, Section 23 and Section 24, I would like to read, “In computing net income there shall be allowed as deductions - (a) Expenses; (1) Trade or Business Expenses; (A) In General all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during a taxable year, traveling expenses, including the entire amount expended for meals and lodging while away from home in the pursuit of a trade or business; and Section 24 - general rule; in computing net income, no deductions shall in any case be allowed in respect to personal, living or family expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.704" offset="762232">A summary of the facts; there are three petitioners involved and the respective periods of employment set forth in the question, 8 1/2 months, 12 1/2 months, and 20 1/2 months respectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.014" offset="819388">Each of these petitioners had a fixed residence for the entire year in controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.321" offset="868707">Each of the petitioners is a construction worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.205" offset="884172">Each obtained his employment through his union local.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.084" offset="899741">Each belongs to the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of a plumbing and pipe fitting industry of the United States and Canada, hereafter referred to as the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.325" offset="940701">The same hiring procedures were followed in respect to all the employments of the various petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.875" offset="974869">A construction site is a place of limited employment for all construction workers both employees and employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.612" offset="1005798">By its very nature it must end in a relatively short period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.684" offset="1038085">Construction work by its nature depends upon increasing the local supply of skilled labor by bringing in workers from various parts of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.728" offset="1082284">The journeymen and craftsman normally work on several construction sites in the course of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.870" offset="1102869">Some jobs on rare occasions last several years, but normally the jobs last a matter weeks or months.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.444" offset="1141112">Turning to petitioner Peurifoy, Petitioner Peurifoy was saying he lived in his own home that he had built personally which is located at Kure Beach, North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.949" offset="1191163">His union local was located about 20 miles away in the City of Wilmington, North Carolina, Local number 329.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.093" offset="1223764">His practice of work was to obtain work through his union local for an area as close as he usually could to his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.613" offset="1273814">He returned -- when work was not immediately available near his home, he would take work wherever the union could find employment and would return to his home on weekends.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.424" offset="1325119">His work itinerary is set more in the petitioner's brief and it involved about six jobs which lasted from one week to 20 1/2 months, covering about a four-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.762" offset="1390425">Petitioner Stines was married with one child.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.951" offset="1411218">He owned his home in Raleigh, North Carolina in the sense that he was purchasing his home in Raleigh.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.421" offset="1453014">His wife and child lived in his home for the entire year, 1953, which is the union controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.934" offset="1491153">Petitioner Stines worked out of Raleigh.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.879" offset="1502856">His union local, number 725, was located in Raleigh.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.695" offset="1522186">His practice of obtaining work was very -- it was identical to the general practice of Peurifoy.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.972" offset="1551235">He would -- would contact his union local for work and he would then take work as close to his home as possible and when such work was not available, he would take it at more distant locations.</text>

            <text syncTime="433.520" offset="1837432">Now, petitioner Stines, his employment itinerary involved about 30 jobs which lasted from two weeks to 12 1/2 months over about a four-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.010" offset="1895424">During the taxable year he was employed at Charleston, South Carolina, in Fort Bragg, North Carolina for periods of three weeks and seven and a half weeks respectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.300" offset="1932622">Now, the commissioner has conceded that expenses which were incurred in respect to his employments at Charleston and Fort Bragg were deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.880" offset="1982882">In respect to petitioner Hall, petitioner Hall, the situation was very similar to that of petitioner Stines.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.168" offset="2016005">He was married with three children.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.507" offset="2025409">He was -- purchasing his home in Raleigh and his wife and children resided in this home during the entire year of 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.233" offset="2064280">Petitioner Hall was also a member of Local 725, located in Raleigh.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.122" offset="2087894">His employment itinerary, as set forth in the brief, involved about nine jobs, lasting two weeks to eight and a half months over a four-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.169" offset="2128018">Now, the petitioners make their first point at this stage in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.354" offset="2156753">We brought them out -- position on this contention that these facts which are not all the facts by any means ably support the trial court's decision and that the principle is a well-established law that the tax rule determinations of a trial court are not being upset by an appellate action.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.146" offset="2275976">The second contention of petitioners is this, that the results of the Court of Appeals below are bottomed solely on the doctrine which we maintain is erroneous that home is synonymous with post of duty and this is the heart of this matter as the one that requires full amplification.</text>

            <text syncTime="634.571" offset="2641690">The heart of this matter is Section 23 and I'm going to use abbreviated language if the Court will permit in Section 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.345" offset="2676799">Now Section 23 says this, “You can deduct family expenses away from home in a pursuit of a trade.”</text>
            <text syncTime="651.927" offset="2711071">This is a positive thing in that it creates a deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.459" offset="2729253">Now Section 24 says you cannot deduct personal expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.391" offset="2752972">Now Your Honor, to my mind, this entire matter comes to rest on two words.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.562" offset="2781602">The meaning of the -- word “home” in Section 23 and the meaning of the word “personal” in Section 24, that is all.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.937" offset="2823084">The entire matter has been a subject of confusion and controversy for over 30 years in the courts and basically I think it's very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.678" offset="2858088">To begin with, in the 90-Day letter which is the foundation for disallowance of this deduction there was one ground and one ground only that petitioner alleged as a basis for denial.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.959" offset="2927156">He said these expenses are-- are personal.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.579" offset="2941680">That is a Section 24 matter exclusively.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.249" offset="2956413">He said these expenses are personal, that's all.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.202" offset="2972191">Now, the respondent in his brief in the summary of the argument has bought him in my opinion, his entire case on his position that the petitioner's expenses were not incurred away from home.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.395" offset="3044916">And I would like to point out that the significance of home is a Section 23 matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.655" offset="3066023">It has nothing to do on the face of it and we will -- I'll maintain it has nothing to do in actuality with Section 24 regarding personal.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.727" offset="3106252">And the -- the Commissioner's statement in his brief is this, in the Commissioner's view the taxpayers here are not entitled to the deduction claimed as traveling expenses because they were not incurred away from home.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.133" offset="3159855">Now something has got to be wrong on face of it when the Commissioner in his brief is saying that these expenses are not deductible because they're away from home and the Commissioner's 90-day letter saying they're not deductible because they're personal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1038.709" offset="4258252">As I pointed out this -- this doctrine erases in effect Section 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.597" offset="4289808">It -- it nullifies, it gives -- it gives a Commissioner, once this doctrine is applied the Commissioner then -- I don't know how to make this expression exactly but has the taxpayer within his power because from that moment, the Commissioner's position is out from under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.679" offset="4386043">The statute does no longer apply and the only question then is, is this.</text>

            <text syncTime="1089.260" offset="4460440">Now there may be a factual inquiry as to determine whether or not you're going to apply the doctrine, but if the doctrine is applied, or excuse me, if the doctrine is valid then it should be universal application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.093" offset="4519790">And as pointed out if it were of universal application, that is if it were good law, it would deny deduction to everyone in a literal sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.712" offset="4558242">So then the Commissioner must do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.225" offset="4568273">He must find methods for not applying the doctrine and I submit that here is no more graphic proof of then validity than this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.325" offset="4604635">If this were a case -- is based on -- on the presumption that we do not qualify for an exception in this very doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.852" offset="4638804">(Inaudible) How can there be an exception to the statue to primary to wring from deduction only?</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.966" offset="4675271">Logically, I don't think there can be, but the Commissioner in seeking to justify this, tried to justify on equitable ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.544" offset="4725530">Well I say in regard to that -- that the Commissioner is from my outside observation has a duty to enforce the Internal Revenue Law and not define equitable ground for not enforcing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.103" offset="4795747">So if this doctrine is valid law, then it looks to me like that there's some question as to how thoroughly the Commissioner is -- is enforcing the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1233.153" offset="5035969">The traveling salesman usually has a headquarters and a firm and a place that he works out of and the Bureau not only recognize that that is his post of the duty.</text>
