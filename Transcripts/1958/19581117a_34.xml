            <label>Mr. Royal W. France</label>
            <text syncTime="12.053" offset="151594">Chief Justice, may the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.422" offset="165073">This case comes before the Court for the second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.484" offset="185344">It arises under the same statute and under the same procedures as were involved in the case of Sweezy -- Sweezy versus New Hampshire, which was recently decided by this Court and as to which we think the decision of the Court is conclusive upon the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.671" offset="270085">The case when it came before this Court was remanded to the Supreme Court of New Hampshire for reconsideration in the light of the decision in Sweezy versus New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.217" offset="340198">The Supreme Court of New Hampshire having reconsidered said that they have not altered their view.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.849" offset="374784">In the first decision, there were three of the judges of the New Hampshire Court who were in favor of affirming the sentence of contempt and then, the second -- and two who dissented, and then the second decision that the Court having changed its composition.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.365" offset="444792">There were four in favor of reaffirming their own decision and one who dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.673" offset="478020">They -- Your Honors will recall that the statute under which the Attorney General of New Hampshire proceeds is one which relates to subversive activities which I define as activities looking toward the overthrow of the Government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.041" offset="563493">We shall present four points for the consideration of the Court, the first that the information sought by the Attorney General is irrelevant and it involves protected First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.367" offset="632874">Second, that the -- a mandate -- mandate of the New Hampshire Legislature is vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.789" offset="662549">And third, that this statute has been superseded under the doctrine of Pennsylvania versus Nelson.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.157" offset="708002">And fourth, that the indefinite sentence is a cruel and unusual punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.880" offset="730885">I will present the first two of these points and my colleague, Mr. Boudin will present the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.620" offset="765889">In order to understand how this case comes before the Court and why the Attorney General of New Hampshire appears to think that the information he seeks is relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.728" offset="822314">It becomes necessary for me to tell you something about Dr. Willard Uphaus, the appellant, and World Fellowship of which he is the Executive Director.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.319" offset="872678">It clearly appears from the record that here is an unusual type of man who takes quite literally the principles enunciated in the Sermon on the Mount.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.792" offset="926490">He was a -- a religious youth active in the YMCA and in the Methodist Church.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.139" offset="959927">He -- he went to college and from there, to the Yale University, where he took his Doctor of Philosophy degree in the field of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.294" offset="1008515">He became a professor of religion in a Midwestern College and later at Yale University.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.436" offset="1041115">Following this, he became the Director of the Religion and Labor Foundation, an organization which was formed by religious and labor leaders with a view to discussing common problems affecting these two groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.817" offset="1122617">While he was serving in that capacity, he was invited with a group of other -- rather prominent Americans to attend a World Peace Conference which should have represented delegates from both sides of the so-called Iron Curtain.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.066" offset="1215613">This conference was to be in London.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.183" offset="1228152">While they were on the high seas, the British Government decided that it would not admit the delegates from the Eastern European Countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.367" offset="1276844">And the site of the conference was transferred to Warsaw.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.476" offset="1301295">From Warsaw, the appellant made a visit of 10 days to the Soviet Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.622" offset="1329821">This trip is one of the main features of the Attorney General's complaint against Dr. Uphaus.</text>

          <turn speaker="royal_w_france" startTime="320.134" stopTime="600.663">
            <label>Mr. Royal W. France</label>
            <text syncTime="320.134" offset="1383946">In 1948, I think, of March.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.203" offset="1396172">The -- the -- when he returned, there was a schism in the religion in Labor Committee as to whether he had done the right thing in taking this trip.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.085" offset="1459702">And he left that organization and became the Executive Director of the American Peace Crusade.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.871" offset="1498885">The American Peace Crusade was an organization of which I happened to be the attorney, which came under attack by the Attorney General of the United States on the theory that it was, in some sense, a subversive organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.198" offset="1576208">Now, the record in that case showed that there was nothing agitated or done by the American Peace Crusade except to urge a more resilient foreign policy and peaceful coexistence with the Soviet Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.064" offset="1643604">However, there were also the Attorney General claims in the organization, some people who were or were reputed to be Communists, people of the type of Paul Robeson.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.160" offset="1703999">This was deliberately formed by the founders in order that people of different views might come together to discuss peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.614" offset="1757811">It was the concept of the American Peace Crusade that it doesn't do any good to discuss peace with your friends or those who agree with you that the -- it's necessary for people of varying views to come together.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.012" offset="1811414">And that -- that it is necessary for the representatives of our Government to discuss these affairs with those countries with whom we are not in accord.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.574" offset="1849657">So, that if there were Communists in the American Peace Crusade, it was with deliberate intent, represented the American Peace Crusade met with the Quakers in Philadelphia in a joint meeting in which the problems of peace were discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.226" offset="1916322">Following his connection with the American Peace Crusade and before it was attacked by the Attorney General, it's now -- it has never been determined by a litigation that it was in fact a subversive organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.921" offset="1979016">The matter is now under judicial consideration awaiting the determination of this Court with regard to the Communist, the listing of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.610" offset="2021857">So, that neither this organization, nor any of the other organizations which have been mentioned by the appellee as being a cause why he investigated Willard Uphaus and the World Fellowship have ever been found by the courts, in accordance with the doctrine laid down in the Joint Anti-Fascist case to -- to be in fact subversive, and indeed, they -- as was held in Wieman versus Updegraff by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.159" offset="2163963">The list itself was never designed for such purposes as it is now being used for.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.311" offset="2200639">And certainly, no one under that decision can be held to be suspected of anything unless he had -- was shown to have knowledge, scienter that the organization was in fact subversive.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.866" offset="2270856">The appellant's position here is that he not only had no scienter that it was subversive, but then he knew these organizations were not subversive, that they were indeed organizations to which a loyal American had a right to the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.053" offset="2339610">Willard Uphaus following his directorship in the American Peace Crusade became the Director of New Hampshire corporation known here as World Fellowship.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.109" offset="2403767">World Fellowship was founded by an idealistic person named Willard with the idea of bringing people of all races, creeds, political opinions together for adult education and discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.774" offset="2470431">And that he gave to the organization a large acreage in the White Mountains where they were to establish the World Fellowship camp.</text>

            <text syncTime="622.092" offset="2591744">The -- the organization operated a summer camp.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.353" offset="2628733">It invited paying guests.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.196" offset="2644198">It -- it had guest lecturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.675" offset="2662066">Many of them are clergymen, many of them college professors, social workers who presented various aspects of human relations including the problems relating to peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.476" offset="2737298">Now, the Attorney General in his statement of reason why this organization should be subject to investigation has listed on page -- no, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.116" offset="2879822">I want this for a reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.278" offset="2888495">I thought I had it slipped in this brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.384" offset="2972923">On pages 30 to -- 30 to 31 of this brief, the appellee has listed the reasons why he believes that this information is so vital to the State of New Hampshire that the interference with First Amendment Rights is justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.310" offset="3060590">Now, the first of these reasons is that the Willard Uphaus by his own testimony --</text>

            <text syncTime="744.721" offset="3082219">I'm reading on page 30 of appellee's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.948" offset="3123179">That the witness, Willard Uphaus by his own testimony, has been a member or sponsor of many organizations which persons in positions or responsibility in the United States have believed to be Communist-infiltrated or Communist-controlled, and hence, at the very least potentially subversive in the language of the New Hampshire statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.896" offset="3218996">Now, this is really the gravamen of the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.074" offset="3235715">The Attorney General has listed a large number of speakers and guests at the World Fellowship in New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.181" offset="3276048">There is no suggestion that any of these speakers advocated anything improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.692" offset="3298095">There's no evidence that they advocated any opinion proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.662" offset="3313977">The camp was an open camp to which not only people who knew about it were solicited but they had road signs inviting guests to come.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.383" offset="3352952">And so, the -- the idea that there was anything conspiratorial about this camp is really -- there's no foundation for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.963" offset="3403212">However, after he had asked Willard Uphaus an inquiry before him or about himself and Willard Uphaus had frankly stated that he belonged to various organizations which were under condemnation by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.085" offset="3483669">He stated that he had never been a Communist.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.705" offset="3498193">That he did not believe in the use of force and violence in any context.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.358" offset="3516792">That he was a religious pacifist.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.955" offset="3527241">And that the organizations to which he belonged were peace organizations or organizations related to the subject -- subjects in which he vitally believed.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.809" offset="3582621">At the back of the Attorney General's brief is a list, quite an extensive list of the alleged errors of appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.562" offset="3637582">Appendix A on page 39 contains what the appellee considers to be the reasons why the -- his -- his demand for the production of the guest list and the correspondents with speakers that this institution was justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.723" offset="3722219">National Religion and Labor Foundation Secretary has spoken of that, American Peace Crusade, World Fellowship, National Council on American-Soviet Friendship, a contributor.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.597" offset="3773733">Here again, is a -- an organization which has never been found to be subversive.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.639" offset="3789928">It aims are to bring about peaceful coexistence with the Soviet Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.126" offset="3811871">National Committee for the Protection of the Foreign Born, that -- this again is an organization which is interested in the preservation of the rights of foreign born citizens, certainly nothing improper or subversive in this sort of activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.488" offset="3893373">Citizens Committee for Harry Bridges, cited as a Communist organization by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.723" offset="3922213">Now, this organization which was favored (Inaudible) for Harry Bridges was sponsored by the CIO Leadership and many people in -- prominent people in American life.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.959" offset="3975189">The American Friends for Spanish Democracy, many -- many fine people including clergymen and liberals all over the country believed in the defense of the Spanish democracy as against the Fascist Rebellion.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.491" offset="4029315">And certainly Mr. -- Dr. Uphaus has no apology for belonging to an organization that was the friends of the Spanish democracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.216" offset="4076231">A petition -- he signed a petition for clemency in the Rosenberg case.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.569" offset="4093680">The Rosenberg case, I have it here, a photostatic copy of this petition which contains the names of several hundred of the prominent clergymen and religious leaders of the country in which they asked the President to exercise -- to suspend the death sentence in the Rosenberg case as indeed -- did the late Pope Pious XII whether or not the Attorney General believes that that clemency should have been granted to the Rosenberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.463" offset="4213217">It was certainly a protected activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.659" offset="4230040">Now, the American Technical Society for the aid to Hispanic democracy, Dr. Uphaus said he never heard of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.976" offset="4263267">But if it existed, he probably would have been glad to join them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.403" offset="4285001">The National Council for Peace of which he was the Director of the Conference was held in a large Methodist Church in Washington with clergymen and other religious leaders present, and some of the most prominent religious leaders of the country spoke at that conference.</text>

            <text syncTime="1460.322" offset="5944613">And Dr. Scott Nearing, a famous educator according to the Attorney General ran for the -- for office on the Communist ticket in 1928 and was later expelled by the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.056" offset="6003545">This is the kind of information submitted to the General Court of New Hampshire as justifying the invasion of First Amendment rights of not only the appellant here but of the guests whom he has entertained at the World Fellowship camp.</text>

            <text syncTime="1505.163" offset="6124022">It will be apparent to the Court from what I have briefly said and from a closer reading of the record that here is an intensely religiously motivated man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.749" offset="6162369">He is a pacifist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.796" offset="6170520">The Attorney General in his report equates that -- equates pacifism with the violent overthrow of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.817" offset="6214614">This is about as far removed as I can imagine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.388" offset="6228929">On page 14 of our brief, we quote the appellee, what he said in the course of the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.160" offset="6259963">The bottom of page 14, “It is, of course, obvious that Mr. Uphaus isn't going to write someone and ask them to come and make a speech about overthrowing the Government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.979" offset="6311267">At the same time, the advocacy of a doctrine that we lay down our arms in favor of a few sticks and stones paving the way for the coming of the Soviet Union is just as much an advocacy of the overthrow of Government.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.298" offset="6372603">If this is not a farfetched concept, truly the description of the past disposition in this passage is -- is rather distorted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.978" offset="6415235">I don't know that pacifists advocate the use of sticks and stones but the concept that a religious pacifist is thereby advocating the overthrow of government by force and violence stretches imagination far beyond the bounds of mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.624" offset="6505827">There's only one substantive statement in the -- in the entire record that -- of anything that occurred at the World Fellowship camp that could be the -- in anyway remoted -- remotely related to the purposes of the Attorney General's inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.207" offset="6584195">He was asked whether he had asked a blessing on revolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.470" offset="6601226">The incident was so trivial that he'd forgotten it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.523" offset="6613452">When the Attorney General questioned me, he said, “Oh, yes,” someone had -- had handed him a little slip with the words, “Some have bread, others have none.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.972" offset="6655248">God bless the revolution.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.346" offset="6664756">The -- the State Supreme Court of New Hampshire uses this as a part of the justification for its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.525" offset="6697462">But as really not have pointed out revolution is not a violent affair necessarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.941" offset="6719091">The -- the Industrial Revolution was one of the greatest in history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.490" offset="6741347">I assume that the Revolution of The New Deal, many people thought it was revolutionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.363" offset="6768828">And the Attorney General himself I think would concede that there -- the mere use of the term revolution in a rather light and flippant way like that scarcely amounts to an advocacy of force and violence such as to justify this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.984" offset="6859316">And I might say that Willard Uphaus does believe that if we would accept the Sermon on the Mountain as being something by which we must live, that it would affect a revolution in this beautiful and bountiful world which would change it so that we would turn bombs into plow shears and guided missiles into pruning hooks.</text>

            <text syncTime="1728.530" offset="7017514">Chief Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice, and Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.512" offset="7041442">In addition to the basic First Amendment argument which was made in Sweezy and which with the burden of Dr. France's remarks here, we present to Your Honor an argument that are also made in Sweezy, some refracts the -- on reading the briefs in Sweezy made much better by Professor Emerson and by me, namely the question of supersedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.269" offset="7132453">The question as to whether or not under Pennsylvania against Nelson, that doctrine, the State power of inquiry in this matter, not talking generally, has not been superseded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.461" offset="7185220">We think that there has been because of the particular language of the statute involved here and because of a particular kind of inquiry engaged in by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.328" offset="7232658">The inquiry in the present case was made under two resolutions or statutes of 1953 and 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.919" offset="7271006">Those resolutions which appear in the appendix to our brief, both tie in the 1953 and 1955 right of inquiry of the Attorney General with the enforcement of the Sedition Act of 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.469" offset="7341223">They provide, these resolutions, that the Attorney General is to investigate violations of the Act of 1951, and in addition to decide whether or not there are subversive persons within the meaning of the Act of 1951 located in the State of New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.410" offset="7421053">Therefore, it would appear to us that the Act of 1951 if it was -- it were invalid under Pennsylvania against Nelson would furnish no basis for the inquiry in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.317" offset="7472671">The tie in I may say between the Act of 1951 and the investigation of 1953 and 1955 is virtually conceded and is set forth in greater detail by the Supreme Court of New Hampshire in Nelson against Wyman, another one of these investigating cases, which I have quoted at pages 6 and 7 on my reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.104" offset="7567757">Now, the question that arises of whether the Act of 1951 which we term is an Act which has been superseded under the doctrine of the Nelson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.990" offset="7615300">It is an action which provides -- which relates in the Preamble that there is an existence in International Communist conspiracy directed against the United States and against the States of this Union with the attempt to take them over on behalf of a foreign power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.442" offset="7689174">It provides for the existence of seditious persons and seditious organizations in each case obviously tying them to the world Communist movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.450" offset="7745181">And again, in Nelson against Wyman as Your Honors will see from our brief, the Supreme Court of New Hampshire has recognized that this is a statute dealing with the same subject matter as the statute involved in Pennsylvania against Nelson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.910" offset="7814980">Except that, the Supreme Court of New Hampshire has taken the position both in Nelson against Wyman which are referred before and here that the State of New Hampshire has a right to protect itself by a sedition statute against this kind of international Communist movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.795" offset="7894601">It is essentially a doctrine of state sovereignty asserted with respect to sedition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.612" offset="7913827">A doctrine that we think this Court has said does not exist in Pennsylvania against Nelson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.907" offset="7946951">Now, there are two arguments that are made here by the Attorney General and a position that's taken by the court below with respect to the question of supersedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.035" offset="7983522">The Attorney General suggests without clearly stating it in his brief, but I want to give it the -- the greatest power here that the power of inquiry is not subject to the Supremacy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.204" offset="8036185">In other words, that while a state sedition law making it criminal to engage in certain activities would be superseded or might be superseded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.762" offset="8070457">I don't want to make any contention on his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.276" offset="8080488">A state power of inquiry would not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.824" offset="8094699">Now, we think that given the peculiar circumstance to this case, namely, an inquiry directly predicated upon the statute, a sedition statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.991" offset="8131375">But even aside from the peculiar circumstance of this case, the power of inquiry necessarily relates to the power to pass a law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.922" offset="8167111">And if the State of New Hampshire could not pass a state sedition law validly of 1951, it could not proceed to investigate how that law was working and to decide whether subversion -- subversive persons referred to it in that law were actually in New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.700" offset="8234193">Secondly, the Attorney General suggests that or rather the -- the Attorney General suggests that Pennsylvania against Nelson is not applicable because he construes that decision as suspending rather than as rendering invalid state sedition laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.911" offset="8319039">Now, I must only suggest that so long as the state sedition laws are invalid or are suspended, the Attorney General's power to investigate is also either invalid or suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.980" offset="8367313">We will take either choice because in either case would of course prevent the power of inquiry here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.935" offset="8391137">Now, the State of New Hampshire through its Supreme Court has made, I think, a -- a solid argument but we think equally disposed of by this Court's decision in Pennsylvania against Nelson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.387" offset="8436903">It says that possibly, doesn't say this inquiry with that kind, that possibly a State might find local sedition which it could direct its attention to by a valid statute despite Pennsylvania against Nelson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.766" offset="8498448">And Your Honor may -- Your Honors may recall the following Pennsylvania against Nelson, two state courts, one in Kentucky in the Braden case and the other in Massachusetts in the Gilbert case, both dismissed, in one case, reversed the conviction, dismissed the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.230" offset="8560306">The other case dismissed the indictment without evidence being taken in the course of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.572" offset="8585697">And in both those cases it was suggested on pursuance that of course the court was not deciding that in the speculative situation of sedition directed against a State alone, the State would be powerless to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.705" offset="8646196">But we are dealing here not with a speculative situation but with a situation of the international Communist conspiracy as described in this statute which has not isolated the State of New Hampshire anymore in the matter that let us say a Shays' Rebellion isolated Massachusetts in 1786.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.414" offset="8733027">We are dealing with an international conspiracy as found by the various legislatures which has never selected one state or another, not even New Hampshire and its special interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.975" offset="8779316">And the Attorney General of the New Hampshire has very candidly and well-stated repeatedly in speeches and in briefs and in the Sweezy case that it's impossible to conceive of sedition against the State that is not related to sedition against the United States in the modern sense and vice versa.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.588" offset="8861759">As he's read -- said to Your Honors in Sweezy, "Well, I'd paraphrase it so I won't repeat it."</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.683" offset="8886105">And when you read his brief in this case and his arguments made to the court below and, of course, through the printed records, you will see that he is repeatedly pointing out the importance of preserving the Union not just New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.078" offset="8943679">And the fact that he relies upon -- at the Attorney General's list of the United States and the congressional investigating committee hearings which of course deal with national organizations which he believed to be subversive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.940" offset="8999163">And in each case, the Attorney General of New Hampshire is saying that he has a right on behalf of New Hampshire to aid the Federal Government in connection with its nationwide sedition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.604" offset="9049840">And so, we say that treating this particular statute, the Act of 1951, as a statute not limited to New Hampshire, recognizing of the Court in the Gilbert case, that he has referred to said, that the techniques which were involved are the familiar paraphernalia of Communist agitation for the overthrow of Government in general and cannot be directed separately, and exclusively against the Government in this Commonwealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.623" offset="9161853">And in Gilbert, the indictments refer to with the counter indictment related exclusively to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.247" offset="9192364">But what the Court in Massachusetts recognized as the paraphernalia -- the familiar paraphernalia of Communist methods directed against the Nation as a whole applied in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.383" offset="9236877">And in this point, I think I might rest with Mr. Wyman's very succinct statement quoted at page 6 of my brief when he said, “National security is state security and state security is national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.175" offset="9300093">A threat to one is a threat to both.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.779" offset="9322454">Now, I turn but only for a moment because I'm very anxious for Your Honors to hear Mr. -- Dr. France in rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2316.038" offset="9367489">And I do so briefly really because seven members of this Court have already stated their views on whether the Attorney General acted in Sweezy without due process because the mandate of the legislature in that case was too vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.678" offset="9446066">Since seven members of this Court have stated the arguments on both sides better than I could and certainly more persuasively than I could, I see no reason to add anything on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.803" offset="9494549">It would in respect to the two members of the Court who will read those opinions and who were not participative --</text>

            <text syncTime="2414.909" offset="9762983">That in 1957 the legislature or General Court of New Hampshire passed a resolution stating with respect to Dr. Sweezy that this Court was wrong in connection with the last point that I made about what the legislature of New Hampshire wanted with respect to Dr. Sweezy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.832" offset="9834663">And that in fact the legislature wanted exactly what Mr. Wyman has said it wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.820" offset="9854621">Now after that, I think it is sufficient to say that the resolution related specifically to Dr. Sweezy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.268" offset="9880430">It was not considered by this Court sufficient to overturn the decision in Dr. Sweezy's case when it was presented to it upon rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.505" offset="9917419">Thirdly, that of course the resolution passed in 1957 could hardly affect our right in 1955 and 1956 and the earlier 1957 at the time of the -- the times of the alleged contempt and the original decisions of the State of New Hampshire.</text>

            <text syncTime="2492.512" offset="10073422">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.680" offset="10090141">I am very happy and grateful to have the opportunity at this time to be able to argue this case, because particularly of the argument that has been made to date in respect to the meaning and significance of some of these earlier decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.034" offset="10175509">It is been said here that we're out of business in New Hampshire as a state investigation of subversive activities because of the Steve Nelson decision and the Sweezy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.457" offset="10225246">I don't believe, most respectfully, that this Court has ever held that to be the law.But at this point, this is a very simple case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.173" offset="10276028">What is before the Court here is a subpoena duces tecum to Willard Uphaus asking him to produce two things which he refuses to produce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.340" offset="10324720">Not for the reason of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.284" offset="10336528">Not for reason of any claim at all, except as he says, for reason of conscience and for technical reasons assigned by counsel, First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, Sixth Amendment and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.611" offset="10401834">No Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.703" offset="10414164">Now, what was he called for?</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.515" offset="10425448">The first thing was his guest list at World Fellowship Incorporated, which is a summer camp in New Hampshire to which people come from many parts of the United States and concerning which considerable facts were unavoidably set forth to the legislature of New Hampshire in a required report which was submitted to the General Court on January 5th, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.746" offset="10554389">In his argument just now, Mr. France just said that he'd like to have this report in the record printed as an appendix to their reply brief is a statement that they don't consent to it, but will raise no formal objection because of the fact that they didn't consent to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.220" offset="10636204">We brought 40 copies here with us simply for the reason that we believe that it is impossible to adequately assess the full record of this case and to determine whether the questions that are asked of Dr. Uphaus in which he declines to answer in this case are relevant without examining this report which antedates the proceeding which is now before this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.147" offset="10767966">I would like to the second class of information that's asked for here by the subpoenas is for correspondence between Uphaus and speakers who came to World Fellowship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.157" offset="10832018">On this -- without going into the page references in the record, there were some 20 speakers with whom he had correspondence and that correspondence is in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.954" offset="10879143">It is in New Haven, Connecticut and the guest registers which are asked for by the subpoena are in existence for the two years, not forever, but just for 1954 and 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.047" offset="10935568">They're in existence on 355 (Inaudible) in New Haven, Connecticut and there were about 300 or maybe 400 guests in each of the two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.004" offset="10975378">That's all that this case is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.773" offset="10990425">Now, as against the request of the legislature of New Hampshire, not of the Attorney General, this is a legislative committee of one which has been approved as a procedure and practice in my State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.901" offset="11046954">And as to which this Court held of such approval to be binding and of no concern here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.970" offset="11079241">This committee was the Attorney General for the General Court because they didn't want a committee of politicians to be conducting this kind of investigation in New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.191" offset="11132113">And this committee has operated in this case as in all other cases under rules of procedure which are printed up in the appendix to the brief, and which are ultimately fair, which were approved in substance by the House of Delegates of the American Bar Association and has at all times good witnesses in executive session including Dr. Uphaus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.280" offset="11236498">That executive session incidentally consisted of having the witness and this counsel come into one room, a private room without anybody being there at all except possibly myself or one or two Assistant Attorneys General or a -- an investigator, the witness and this counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.689" offset="11314134">And if the transcripts which are printed, some of which are printed in the transcript of record in this case, are examined by this Court, I am sure that you will find that at all times the exchanges between counsel and the witness and the committee were both courteous and restrained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.667" offset="11389994">So that at this time, what does this case involve for this Court as an issue as the fundamental gravamen to use Dr. France's language.</text>

            <text syncTime="2940.959" offset="11867199">The full report is three or four times this size.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.462" offset="11881200">And at this time, if it's of any significance, I would like to say that 90% of the names of witnesses that were -- that testified in the executive session in the investigation of subversive activities in New Hampshire had never been published.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.455" offset="11945148">They did not appear in this report and it is then our policy in accordance with the rules of procedures not to do that whenever we can avoid it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.159" offset="11980048">But we do have this statute in New Hampshire which requires that when a witness declines to answer, that the committee can do nothing about it and they must transfer the matter to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.278" offset="12024456">And then, before the Court they have a full hearing, to determine whether or not the questions are relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.699" offset="12050160">Whether or not the -- the statute under which the questions of course is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.778" offset="12070536">And after the Court makes that determination one way or the other, the case is decided under the aegis of the judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.980" offset="12103241">I think it's of some importance to mention the fact about names because the implication of the argument in appellant's brief is that if the names of the guests are produced in accordance with the subpoena, that we will immediately proceed to the report under the legislature of subversive persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.976" offset="12183280">Which I assure to you, on my professional word, will not be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.195" offset="12204178">We do feel, however, that the guest names have some relevance that there may have been many of them who were or are members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.299" offset="12240541">And that in any fact finding investigation, that it is our responsibility and duty in order to try to find out whether there was advocacy of violent overthrow or that kind of incitement to action referred to as a limitation under the Smith Act and hence, applicable to that aspect of the New Hampshire's -- the subversive activities act by Yates versus U.S. held by this Court whether that existed at World Fellowship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.537" offset="12361540">You see, there are two things here that are really the job of the committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.798" offset="12386513">One, is Willard Uphaus a subversive person?</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.142" offset="12399992">That's one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.365" offset="12404799">The second is, and this is perhaps more important, is World Fellowship incorporated a bona fide place in which people come for the purposes of dissent and argument, and discussion of controversial matters all within the limitations of freedom of speech?</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.532" offset="12473448">Or, is it a place where they come to hatch a plot to overthrow the Government of the State of New Hampshire?</text>

            <text syncTime="3161.017" offset="12747421">I think a part of the grip in my argument today and the feeling that I have then was that as things now stand, all the witness has to do today to avoid a contempt charge is to refuse to answer and cite Sweezy and Watkins and perhaps Yates and we're in doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.313" offset="12820668">We don't know whether he has to answer or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.292" offset="12832580">Now, we feel that the Watkins case in this particular cause which is here is inapplicable, because we don't think we have a vague resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.402" offset="12868942">We think that this Court in effect in Watkins told the Congress of the United States, "Rewrite your resolution empowering your un-American activities and your internal security subcommittee, empowering them to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.518" offset="12925471">Rewrite it so that we'll know and can pass as a judicial act upon what un-American activities means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.218" offset="12964237">Or, we will be unable to determine whether a particular question is relevant to the line of inquiry which you are now taking.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.133" offset="12991927">But in New Hampshire, we have an Act which was very carefully written by a Frank Ober of the Maryland bar and has been patterned in the many states in this country known as the Ober Act, in which subversive activity is defined very clearly to require a scienter with intentional advocacy of the overthrow of the Government of the State of New Hampshire by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.701" offset="13090147">And to require of an organization before it can be held to be subversive that it shall have and be found to have as one of its purposes, the overthrow of the Government of the State or any political subdivision thereof by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.903" offset="13150960">And I say the State because as we see it in the Steve Nelson decision of that portion of the New Hampshire law which said the Government of the United States or the State of New Hampshire, that portion which dealt with the Government of the United States has been struck out insofar at least as the capacity of the State of New Hampshire to constitute this concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.574" offset="13237687">We don't believe that this Court struck out from the statute, that section of -- of the statute which said that New Hampshire may make it a crime to conspire or to advocate or to teach the propriety of the overthrow of the Government of the State of New Hampshire within its borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.348" offset="13304769">And there, perhaps raises the question and a very important one, what happens when someone takes the position that the web and fabric of the statutory restrictions on this type of activity are all directed at the International Communist Movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.688" offset="13374151">What happens when the -- when it is said that advocacy of the overthrow of the Government of the United States unavoidably involves, advocacy of the overthrow of the Government of the State of New Hampshire (Inaudible) in California, and there, we cannot answer that except to say that we hope that this Court will read carefully the opinion of the Supreme Court of New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.392" offset="13472893">In this case, where it said we're concerned and we find the legislature's concern is valid about overthrow of the Government of the State of New Hampshire and we believe that it cannot be found that the legislature did not have a genuine concern to know whether there were people at World Fellowship, Inc. that were conspiring to overthrow the Government of New Hampshire.</text>

            <text syncTime="5935.548" offset="23845595">-- to refer the one thing here that at pages 17, 39, 40, 43, 51, 72, and 74 of the first transcript of Dr. Uphaus' testimony, there are -- it mentioned a number of individuals and whom he recognizes as present or former members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="5954.128" offset="23919888">In the question of the preemption, we take the position simply that the New Hampshire statute which is patterned on the overact is saved by a Separability Clause, that this Court in the purpose to its opinion in the Steve Nelson decision when the Chief Justice spoke, he said this case -- the instant case is concerned only with sedition against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5979.947" offset="24023124">We believe that there was never in the Steve Nelson case intended by this Court to outlaw those provisions of state statutes which prohibited -- attempted to regulate sedition against the State Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5992.669" offset="24074010">Our statute very clearly and it's printed as an appendix both to the report and to the brief and to the plaintiff's jurisdictional statement contains a Separability Clause which strikes out from the Subversive Activities Law in New Hampshire, now, the United States or any political subdivision thereof in the light of the Steve Nelson decision and in such in place thereof, the State of New Hampshire which is already in there and continues in there by a virtue of the Separability Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="6022.446" offset="24193128">That we believe gives us full authority to legislate in that field or to amend.</text>
            <text syncTime="6028.624" offset="24217893">But we take the position here, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, that we have the power to investigate as distinct from to legislate whether or not the provision relating to the United States Government is superseded by the Steve Nelson decision until and unless Congress acts otherwise that being the case, there was language in the Steve Nelson opinion which indicated that the states sedition statutes were merely suspended in there enforceability.</text>
            <text syncTime="6058.505" offset="24337429">Now, I don't know whether by that the Court meant that they were off the books completely or they were to continue on the books until such time as Congress either amended the Smith Act or removed it entirely from the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="6072.359" offset="24392808">But if this --</text>

            <text syncTime="6075.933" offset="24407124">In -- in this situation, by that provision, it's very clear that whether the enforceability was suspended or not, that a committee may investigate in aid of legislation, even though that legislation if ultimately enacted might be unconstitutional or might be in the field in which they could only be in a standby status.</text>
            <text syncTime="6103.111" offset="24515793">But, it's very clear that legislation designed to protect the security and sovereignty and integrity of the State is not struck down by the Steve Nelson decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="6114.676" offset="24562082">And we believe that the Tenth Amendment, in fact, would reserve such a power to the state governments in any event although recognizing that arguments can be made on both sides of that proposition.</text>

            <text syncTime="6255.424" offset="25125073">If the Court, please.</text>
            <text syncTime="6256.508" offset="25129357">With all due respect to the Attorney General of New Hampshire, I find myself somewhat amazed by certain statements that he has made.</text>
            <text syncTime="6265.898" offset="25166973">How he could say that a man like Willard Uphaus who appeared before him and then told him everything about his beliefs, his conscientious beliefs, his own activities or he could say he was a bogus is beyond my comprehension.</text>
            <text syncTime="6280.713" offset="25226219">On page 23 of the record in this case, the Methodist Minister under whom he served for eight years said, "During the eight years or so that I served as his pastor, I can truthfully and humbly state that I have never had a more consecrated or self-sacrificing layman in Willard Uphaus.</text>
            <text syncTime="6300.750" offset="25306363">He was on call for deeds of kindness and mercy, a veritable (Inaudible) whenever I as pastor called on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="6307.166" offset="25332067">Anyone who dares -- anyone who dares say that he uses religion, his religion as a cover-up for his social concern is a liar and the truth is not in him.</text>
            <text syncTime="6319.215" offset="25380237">I wish the Christian Church had 100 men as deeply spiritual and devoted as Willard Uphaus.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6325.651" offset="25405942">And similar tributes are paid by the two other pastors of the Methodist Church under whom he has served as a layman.</text>
            <text syncTime="6334.293" offset="25440528">A second thing that I'm amazed at is that the Attorney General says that he would not give the names that he obtained in such an investigation, but he has given them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6344.943" offset="25483160">Willard Uphaus was clearly right when he was reluctant to give these names to the Attorney General because here they are published in a report to the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="6356.391" offset="25528926">And on page 165 -- 155 of this report are listed the names of people who were representatives from foreign governments, preachers, college professors without any indication why they're listed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6372.387" offset="25592874">And yet, under the parlance of today, these men had been cited in New Hampshire and the Attorney General in the proceedings admitted that there's a -- a list, a card index exchanged between the 37 Attorney Generals throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6389.858" offset="25662777">And these people coming here to register, at a public camp where nothing was concealed, where the Attorney General was personally welcome to camp and I think perhaps did have a representative because I don't know how else he knew about that little incident about the “God Bless the Revolution.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6409.440" offset="25741145">This camp which was open to everybody and not at all conspiratorial in its nature, the names of these people that he wants to give so that they may be circulated are cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="6422.894" offset="25794957">And Willard Uphaus says, “I have been moved first by my religious convictions, by my inner conscience, by the direct teachings of the Bible that it's wrong to bear false witness against my neighbor.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6436.927" offset="25851068">I am also completely at a lost as to why the Communist Party is continually brought into the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="6445.097" offset="25883773">It is not a fact to me, Your Honors will find it not to be the fact from the reading of the record that anybody who was ever -- who is -- was shown to be a Communist was present and certainly Willard Uphaus testified that there was nothing taught there about the overthrow of Government by force and violence, not even about Marxism that they talked about peace and about social problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="6472.209" offset="25992234">And the Attorney General tries to distinguish the decision in Sweezy on very narrow grounds.Mr. Justice Frankfurter wrote an opinion stating the importance of academic freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="6485.494" offset="26045315">And the Attorney General would limit that to something in a university, but academic freedom is -- he speaks of in a psychotic sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="6494.919" offset="26083035">This was a camp where the adult education was carried on.</text>
