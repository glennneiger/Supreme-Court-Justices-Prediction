            <text syncTime="316.136" offset="1367960">In other words, there is no such trade exclusivity in interstate commerce or so on or domestic.</text>

            <text syncTime="342.305" offset="1472554">In other words, to answer in part to your question, that is when our Court said that -- they said this is an excise tax, they say just that, they say it's in the nature of an excise tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.659" offset="1537964">But now I say that they were not there giving a ruling or judgment of law as a matter of statutory construction, but they were there making a rule constitutional law, and as such were merely acting as an inferior court to this Court because this is the court that gives us those judgments with regard to constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.437" offset="1637125">Therefore, when they said, as in effect they said, that an income tax is a franchise tax, they were ruling not as a matter of statutory construction with regard to our legislature's intent, they were saying irrespective of legislative intent, per se, constitutionally per se, that this is a franchise tax, and that, when they said that they were operating just as an inferior federal court and we are now here to get the last authority ruling with regards to whether or not an income tax is per se a franchise tax.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ben F. Johnson</label>
            <text syncTime="549.691" offset="2302098">That's right, in this regard and I think I would like to finish that about that statute and I'll get to those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.982" offset="2351313">And I would like to say this -- this other there because it'll help us to sort of bring this thing along.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.359" offset="2376808">First the point I wanted to make is the Georgia statute taxes the income of domestic foreign corporations alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.584" offset="2405752">There is no question of discrimination about it in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.323" offset="2420694">They make no claim of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.436" offset="2429158">The next thing I'd like to say, and this is according to our Supreme Court, the Georgia statute purports to tax only the income derived from sources within the state, but it has no purpose to tax income from sources outside the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.266" offset="2516407">And in order to do this it sets up a three fact formula, which is based on inventories, payroll and gross receipts.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.152" offset="2563950">Now that's not all that might be used, that's the statutory formula and the Commissioner has authority to develop any other formula that more closely fits the particular facts of a particular case in order to bring about a fairer allocation, a fairer, a factor which more measure best than these passed upon the facts to fit the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.650" offset="2670007">Now Stockham makes no claim in this case that – that their formula which was used in this case, taxed as income which was derived from sources outside of Georgia, except with regard to what was done at the home office there.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.353" offset="2768750">Now, let me put that a little bit different.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.002" offset="2775333">We will see in a minute that this -- that these sale representatives in Georgia, traveling Georgia and in North Carolina and South Carolina and Florida, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.225" offset="2816293">Now they are not saying at all that we are tying to tax income, derived from income producing efforts in North Carolina or South Carolina or Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.142" offset="2867911">They do of course say that we are trying to tax income which is derived in Alabama, because that's where the home office is, and that's where these contracts are accepted and the credit and so on, we will get back to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.155" offset="2924022">In 1950, our income tax statute was amended to add this.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.890" offset="2958921">Every such corporation, that's in with respect of foreign domestic corporations, that's right in behind that section, shall be deemed to be doing business within the state that engages within that state in any activities or transactions for the purpose of financial profit or gain, whether or not, such corporation qualifies to do business in this state, whether or not it maintains an office or place of doing business within a state, and whether or not such activity or transaction is connected with interstate or foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.422" offset="3097057">Now that amendment, part of that amendment, the Georgia court had held, that our statute did not intend, as a matter of statutory construction, did not intend to tax income derived from exclusively interstate commerce, but from sources or activities in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.437" offset="3177096">So the purpose of this amendment is to exhaust the state's constitutional power to tax income from Georgia sources, including income from exclusively interstate and foreign commerce, which is carried on within the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="814.634" offset="3361938">Its main office was in Birmingham.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.603" offset="3369775">Its factory, it's only manufacturing plant was in Birmingham.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.256" offset="3396420">It had an established scheme of distribution and that's scheme was this, in four cities, other than Birmingham, it had warehouses and another seven -- these of course were strategically located all over the United States, in another seven cities strategically located over the United States, they had what are called sales, service offices.</text>

            <text syncTime="857.255" offset="3532361">Offices, yes offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.165" offset="3548035">Now then, I want to put this in, all orders which were received or accepted at the home office in Birmingham, and all shipments were remade FOB warehouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.097" offset="3631731">Now then, I want to point out the differences in the Northwestern case, in so far as the facts are concerned, and then I'll -- because that's fresh in mind and I -- There are three main differences here, between our case, start from the statute, on the facts there are three main differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.632" offset="3725876">First is that Northwestern had two salesmen and a secretary which was operating out of its Minneapolis -- which was operating in, I should say and in and out I guess out of its Minneapolis office.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.393" offset="3788988">And there were one to three owners that were operating in the state of Minnesota but not operating out of this office, they were operating of their home that's in Northwestern.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.365" offset="3824828">Our case we had -- they had only one full time sales service representative that was stationed so to speak in this Atlanta office and then they had a full time secretary there and that's -- a difference in personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.291" offset="3904554">They had more personnel there than we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.311" offset="3920645">Second is that their -- these operators, salesmen whatever you call them, were confined to Minnesota whereas the sales service representative in Georgia also traveled in some in the surrounding states and the record shows that that in this he spent about two-third of his time traveling to these other states and about one-third of his time in the Atlanta office.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.932" offset="4039137">The third difference is the volume of business, the volume of business which Northwestern got out of Minnesota went up to 48% of its total sales, but in our case it was only 1% to 2%, but in dollar terms that was a $150,000 to $300,000 worth of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.715" offset="4122206">Now then as regards to due process, because I have got to show in order to win this case, I have got to show that these activities, I won't call them local activities, these activities that took place in Georgia, even though they were wholly pursuant to interstate commerce, I have go to show that they were substantially enough to have received some of the opportunities and the benefits and the protections of the State of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.058" offset="4279568">Now then let me -- I'll say that that these differences that I have given you are really not material differences, because we think it is the quality of what Stockham was doing, the quality of Stockham's establishment in Georgia and not the measurable aspects of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.675" offset="4378102">I can illustrate that pretty simple, from the Northwestern's case if you notice that one year they only have $10 tax and for the 10 -- this is Northwestern, $10 tax and for the preceding 10 years that tax had run up to $8000 and for five years after that it again went up to $7000 or $8000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.222" offset="4468276">I don't know why that happened, but it could have happened because they didn't have much sales, but the record shows that its establishment was the same all during that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.001" offset="4523342">Now you could take another illustration as I pointed out, Stockham we have three years involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.140" offset="4547897">The first year they had about a $150,000 of sales, the third year they had $300,000 which was about double.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.263" offset="4584469">If it's a quantitative thing at what point, and we are talking about jurisdiction to tax, at what point does jurisdiction of tax if it's a quantitative thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.135" offset="4631907">So I say it's a qualitative thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.325" offset="4644655">Now I like to say a bit about what we are not talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.418" offset="4669001">$300,000 of sales can be gotten out of Georgia on a number of different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.523" offset="4701497">They could have gotten $300,000 of sales out of Georgia by mail order business and we are not talking about mail order business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.617" offset="4741831">They could have had an occasional traveling salesman, go through there, and he may have been a good salesman and gotten $300,000 worth of business and we are not talking about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.371" offset="4796897">As a matter of fact they may have had a proof of these traveling salesmen operating out of Birmingham and getting in there fairly regularly, but we are not talking about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.998" offset="4847365">They may have even had an office in Atlanta, and this crew of traveling salesman may have used that office as a sort of mail drop, but we are not talking about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.883" offset="4894908">So the question is what is the quality of Stockham's establishment in Atlanta?</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.142" offset="4927927">Now when we speak to this, I think we are looking at the nature of what went on there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.050" offset="4951542">It's substance that causal relationship between the activities that went on there and in these seven other places and the relationship of all of that is total activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.501" offset="5013400">And I might say here that we are not talking about how Stockham might have acted, I mean how close it might have acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.716" offset="5054255">I mean, instead of being expansive, it could have acted -- stayed at home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.217" offset="5092289">Well we talk about how they did that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.749" offset="5110366">Now it is a fact in the record the Stockham had an office in Atlanta and this office was publicized as the office, as the Atlanta office of Stockham.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.055" offset="5175568">They were listed in the telephone book.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.815" offset="5186644">They were listed in the classified section under the (Inaudible) in city.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.724" offset="5210258">They were -- they sent out their letterheads and said that they had seven of these offices throughout the country and Atlanta was one of them and it was in all their literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.548" offset="5265533">Now it was there as a part of a designed system of distribution, it was there permanently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.082" offset="5307747">It was there day to date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.981" offset="5315271">It was there year in year out since 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.726" offset="5330317">It was there, it was not there temporarily, it was not there transiently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.647" offset="5353932">It was there to compete with its competitors as the record says many of whom had inventory stocked of these very same goods in Atlanta.</text>

            <text syncTime="1395.645" offset="5686000">What I am saying is that, it was there to compete with competitors who were on the spot with their goods.</text>

            <text syncTime="1418.407" offset="5777011">Now let's see it another way; Stockham had no hold on its market through patterns on its products.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.070" offset="5823613">It had no hold on its market through national advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.279" offset="5844511">It had no hold on these local wholesalers and jobbers by reason of exclusive dealership arrangement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1453.769" offset="5918490">Some of them as I said, had warehouse stocked right there in Atlanta.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.786" offset="5942523">Its customers were independent wholesalers, independent wholesalers and jobbers who were free to buy or not to buy, to stock these goods or not to stock them, to push or not to push them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.337" offset="5996753">They were free to deal in competitive products and the record shows that their customers did carry one or more competing lines of the identical partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.471" offset="6057253">The record also shows that Stockham did not seek to compete by price cut.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.101" offset="6083793">Now that's what I call a competitive and fluid, if you get what I mean, it was a fluid condition, a fluid market condition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1602.690" offset="6514082">These -- and in some detail, I hesitate to repeat, but it is fell out in considerable detail what they were there to do with regard to their customers and with regard to prospective customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.450" offset="6585135">They were not at all instruments of emphasizing their good service and selling their good service but they were instruments of furnishing the service.</text>

            <text syncTime="1739.117" offset="7059832">Now this business of development a local demand, these local representatives were the chief actors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.342" offset="7096717">They could talk the technical language of architect and engineers and this is in the record and they could advise with them and pass on technical ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.104" offset="7159829">After all it's the architect who writes up the specification and can specify Stockham products and therefore can control the products, which is going in to these businesses.</text>
