            <text syncTime="53.198" offset="316165">Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.111" offset="339780">A product of the life insurance industry is insurance because it assumes and distributes an insurable risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.379" offset="368933">This is as true of the variable annuity as it is -- as it is true of any insurance policy issued by any company.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.413" offset="401011">The insurable risk in the variable annuity is the risk of excessive longevity.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.323" offset="424626">As the Court of Appeal's said, “If everyone were to die at the time predicted by a mortality table, there would be no use in paying an insurance company to dollar out one's funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.588" offset="469765">However, no one knows when he will die and the insurance product which guarantees him an income for life, regardless of how long that life may be is the annuity.”</text>
            <text syncTime="102.627" offset="513860">And investment risk on the other hand is not an insurable risk and whether annuity payments vary with investment experience has nothing to do with whether or not they are annuities.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.236" offset="560358">A variable annuity is an annuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.384" offset="572897">This fact has been determined by the Insurance Superintendent and legal authorities of the District of Columbia and several States.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.862" offset="602781">This fact was agreed to by all expert insurance witnesses testifying at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.203" offset="624201">This fact is agreed to by the three leading authors of life insurance textbooks.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.237" offset="644368">This fact has been agreed too by the two courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.488" offset="657324">This fact has been accepted by the Internal Revenue Service which classifies a variable annuity as an annuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.353" offset="684805">This fact finally was accepted by petitioners when they did not challenge Finding of Fact Number 30 made by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.424" offset="717093">Finding of Fact 30 which is in the recorded at page 100 says that a variable annuity issued by these respondents is an annuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.152" offset="755963">A variable annuity is an annuity because it, like all other annuities and unlike any other economic device, provides a lifetime income over the life span of a group of annuitants in accordance with scientific actuarial principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.047" offset="815522">The Securities and Exchange Commission concede this is the proper definition of an annuity that states that whether or not an annuity shall be regulated by the Commission depends upon the degree of investment risk born by the individual policy holder.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.327" offset="876648">Variable annuities which assume no investment risk have been available for years for persons in the teaching profession and for the benefit of many large corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.695" offset="914160">The College Retirement Equities Fund has made variable annuities available to many thousands of teachers and professors in the United States without challenge from the Securities and Exchange Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.844" offset="958777">The immediate participation guaranteed annuity which guarantees no investment assumption to the policy holder is sold by many of the best known life insurance companies in the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="267.926" offset="1175071">I think the number of teachers covered is now in excess of 40,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.045" offset="1199522">Historically, Mr. Carnegie decided that many teachers in the United States were not adequately compensated in their retirement period.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.166" offset="1240064">Consequently, around about the end of World War I, the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association was founded in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.685" offset="1266082">This association called TIAA paid fixed dollar annuities to teachers and professors in the United States that wanted to participate by the universities in this plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.644" offset="1313938">During the period of the 1920s and 1930s, they found that many teachers and professors had been reduced to gentile poverty because the fixed dollar payments were insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.051" offset="1355525">Therefore, Mr. Carnegie came along and gave them some more money.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.162" offset="1368064">And subsequent to that time, they decided that there was no reason why and the legislature of the State of New York agreed with them that a companion corporation called the College Retirement Equities Fund could not be set up.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.313" offset="1416652">Now, what a teacher, who elects to participate in this plan, receives today is one half of these premiums that are put into a fixed dollar annuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.962" offset="1447267">That's called the TIAA.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.601" offset="1453746">The other half is put into a variable annuity, which is called the College Retirement Equities Fund -- Equities Fund or CREF.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.732" offset="1482271">The distinguishable element between the variable annuity sold by these respondents and the TIAA-CREF plan is that in that plan, you must have both simultaneously, that is you must have a fixed dollar annuity and a variable annuity if you so desire.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.085" offset="1547682">You may not have the variable annuity without the fixed dollar annuity.</text>

            <text syncTime="695.487" offset="2885360">It is not seriously questioned that only a life insurance company may issue a variable annuity policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.592" offset="2909706">The Securities and Exchange Commission has based its plea for regulation of respondents on two premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.263" offset="2932381">First, that the extent of the investment risk borne by an individual policy holder determines whether or not an annuity is also a security.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.436" offset="2965086">In its reply brief, the Commission says, at the foot of page 3, we do not contend that the purchaser of traditional insurance assumes no investment risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.847" offset="3002807">Our contention is that Congress presumably thought that that risk was of such a comparatively minor character particularly in view of state regulation that there would be no need to require compliance with the federal securities law.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.490" offset="3057351">As to the investment risk, I believe it is clear that the degree of investment risk assumed, which is not an insurable risk, has nothing to do with the question of whether a particular annuity should be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.566" offset="3117641">Congress intended that all annuity should be regulated solely by the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.138" offset="3135927">Second, the Securities and Exchange Commission says that the public is not adequately protected from many possible abuses in the sale of variable annuities despite regulations of the District of Columbia and several States.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.480" offset="3189321">This statement is simply incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.077" offset="3199666">Life insurance regulation commences prior to the formation of a company and last until each and every obligation of the company to its policy holders has been discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.034" offset="3239476">It has been said that the business of life insurance is more regulated than any other business activity not a public utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.831" offset="3266748">Insurance regulation is not solely of the disclosure variety, but is predicated on the assumption that the only way in which the public can be adequately protected by -- through regulations so stringent that will ensure the fairness of every policy issued and every practice followed by the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.159" offset="3332054">In the District of Columbia, the Superintendent of Insurance even has the authority to refuse to renew an annual license to an insurance company if he believe such renewal of license would adversely effect the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.838" offset="3382732">Petitioner as in the accident and health cases does not argue that these statutes are mere pretense.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.686" offset="3406137">Petitioner's argument is the possibilities of abuse are inherit in sales of these contracts, while the same could be said of any policy of life insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.460" offset="3441246">The real question is with regard to all such contracts, what agency shall protect the public from the possibility of abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.128" offset="3471862">In the field of life insurance, the answer is now as it has been for generations.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.339" offset="3488684">The state legislatures and state insurance supervisors shall protect the public in the public interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2747.979" offset="11095333">This variable annuity, if you cut through everything else, is nothing but a life annuity contract issued by an insurance company that -- that provides completely for participation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.556" offset="11165550">Now, the difference is, and the -- and the -- really the sole difference is that the participating annuity contains a nominal minimum payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.985" offset="11215287">That nominal minimum payment is based upon an assumed interest rate of 2% to 2.5%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.390" offset="11248933">We have set forth in our brief the history of that development largely from SEC sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.296" offset="11276518">Prior to 1935, the insurance companies were assuming a larger amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.166" offset="11303999">About 1930, and along in that period, the insurance companies discovered two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.776" offset="11338480">They discovered people were living longer, which was a delightful discovery from the standpoint of life insurance, but which involves certain risks from the standpoint of annuities which had been based upon actuarial studies as to when the group would die.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.302" offset="11412564">And they found also that the investment assumptions they were making were excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.607" offset="11445791">This is all set forth in TNEC Monograph 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.688" offset="11466167">The net result of those two factors was to put pressure on the life insurance annuity business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.454" offset="11493230">Not only were people living longer, but the assumptions which they had made as to earnings were proving too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.912" offset="11531055">They solved, we hope, because if they haven't, 50 years from now, we shall have certain troubles, they solved the mortality problem by a series of new mortality tables.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.473" offset="11581315">The SEC expert testified that in the past 70 years, there had been a whole series of new mortality tables.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.856" offset="11610781">Each one taking into account the fact that we do live longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.183" offset="11632097">They solved the investment problem by -- and this is SEC itself saying it in TNEC Monograph, by reducing the assumed interest rate to 2% or 2.5%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.410" offset="11696985">Now, in the past 50 years, there have been only three years in which the insurance companies overall have made less than 3%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.357" offset="11744841">The average interest rate -- and as the NASD has explained to us, interest rate in the insurance world means the investment earnings, whether from rents, dividends or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.706" offset="11802206">The average interest rate has been about 4% and they took care of the -- of the whole situation by putting in this nominal minimum, which was so low that only a catastrophe could ever reduce the company to it, and providing for participation in the excess earnings to that dividends to participating policyholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.929" offset="11891127">Now, that is precisely what this man buys.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.048" offset="11907532">When he is 35, and we have used him for an example, and we have given these figures on page 19 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.299" offset="11972524">We take a 35-year-old man as the most logical candidate for a deferred annuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.236" offset="12008364">And we start from the rate book, which is in evidence, and is plaintiff's Exhibit 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.213" offset="12052250">And the page in question, if we could just take one second to look at this, we -- we will have the answer to what the man gets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.805" offset="12082552">The page in question is record 619.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.573" offset="12129677">He is 35 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.277" offset="12136469">He's a very prosperous man, I presume, because he decides he will pay $1000 annual premium, and he will take a policy that will provide him for his retirement -- provide for his retirement when he is 65.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.231" offset="12208253">He pays $30,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.159" offset="12231973">On page 618, the top line is annuity premium without waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.704" offset="12254229">I'm using 10 times those figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.117" offset="12267813">Now, if he had wanted to have a waiver of premium in the event of his total disability, instead of $1000, he would have paid $1035.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.131" offset="12323924">That's about five lines down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.555" offset="12337612">For the extra $35, he would have no one that should he become disabled anytime in the next 30 years, the company would waive his premiums, that is it would be made up from the other reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.418" offset="12397066">The SEC concede that is strictly an insurance function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.447" offset="12421204">Now, in addition, if he were insurable physically, he would have been required to have a minimum of life insurance in this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.658" offset="12461955">Why that minimum?</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.242" offset="12472299">For obvious reasons, I think it provides a protection during the early years of the policy when, as in all life insurance business, the expenses tend to center.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.707" offset="12518170">All life insurance is based on what is called the acquisition cost which is higher in the first years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.487" offset="12541367">And so, he -- if he is insurable, we say you must have enough life insurance for the first five years to know that you have in case of catastrophe and death, you are protected there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.765" offset="12586402">He may take more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.755" offset="12594343">We have a family protection policy without top limit, which has been approved by the Insurance Commissioner and which will carry him insured without reduction until he is 65.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.699" offset="12638124">But let's set that aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.791" offset="12650559">Now, the total premium for his five years of reducing time life insurance is only $105.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.977" offset="12679293">That has been according to the actuaries of the SEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.960" offset="12699251">That is a perfectly normal premium.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.229" offset="12724328">In the -- on page 618 in the lower right-hand corner, there is a table which shows the percentage of basic annuity premium which is applied to provide the deferred annuity benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.800" offset="12782529">And with life insurance, the first year is 46.07% and without life insurance, it's 48%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.817" offset="12814608">The next year, it jumps to 88% and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.454" offset="12829236">Now, the difference between the 46.07% and the 48% is the life insurance premium.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.035" offset="12855463">That's where we get our life insurance premium, by that small percentage difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.480" offset="12877302">Now, when you calculate out the percentages, which you applied, and when this man approaches 65, he has paid $30,000 of that amount, $26,745 has been allocated to the reserve for his policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.745" offset="12958386">He has, at that point, if there was zero adjustment on his policy, $26,745.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.752" offset="12990360">$105 were used for his life insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.084" offset="13007705">$600 is the average amount of state taxation on this form of thrift.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.353" offset="13032782">The SEC expert told us that the average premium tax is 2%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.763" offset="13054412">And that leaves $2550 of his $30,000 of premiums, which has gone to this company against its expenses, its contingencies and perhaps, its profits, if it makes any.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.120" offset="13119822">Now, during the period when he has been accumulating this $26,745, the only difference between this policy and any annuity which anyone else has, is that the company adjust the -- the old annuity adjust by an assumed rate which was 2%, and perhaps, adds to what it calls your cash value the -- from excess interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.724" offset="13250226">When he reaches 65, he, like anyone else, has a cash value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.079" offset="13279692">And we have shown from the record in our brief, a comparison of the accumulated cash values of a VALIC policy on the assumption we make 3.5% interest, a Lincoln National Life Insurance Company -- where is that thing -- and a Canada Life Insurance Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.608" offset="13369762">The latter two companies are all lined companies and the only thing we have done is take the cash value which is provided in that policy of this and add to it the amount that that cash value would be increased by their continuing participation at -- at the present rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.453" offset="13449174">That table is summarized on page 13 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.511" offset="13469445">This man becomes 64.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.902" offset="13487000">He then loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.168" offset="13492015">He has cancer, and he is going to die in five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.254" offset="13520436">West Virginia says, “We cannot issue one of these policies,” it's in the regulations I pointed out, “unless we provide that he has the option to take his cash value before entering on his annuity”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.383" offset="13576861">The District of Columbia has the same provision in essence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.565" offset="13593684">At that point, before he becomes an annuitant in this policy as in any other policy, if there is some contingency in his life, he may take his cash value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.499" offset="13645406">But if he does not, if he stands tough, we have no option, that they -- that we issue this policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.144" offset="13679992">We have agreed that when this man becomes 65, unless he exercises an option, we will begin to pay him an annuity which will run for his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.912" offset="13727013">Now, in this assumption, we have a man with $46,900 of cash value.</text>

            <text syncTime="4328.577" offset="17417697">Then during the trial, when this whole obsolete sales kit was offered in evidence, I objected.</text>
            <text syncTime="4344.022" offset="17479450">And at page 620 of the original transcript of the proceedings in the lower court, likewise before this Court, but not printed, and I neglected to make one statement and the deposition of the witness Marsh (ph) clearly shows it that the old sales kit was identified in the depositions as Exhibit Number 9, whereas when it was offered in evidence, it became 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="4372.131" offset="17591881">And so I ask this question or request this stipulation after I objected to the introduction of plaintiff's 21, I'm reading from page 620, “I would request Mr. Feldman, he was the Chief Trial Attorney for SEC, to stipulate what appears in the depositions in respect to plaintiff's Exhibit Number 21, which was identified in the deposition as Exhibit 9, namely that this was the first so-called sales kit of VALIC, that it was shown to a limited number of people, as I recall not, exceeding 50, that it very soon became apparent to VALIC that it was impertinent and could be considerably improved upon, and that it was discontinued only after having been subjected to a very limited use, that it is not now used and has not been used."</text>
            <text syncTime="4424.280" offset="17800443">Mr. Feldman responded, “I will stipulate that it was shown to a number of people not exceeding 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="4431.065" offset="17827610">I will further stipulate that it is not now being used.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4434.941" offset="17843179">And so while the purpose of drawing this comparison, it was rather obscure to me, at least it is wholly based upon something which we did not use, haven't -- we're not using at the time of the institution of this lawsuit.</text>
