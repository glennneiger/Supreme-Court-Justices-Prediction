            <text syncTime="19.891" offset="182941">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.975" offset="195271">This case is before the Court on the certiorari granted for the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.482" offset="221288">A judgment of the Court of Appeals reversed the action of the District Court, sitting at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which had sustained a motion by the County of Allegheny to dismiss the complaint filed by the respondents who were the plaintiffs below.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.610" offset="293804">Now the Creasy case which was heard just before this case discussed the question of a road leading to the airport, which takes us right to the airport itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.485" offset="345318">The plaintiffs complained below, and had alleged that the County of Allegheny had taken their property, purportedly for airport purposes, but in fact there was a taking for a private purpose, and that since it was not a public purpose that taking was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.249" offset="420342">They, therefore, asked for the following relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.229" offset="448240">Plaintiff stated wherefore the plaintiff demands judgment of ouster and damages against the two defendants, in addition, or in the alternative plaintiffs demand an injunction restraining the County of Allegheny, from proceeding further against plaintiffs in the Court of Common Plea in regard to the said man and a re-conveyance to the land to which the County had wrongfully acquired title.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.662" offset="550013">In short the bill of complaint asked for a stay of a pending court proceeding in which the parties were then involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.052" offset="587630">The County of Allegheny filed a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.709" offset="602258">The motion was based on the following grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.411" offset="613021">First, at section 2283 of 28 U.S.C. prevented the issuance of an injunction against a pending State Court proceeding and that therefore the District Court had no jurisdiction over the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.277" offset="680521">The second ground given for the motion to dismiss was that this condemnation proceeding in a State Court was an In rem action and that the State Court having acquired jurisdiction over the raise, it had exclusive jurisdiction and that the District Court could not entertain an action which had to concern itself with a title to the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.175" offset="772054">The County, however, went further in its motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.972" offset="787310">It said assuming that the District Court had jurisdiction in view of the fact that there was pending proceeding in a State Court and the parties before the District Court with the same parties before the State Court proceeding and since there was a question that the state law involved that the plaintiffs should have raised that question of the invalidity of the taking first in the State Court proceeding and that therefore the District Court should refrain from exercise its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.899" offset="914996">The motion to dismiss also stated that there was no basis for the cause of action, but that is not relevant to this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.687" offset="950105">Now the facts which brought this case to the District Court are quite simple, because all that we have in here really is aggrieved complaint and a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.171" offset="996080">The Board of County Commissioner of Alleghany County, pursuant to their powers under the Second Class Code, had passed a resolution in June of 1955, condemning various properties for use for the greater Pittsburgh Airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.387" offset="1056893">Included in these properties were 8 acres which were owned by the Mashudas who are the respondents in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.792" offset="1086568">The County then petitioned for a Board of Viewers and in March of 1956 a Board of Viewers came in with an award of approximately $52,000 for the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.119" offset="1143829">The County appealed that award, claiming that the award was excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.715" offset="1162219">The property owners appealed claiming that it was an adequate and the case was then set at issue before the Court of Common Pleas.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.622" offset="1197850">This case was set at issue in the early Court of 1957, which was almost two years after the original resolution and approximately 18 months after the petition for the appointment of viewers.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.706" offset="1258245">Then in May of 1957, the respondents, plaintiffs below, went into the District Court and claimed for the first time that the taking by the county was improper in that we were using it not for a public purpose, not for airport purposes, but for a private purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.165" offset="1340061">I think before going into the argument on the case it might be well to review very briefly the procedure for eminent domain in Pennsylvania some of which was covered in the preceding argument.</text>

            <label>Mr. Philip Baskin</label>
            <text syncTime="332.371" offset="1432848">What happened was that they added as a defendant, in the District Court proceedings, a contractor who the county had issued a contract to for construction of part of the airport paving and the county had also licensed the contractor to use a certain portion of the Mashuda property temporarily for storage purposes for his materials during his construction contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.573" offset="1541622">Now, we have attached that license that the County gave this contractor to our motion to dismiss and it is in the record and that temporary license that was given to him was given to him more than a year after the original taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.648" offset="1605987">However, since the complaint states that it was for a private purpose which we say it on its face is shown not to be and since we moved to dismiss we are proceeding with the case as though there was some grounds for the allegation that there was a taking for a non public purpose.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="396.579" stopTime="408.187">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="396.579" offset="1689684">Was that the only non public purpose that is alleged, just a temporary use of it by the contractor for the construction of the airport?</text>

            <label>Mr. Philip Baskin</label>
            <text syncTime="408.187" offset="1736077">Well, as far as we conceive from the complaint that's all that there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.370" offset="1752900">I think in fairness to plaintiffs they did make an allegation that the county had no plan for using this property other than this plan to temporarily lease it for this contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.079" offset="1811728">That was really the reason why we added to our motion to dismiss the fact that because of that, there was no cause of action in the case, that on its face there was, and there was no basis for action.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.196" offset="1856136">However, that is not before the court and it wasn't before the Court of Appeal below.</text>

            <text syncTime="542.990" offset="2275349">What happens is, once a resolution is passed condemning property there is an appointment of Viewers made by the Court of Common Plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.706" offset="2306173">The Viewers then consider what is taken, what is not been taken and then hands down an award.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.891" offset="2330937">From that award there is an appeal to the Court of Common Pleas which appointed the Board in the first instance and before the Court of Common Pleas you can raise any questions, it's almost a de novo proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.933" offset="2379107">From there you can appeal to the appellate courts of Pennsylvania as in any other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.231" offset="2400319">Now, the peculiar thought about this case that makes its so different from any other case that we can find either in Federal Law or State Law, is that this is the first time that a Federal Court has taken action concerning title to property which is then involved in a condemnation proceeding which has been going in the State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.938" offset="2491120">All the cases that we have been to find which are cited in our brief have held flatly that when the condemnation proceeding is pending in the state court, that the District Court will not interfere with that state proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1315.278" offset="5364485">We are only suggesting that is one of the questions which will be raised subsequently if we permit this District Court proceeding to go on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.093" offset="5403773">Now we say that the lower court had no jurisdiction because of Section 2283 of 28 U.S.C. which states that you cannot enjoin a pending State Court proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.134" offset="5459884">Now the relief that was requested before the District Court asked for that in those very words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.542" offset="5489560">It says wherefore plaintiffs demand judgment of ouster, and in addition or in the alternative an injunction restraining the County of Allegheny from proceeding further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.248" offset="5532400">Now the I think in this very language, the relief places itself within Section 2283, the Circuit Court of Appeals took the position that the plaintiffs were abandoning all thoughts of equitable relief and were asking only for ouster which would be what they consider an action of ejectment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.498" offset="5613380">However, we say that even if we would presuppose that the plaintiffs had abandoned that relief which would not abandon in the District Court that there is no difference between ordering the County of Allegheny to leave the property or ordering them not to take any further steps in connection with that property and the cases are quite clear that if the result of a District Court action has the same result as an injunction against pending State Court proceedings that the Section 2283 comes into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.518" offset="5753396">Now we have cited in our brief many cases in which other circuits have entertained this exact situation that is where condemnation proceedings were pending and a claim was made in the District Court that the taking was invalid because it wasn't for a public purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.634" offset="5821942">And in each one of those cases the Circuit Court has held that Section 2283 prevents the exercise of jurisdiction, but we are prepared to go even further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.564" offset="5865618">We are prepared to say that even if Section 2283 were not here involved and it was just a question of whether the District Court should exercise its jurisdiction or not that there are very cogent reasons why it shouldn't because if the State Court, if the plaintiff is going to the State Court and say here is our question will you handle it and the State Court says yes, we will, there isn't a single federal question that's left open, there is no question of whether Section 2283 applies in this case, there is no question of whether this is an In rem proceeding, in other words all the many questions that have been raised in this proceeding disappear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.537" offset="6033533">But if the District Court says that we will try the case, then all these questions remain and also this question that I presented before of what will happen eventually if the State Court proceeding goes to award of damages and the Federal Court proceeding goes on to a judgment of ouster and you have an award of damages in favor of the plaintiffs in one court and another court those same plaintiff saying that the land was not taken and they are entitled to the land which prevails and which has the effect of res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.360" offset="6180864">Now all we are suggesting in connectin with that is that the purpose of comity principle is to avoid these jurisdictional conflicts between state and Federal Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.570" offset="6229661">Here is an opportunity for the plaintiffs who are already in the pending State Court proceeding to say to the State Court here is our claim and will you pass upon it and if the State Court says yes we will, there is nothing to this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3221.992" offset="12991300">In my research and preparation for this case, I came to the conclusion that in many of the states and particularly those involved in some of the cases cited in the county's brief here, that the reverse is quite true that the -- that the commission in many cases, a railroad commission or something of that kind must in the first instance make a determination even though it is not questioned a determination that taking is for a proper public purpose, not so in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.638" offset="13117942">What the law is in New York I am not qualified to say, because I haven't looked at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.290" offset="13136541">But in this particular case we submit, we submit if Your Honor please that in a suggestion by Mr. Justice Whitaker in the earlier argument that legally speaking this taking which for the purpose of this argument only and not for the purpose of the trail on the merit, on the facts submitted for this argument was as tortuous as if the sheriff had gone out with a gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.867" offset="13230791">And the fact that they've enforced these people off and the fact that they choose to camouflage it as an eminent domain taking, does not vary, the legal result from the standpoint of diversity of citizenship, and the right to proceed in diversity case at law in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.483" offset="13309262">Now there is a practical reason why we want to be in the federal court and I don't think we should overlook it and it doesn't sound very, perhaps very philosophical from those standpoint of jurisprudence, but I think it is exactly the kind of practical consideration that the framers of the Constitution had in mind and that the Congress had in mind in enacting the first diversity of citizenship jurisdiction statutes when they did those things and that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.539" offset="13429530">I think myself that all Judges try to do a good job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.988" offset="13451368">Most Jurors I believe at least think they are trying to do a good job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.368" offset="13468818">It's an issue that's not before us, but we are against the county of Allegheny, we are from Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.532" offset="13501524">We try this case in ejectment of an appeal from the board of view, its going to be before a Jury composed of whom, citizens drawn exclusively from Allegheny county and its going to be tried before a Judge elected by the citizen of Allegheny county.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.532" offset="13569546">Now I think when Alexander Hamilton in the Federalist Papers number 80 said that in a diversity case a person from outside the state has a right to go into a tribunal which does not owe any allegiance to local institutions in order to avoid any possibility of bias.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.899" offset="13634957">I think he was thinking about just the type of a case that we have here and I don't suggest that any common pleas Judge in Allegheny County is going to be biased, but I think we are all sufficiently realistic to know that local people do have let us say perhaps a special sensitivity to local, to local desires and I think that this is a classic case for the exercise of the diversity jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="4365.648" offset="17565968">Well, let me address myself to two different situations which might show the difference in the answers, one is they have alleged here that at the time the county took the property it had no plan for a public purpose, in other words they said at the time of the taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="4383.197" offset="17636185">Now they could have determined at the time of the taking what the purpose is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4388.018" offset="17655411">Now going through an entire condemnation proceeding without objecting to the taking, then getting an award in damages, and then coming back two years later and saying we now believe that at the time of the taking, it was an improper taking, I think they would be foreclosed and the matter would be res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="4406.337" offset="17728763">Now there might be a different situation where if at the time of the taking there was a public purpose, and then perhaps five years later, as is done with private railroad companies, they abandon that public purpose, there is a procedure whereby the original owner maybe able to recover the land, but that's not applicable to a taking for an original public purpose with the municipal government in Pennsylvania, and I say this, that if at the time of the taking there was no question raised about the validity and it goes through a proceeding, that res judicata would apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="4463.505" offset="17957386">In Pennsylvania if the Board of Commissioners say we're taking this for the purpose of adding it to airport purposes, that's a public taking until somebody else shows that it's not for a public purpose.</text>
