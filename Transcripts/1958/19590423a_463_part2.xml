            <text syncTime="10.390" offset="144906">Mr. Chief Justice Warren, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.015" offset="179388">I have sat in this chamber yesterday afternoon and this afternoon during the presentation of the arguments in the Raley, Stern, and Brown cases which our companion cases to the instant case and also to the arguments presented to this Court in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.953" offset="287222">I have listened to the questions propounded of counsel by various members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.881" offset="318882">I feel it is my first duty to the State of Ohio and to this Court to clarify certain issues which in my mind at least certainly need clarification.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.028" offset="375515">Before attempting to do that, I would like to explain to this Court my own relationship to the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.015" offset="411460">The hearing in the instant case was held in Columbus, Ohio in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.211" offset="436224">Columbus is the county seat of Franklin County, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.738" offset="454301">So, that if a contempt occurred, it occurred in Franklin County.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.439" offset="477080">At that time, neither then nor before nor since did I have or have I had any connection with the Ohio Un-American Activities Commission, either as a member or its counsel or any other association.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.271" offset="568508">The record of that hearing was presented to the then prosecuting attorney of Franklin County, and by him to the Franklin County grand jury and an indictment was returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.958" offset="631202">That indictment was for one thing and one thing alone, legislative contempt and let me point out this is a first difference between the instant case and the Raley, Stern, and Brown cases which were under the judicial contempt proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.563" offset="717615">The trial of this case was held by a successor prosecuting attorney to the -- to the prosecuting attorney who had first secured the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.565" offset="765680">By that time, I was an assistant in that office and in fact, prepared the trial brief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.305" offset="792639">The appeals were held under still another prosecuting attorney, now, Congressman Samuel L. Devine from the Twelfth District of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.632" offset="829942">I also handled those appeals before the Ohio Supreme Court on four occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.794" offset="858572">When Congressman Devine left that office, I was appointed by the common pleas court of our county to succeed him.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.257" offset="888351">In other words, I have inherited a case which I have personally handled for five and one-half years.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.702" offset="926177">Standing here representing the State of Ohio, I am not on my own of the responsibility placed on my shoulders in that capacity, but I want to assure this Court in all sincerity that I have lived with this case for five and a half years and I say under the shadow of my own oath, which I took to uphold and defend both the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of Ohio that my arguments represent my own personal deep and abiding convictions or I would not be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.695" offset="1094196">The Morgan case cannot be decided on the facts of any other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.598" offset="1117811">It cannot be decided on the facts of the Raley, Stern, and Brown cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.567" offset="1137664">It cannot be decided on the facts of the Sweezy and Watkins cases or the Bart, Emspak, and Quinn cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.517" offset="1169429">It must be decided on its own facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.276" offset="1184475">So, for a moment, let's place the Morgan case before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.416" offset="1209031">Let's place it here by itself and divest it of some of these other influences, granted that this was the same Commission under which the Raley, Stern, and Brown cases, the preceding case arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.306" offset="1276635">Granted, it is the same Ohio statute which is here under consideration, but it is the conduct of this appellant, Anna Morgan that this Court must pass on in the instant case.</text>

            <text syncTime="330.181" offset="1424071">In my opinion, sir, it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.043" offset="1435564">She was indicted only for a contempt and because of what I am going to point out in the next two or three minutes, I think the Court will see why I at least believe this is a true contempt case.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.742" offset="1490317">Because of certain questions asked yesterday by Mr. Justice Frankfurter, I want to detail a little bit for this Court the conduct of this particular witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.871" offset="1534830">This is not Raley, Brown, and Stern who came in and answered questions and then, when certain types of questions were read, then and there declined to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.415" offset="1584985">This is not the case of Watkins and Sweezy whom Mr. Chief Justice Warren, and the majority of the Court said was not a case of a truculent or contumacious witness who refuses to answer all questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.236" offset="1648306">This is the very case here which the majority in the Watkins and Sweezy cases said that the Watkins and Sweezy cases were not.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.649" offset="1693968">When called before this Commission, this witness in case number 463, Anna Morgan, came armed with a prepared statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.176" offset="1740048">The Commission opened its testimony as far as she was concerned.She was called to the stand and the first thing that was done was she handed them the statement which appears on pages 57 to 59 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.602" offset="1805772">The Supreme Court of Ohio characterized that statement as highly abusive and betrayal, and I would certainly agree with them 100%.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.291" offset="1856554">Anna Morgan did not even wait for a single question to be asked to see what the nature of the questions were going to be, to see whether the questions were pertinent, to see whether the questions would be incriminating.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.677" offset="1918098">She did not wait for the first question to be asked, she presented her prepared statement which said in the last paragraph, they are thereof, “I must remain silent before this Committee.”</text>
            <text syncTime="467.536" offset="1973478">And when -- after stating her name, that's exactly what she did.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.596" offset="1993749">From then on, regardless of what question was asked to her, whether it was a question pertinent or not, I'm not passing on pertinency at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.301" offset="2036590">Pertinent or not, whether or not it was a preliminary question or not, whether or not it was or could have been a self-incriminating question, she refused to answer each and every question of the Commission which was only carrying out the -- the intent which she had already announced she would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.334" offset="2132720">After stating her name, she refused to answer each and every question citing as her reason therefore, the privilege against self-incrimination or the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.572" offset="2197608">A reading of the record in the Morgan case will clearly show that a more contumacious witness can hardly be imagined.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.449" offset="2245151">I agree with Mr. Justice Frankfurter when he said earlier the fact we knew.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.624" offset="2265840">That a witness cannot just pull down the shade and say, “I'm not going to answer any question, whatsoever.”</text>
            <text syncTime="548.511" offset="2297396">Now, that is what she did.</text>

            <text syncTime="616.347" offset="2568756">She came into the hearing when she first arrived there with that statement and I think that she had already made up her mind and I'm going to come back to that point in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.867" offset="2606791">She had already made up her mind that she was going to refuse each, every, any, and all questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.570" offset="2637615">She had charted her own course of conduct before she ever came into that Committee room and I don't think that anything she heard there or anything that was said to her by the Commission or the Chairman or anyone else had the slightest effect on the course of conduct which she had already charted and began to carry out.</text>

            <text syncTime="953.651" offset="3917928">I did not cite this case to the Court because it is an expression of the opinion of this Court, although this Court, the Supreme Court did deny certiorari in this case at 333 U.S. 838 I believe is the page citation.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.062" offset="3979577">But I -- I use this because to my way of thinking, this is the most logical explanation of our own situation in the Morgan case which I have come across.</text>

            <text syncTime="1010.760" offset="4146448">After what had transpired as shown above, the propounding of one or more specific questions would have been both futile and time wasting and appellants renewed or repute -- repeated refusal to answer them would have added nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.930" offset="4203081">He had made it crystal clear that he was determined not to answer any question concerning the subject matter under investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.647" offset="4241951">Any argument to the effect that it was not shown that he refused to reply to any such questions can only be regarded therefore as wholly specious.</text>

            <text syncTime="1072.907" offset="4395029">I think that that passage of the Court of Appeals follows very much in line with the argument of the Supreme Court of Ohio in the majority opinion in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.943" offset="4443094">That pertinency here is really not an issue because she was going to refuse to answer any questions whatsoever, whether or not pertinency is shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.649" offset="4493981">That direction to answer would have been futile because a direction to answer would have only brought forth the exact same reply that she gave time after time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.671" offset="4542046">It is on that position that the Supreme Court of Ohio has hinged its opinion after a consideration of this case on four separate occasions, and I think to my way of thinking at least, I think a reading of this record will clearly show that that is exactly what this witness, this appellant was going to do, announced she was going to do and in fact, did do.</text>

            <text syncTime="1600.163" offset="6504051">I'm not going into the applicability of the Fifth Amendment because the Supreme Court of Ohio has said that whatever privilege she had, be it Fifth Amendment or Article 1 Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution, she claimed it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1730.274" offset="7024515">Now, there is something which I feel and I feel very definite must be said in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.356" offset="7080835">I make no claim to being a learner than scholarly constitutional lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.023" offset="7111450">There are attorneys who devote a lifetime to studying constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.973" offset="7139244">I do not have the time to devote to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.327" offset="7160665">But with the legal training and experience which I have, coupled with what I hope at least is a normal amount of common sense and logic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.704" offset="7210193">I think this case presents four constitutional questions, either -- or four constitutional amendments to be considered, either directly or collaterally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.592" offset="7277693">The first is the Fifth Amendment which we have just been discussing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.325" offset="7296711">I'm not going to cite the cases with which the Court is far more familiar than I am.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.446" offset="7321161">The -- the series of cases which have laid down the principle that the Fifth Amendment is not available in a state proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.954" offset="7359195">As I have said, the Ohio Supreme Court is disposed of that question, as held that the privilege was invoked if any privilege in fact existent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.862" offset="7398797">Appellant has again here raised the double sovereignty question, and I'm not going to argue that question because this Court again is far more familiar with the arguments in the cases on that subject that I am.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.460" offset="7457207">I am merely going to say that in as much as under the Ohio Statute, the -- the immunity statute, this appellant was far more protected than she would have been by the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.423" offset="7545083">I think we no longer have the question of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.746" offset="7582386">The Fifth Amendment does not apply under the long line of decisions of this Court, and the Ohio constitutional provision does apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.203" offset="7632227">And as decided by the Ohio Court, this witness had a greater immunity than the privilege against self-incrimination which the Ohio constitution would have given her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.903" offset="7686980">I just don't think we any longer have a Fifth Amendment question for this Court to determine.Now, the next amendment which has been raised in this case is the First Amendment for the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.417" offset="7765034">Again, there is a long line of cases which hold that the Fourteenth Amendment is not shorthand for the first date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.271" offset="7796485">I grant there are cases, some of them recently decided, I am fully aware of those which hold that even though the Fourteenth is not shorthand for the first date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.834" offset="7850715">There are certain inherent First Amendment rights incorporated within our concept with due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.673" offset="7882062">And with that holding I would not quarrel, but I say this, “In the very conduct of human affairs, I don't care where it is, when it is, or what it's about.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.892" offset="7942980">Everything that we do everyday of our life in someway touches of what our First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.283" offset="7980492">And I say that if the First Amendment of the United States Constitution is to be interpreted to preclude any punishment or anything which in any way touches upon those First Amendment rights, then I am afraid that we had to better take another look at all of our penal laws, all of our criminal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.739" offset="8082369">The very law of assault in Ohio at least, there can be assault by virtue of words, a mere threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.055" offset="8119568">If we are to say, “You cannot convict me of assault because I have freedom of speech to say I am going to kill you,” then I think we have gone too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.894" offset="8158960">And in this case, certainly, these questions in the very conduct or the very nature of the course of human affairs touched upon First Amendment rights, freedom of speech, freedom of press, freedom of assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.094" offset="8215698">But I say that there is a point, there must be a point at which these things can no longer transcend the rights of some governmental control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.574" offset="8261674">Now, it is my understanding that -- and this is -- as I pointed out in my brief at page 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.108" offset="8303783">This was pointed out by Mr. Justice Frankfurter in the Schweitzer case, in the Sweezy case, that this Court's review is limited, to a review under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.833" offset="8374732">At least, that as I say, is my understanding of the law before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.844" offset="8410781">Now, it is the conduct that the hearing of this witness, it is the commission of the crime which he actually committed, a misdemeanor, certainly a contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.889" offset="8470967">As the only thing she is indicted for is a contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.174" offset="8488103">But what she is indicted for occurred at the hearing, and I think we here become confronted with a serious question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.068" offset="8543692">I ask this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.548" offset="8557589">As the Fourteenth Amendment concept of due process of law apply to the commission of a crime itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.472" offset="8601266">Clearly, in the case of any crime, it applies starting with perhaps the arrest, the indictment through the trial and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.385" offset="8632926">A person is guaranteed due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.109" offset="8651839">But here, the appellant is attempting to apply their concept of due process of law to her own commission of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.928" offset="8687052">The crime occurred at the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.402" offset="8693008">That's where the crime occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.495" offset="8705337">In no other case which I can conceivably think of is the perpetrator of a crime guaranteed due process of law during the perpetration of his crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.877" offset="8766882">I think there -- there has been no claim of denial in this case of due process, at any step subsequent to the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.764" offset="8806379">It was her conduct at the hearing for which she was indicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.018" offset="8823411">It was therefore her conduct that the hearing which was the crime which was committed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3284.537" offset="13241553">And then, the Ohio Supreme Court concluded as I have argued here that that did not mislead her in anyway that it did not influence her in anyway in her course of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.502" offset="13289409">She had already charted that course of conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="3334.381" offset="13440920">Other cases which have been decided, the majority opinions have said they were not the contumacious type of witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.490" offset="13473311">I submit in the instant case, this was a contumacious witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.394" offset="13492955">I submit that Ohio had power to punish that contempt if it occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.727" offset="13522317">I submit the contempt did occur, and I submit that the punishment which amounted here to a fine of $500 was fully proper and that the decision of the Ohio Supreme Court which has been made under its interpretation of Ohio's Constitution and statutes should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3384.859" offset="13642794">Very -- I think it may help even at this late date to go back over the fact in this case because I don't think they've been presented in chronological order in such a way as to be absolutely clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.029" offset="13687515">First, I would like to say though as a sort of a joke that if it is true that nothing was further from the mind of the witness during her testimony, then the problem of pertinency, I would say that there was nothing further from the mind of the Chairman and the other members of the Commission than the existence of an Ohio Immunity Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.557" offset="13777586">The last day of March 1952, hearings were held in Columbus by the Ohio Un-American Activities Commission and one John DeLong testified at length concerning one Anna Morgan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.444" offset="13821158">And he discussed where she lived, what her position in the Communist Party was and the kind of work she had done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.793" offset="13846549">The following day was April 1st, 1952 and on that day, four witnesses where called before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.750" offset="13874343">The first one was Mr. Terrell (ph), the second one was Mrs. Morgan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.403" offset="13888972">In other words, on March 31st in Columbus, John DeLong was question that was a friendly witness and discussed at length appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.080" offset="13923662">The following day, she was the second witness to appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.542" offset="13937560">First -- first witness, Mr. Terrell (ph), my also representative at that time, not in the hearing but in the trial, it was a companion case with this at one time, was asked a number of questions, all of which she declined to answer on the basis of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.055" offset="13991581">Whether he was asked, whether he knew Anna Morgan, I don't recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.585" offset="14005687">In any event, during his testimony as we've discussed several times now, he was told that he had a right to refuse to answer any question, the answer to -- which might incriminate you, otherwise you are required to answer at page 11 or page 62 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.836" offset="14074755">Mrs. Morgan was or was not present during the testimony of John DeLong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.552" offset="14093563">The record doesn't indicate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.455" offset="14101191">Certainly, that was an open hearing and it was reported in the present, she was well aware of it when she came into the hearing, the following day with a prepared statement and she definitely was in the hearing room at the time that Mr. Terrell (ph) was questioned and then she heard Chairman Renner make the statement to Mr. Terrell (ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.572" offset="14173706">Therefore, while it is true that she came in with a prepared statement, it is also true that she knew that her name had come up in the hearing the previous day and she had heard the prior witness given a certain advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.917" offset="14223026">I do not see how anyone can know what she would have done if Mr. Terrell (ph) had been given a different kind of advise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.731" offset="14250297">She might or might not have put her statement into the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.663" offset="14262000">That's I think impossible to say.</text>

            <text syncTime="3587.794" offset="14454575">This Court couldn't go into that, but I think this Court reading the fact, can conclude that under the Fourteenth Amendment, it is a denial of due process to find someone guilty of contempt for a willful refusal which is the wording of the indictment, a willful refusal to answer the questions in the face of these facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3614.110" offset="14559796">Now, her statement says two things which I think are of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.422" offset="14573066">One is that, as I mentioned earlier in my argument before, that in all these months, the Commission has failed to state what it considers Un-American or subversive.</text>

            <text syncTime="3639.740" offset="14662301">She also said in her statement that the -- because this Committee conducts its hearings like an inquisition with no rules of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.236" offset="14696364">It -- its victims are denied the rights which they would have in a duly constituted Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.337" offset="14716740">Therefore, I must claim the protection of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and remain silent before this Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.984" offset="14743280">I think this is a fairly clear statement which if she had -- had a lawyer, she might have made during the course of the hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="4206.940" offset="16931088">The fact that the matter is that this was a woman who could -- who was aware of the possibility of denaturalization action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4216.418" offset="16969017">If you wish to call this a prosecution or not, I don't know if that's important.</text>

            <text syncTime="4226.135" offset="17007888">It's not in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4227.147" offset="17011963">She was native born.</text>
            <text syncTime="4228.032" offset="17015515">She had married during the period when you lose your citizenship and she had later become a citizen over again through naturalization and she was aware of these facts when she testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="4237.970" offset="17055222">Nothing of this is in the record however, but she was asked, “Do you -- would the answer to incriminate you?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4243.286" offset="17076537">And she answered, “Yes, it would.</text>
            <text syncTime="4244.715" offset="17082284">Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4247.082" offset="17091688">Then, she was asked what the Fifth Amendment was and she just kept saying, “Fifth Amendment, Fifth Amendment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4252.289" offset="17112482">Now, it maybe that the State of Ohio Supreme Court, reading this record, thinks this was a very strange witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4258.821" offset="17138604">They asked her, “What is the Fifth Amendment?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4260.183" offset="17144142">And she merely says, “I am appealing under the Fifth Amendment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4262.737" offset="17154278">I do not think it is strange for -- for a client without counsel to be fairly careful of her answers in this kind of a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4270.397" offset="17184998">It maybe she was intelligent enough to write a statement in a quieter room.</text>
            <text syncTime="4274.214" offset="17200253">But to think on her feet and give an accurate answer, a careful answer which wouldn't waive any right, I think at that stage of the law, 1952, what a person would know from newspapers, I think it is fairly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="4286.818" offset="17250617">This wasn't a rigid person who was denying the possibility of a discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4290.892" offset="17266918">She was merely afraid to get away from a formula which she thought was safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="4295.642" offset="17285935">The next count in indictment, the question was, “How long have you been a resident of Franklin County, Mrs. Morgan?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4301.413" offset="17309027">And she said -- she continued to appeal -- appeal under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4304.065" offset="17319581">For this, she was fined.</text>
            <text syncTime="4306.116" offset="17327835">And it seems clear to me that this is purely a preliminary question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4310.351" offset="17344763">It could have had no significance, unless it is somehow connected with the last count in the indictment which I will read when I come to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4318.824" offset="17378617">Then, she was asked, “Where are you employed as count five?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4321.828" offset="17390634">On that count, she was fined.</text>
            <text syncTime="4324.296" offset="17400560">And you will find throughout the questioning a number of questions later on indicating that she had been a paid Communist Party organizer, count 12, count 14, both indicate these.</text>
            <text syncTime="4338.253" offset="17456358">So that, her concern over answering, "Where are you employed and her refusal to answer under the privilege makes sense when you read the later questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4346.893" offset="17490944">The next count on which she was fined was, “Mrs. Morgan, are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4352.200" offset="17512155">And the continuing count thereafter all relate to the Communist Party until you get into count 28, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="4360.147" offset="17543920">Now, count seven was -- on count seven, she was acquitted in the common pleas court after trial, as its being identical with count six and 36.</text>
            <text syncTime="4370.810" offset="17586657">In other words, we argued at the trial court that these questions were repetitious and that they were not pertinent, and two of the questions were thrown out on the ground of no pertinency.</text>
            <text syncTime="4380.270" offset="17624482">That is the question at the top of page 50 and the question at the bottom of page 55 concerning the Civil Rights Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4387.938" offset="17655097">Both of those counts were thrown out on the ground of no pertinency.</text>
            <text syncTime="4390.904" offset="17667009">And counts six and 30 -- count seven and 36 were thrown out on the ground of their being repetitious.</text>
            <text syncTime="4397.476" offset="17693236">Our argument -- our only argument with the trial court was that they should have thrown out all of the counts from seven on, on the ground that they were identical with seven, before that sole reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="4409.697" offset="17742137">In terms of the answer as to her home, in addition to the problem which I mentioned before about DeLong having testified concerning meetings having been held at her home, the counts in 11 -- 17 and 18, and 19, and 20, and 21, and 24, and 25, and 26, all asked questions connecting her home with Communist Party headquarters or Communist Party meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4436.475" offset="17849240">So, there can be no doubt that there was an honest claim of the privilege in connection with her testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="4445.434" offset="17885080">I would like to say in conclusion that while it would be possible for this Court to decide this case and to reverse the conviction of this appellant solely on the ground that the failure to direct to answer and the failure to show a willful refusal to answer in the face of the statement by the Chairman that she need not answer, there are pending now in Ohio 20 similar cases before this same Commission which is now the debunked and it would be of considerable value if this Court, considering this case on -- for the second time on -- acted a remand under Watkins and Sweezy if the Court covered issues beyond the direction to answer and the failure to show a willful refusal to answer.</text>
