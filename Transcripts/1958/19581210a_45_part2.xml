            <text syncTime="37.424" offset="253053">And if the Court will bear with me, I'll resume reading at the first of the sentence, I have started thusly.</text>

            <text syncTime="49.092" offset="299760">“That said threats and the duress in coercion upon the distributors arising out of and resulting from said threats of litigation, threaten to and have, in fact, deprived plaintiff and its said California Theatre of the right to negotiate for motion pictures upon their first-run in the San Bernardino area, and to negotiate for clearance over theatres in competition with plaintiff's said theatre upon said first-run, including defendant's Bel-Air Drive-In Theatre.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.476" offset="413236">That plaintiff is without any speedy or adequate remedy at law and will be irreparably harmed unless defendant and its officers, agents, and employees are restrained and enjoined from instituting any action under the antitrust laws against plaintiff and said distributors, or any of them, based upon the facts hereinabove alleged during the pendency of this action.</text>

            <text syncTime="197.452" offset="893158">For the reason that the gravamen of the complaint constitutes or is constituted by the threats of duress, which we say were unlawfully exercised or wrongfully exercised.</text>

            <text syncTime="216.256" offset="968391">Now, there is a collateral aspect to that, too, to answer your question fully, Mr. Justice Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.691" offset="994095">I can conceive of the situation in which a party has the right to negotiate for a prior run without clearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.173" offset="1040071">That is, I can see that a supplier of motion pictures has, absent a conspiracy, the right to pick his costumers as he sees fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.670" offset="1082075">And that, I think also could be the subject of adjudication under this complaint heard as an equity action.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.329" offset="1128678">Now, as I say, the gravamen of this action is the allegation of threats and the effect those threats have had.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.189" offset="1196178">That is a fact to be determined by the Court sitting in equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.930" offset="1215091">As is the question of competition may very well be a fact to be determined by the Court sitting in equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.500" offset="1245393">Now, I must pause there and say that if an equity action is properly alleged, it's of course within the power of the Chancellor to decide questions of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.035" offset="1299519">We can only turn to the -- or need only turn to the familiar examples of a specific damage or a specific performance, action based of the -- an action for damages on contract or an action to quiet title versus an action in ejectment.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.663" offset="1370049">Those two sets of examples present, and I could modify them, present situations in which the Chancellor and the Court or the law side of the Court have equivalent duties and equivalent powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.238" offset="1452283">So, I say here, simply because there are factual issues for the resolution of the judge sitting as an equity judge does not ipso facto deprive him of equity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.997" offset="1511320">I'm of course stating obvious law but you cannot dismiss this complaint or characterize it as an action of law simply by saying there are various factual issues which under other circumstances might well be tried by a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.836" offset="1582686">We've asked for a very narrow relief here.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.825" offset="1594702">This is not a substitute for an antitrust action in the traditional sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.987" offset="1615287">We've asked for only one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.072" offset="1627617">That we be allowed to negotiate equally with the other party, with the defendant for a first-run with clearance.</text>

            <text syncTime="490.814" offset="2066578">The Court had set our case down for trial after these motions and so forth, as I recall it in July of 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.594" offset="2105762">So that -- and we had constantly urged upon the Court, and this does appear in the record, that it set our case down for an early trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.506" offset="2161351">We -- we followed all the provisions of the rules, so far as I am aware of them, with respect to our getting an injunction on a full hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.753" offset="2206386">We would have had to do additional things to secure a preliminary injunction or restraining order, I conceive that.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.095" offset="2243793">Now, going back to the matter, of whether or not this is in fact a substitute for the provisional treble damage action, I would say that the proof that it is not is found in the type of action that ultimately, the defendant filed by way of counterclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.918" offset="2355075">In that, and the specifications of conspiracy that are there alleged are found starting at page 39 of the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="586.889" offset="2450892">This is in the counterclaim, to make it intelligible, of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.360" offset="2472835">Preliminarily, I should like to mention that on page 39, in paragraph (e), it is alleged that for the purpose of establishing and maintaining a monopoly of exclusive, and I emphasize the word “exclusive”, first-run exhibition, and for the purpose of establishing and maintaining a monopoly of first-run patronage, three exhibitors entered into a combination conspiracy attempt to monopolize and so forth, as herein after alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.086" offset="2599685">Now, that is much broader than the narrow thing we seek in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.764" offset="2646392">We acknowledge that the defendant here has an equivalent right with us to first-run.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.795" offset="2674604">So, the adjudication of the issue put or posed in our complaint would be neither the defense to the charge that is made here in (e), or would it be necessarily adjudicated by a jury finding on (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="660.804" offset="2746598">We certainly, according to our complaint, have not sought and do not seek an exclusive first-run.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.223" offset="2784214">We simply seek, as I have repeated, perhaps ad nauseam, the right to negotiate equally with the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.559" offset="2821622">Now, following along with the various specifications, I shall try to paraphrase them and they're found at pages 39, 40, and 41 of the record, that the specifications are seven in number.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.017" offset="2899466">One, six, and seven charge a conspiracy among the three exhibitors there mentioned, to arrogate to themselves a monopoly of first-run exhibition in San Bernardino.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.994" offset="2971355">And in one of those specifications, there is broader language that says in other areas, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.027" offset="3003434">Specifications 2 and 3 deal with an allocation of product among the three exhibitors, sometimes called in the parlance of the industry as split of product.</text>

            <text syncTime="3474.232" offset="14000253">Your Honors, just briefly, I want to address myself to two questions, briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.233" offset="14024286">First, I think on the question of our right to jury trial on the complaint standing alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.975" offset="14043303">It's clear that the counsel stands on the right in a court trial of all of the issues upon only upon the grounds that they pray for a injunction pendente lite against the filing of antitrust case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.857" offset="14102758">And I submit that the tail cannot wag the dog in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.057" offset="14115610">You cannot characterize a -- a complaint entirely as an equitable manner by an allegation of pendente lite relief or pendente lite relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.839" offset="14162735">Secondly, on the question of the relationship of the allegations of the complaint to the counterclaim, we allege that there was a -- one of the elements of the conspiracy was a conspiracy to grant clearance between these theatres.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.407" offset="14212995">If there were no substantial competition between those two theatres, that would be an unreasonable restraint of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.944" offset="14243192">And on that fact, a prior decision by the Court will be res judicata on the counterclaim and will be vital to the allegation and the proof of the counterclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.372" offset="14288854">It is not the only issue and we can see it, it isn't the only issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.518" offset="14301393">There are other grounds for relief or the basis of this -- and other acts in furtherance of the conspiracy which were alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.395" offset="14332949">But it is an important one and an essential one with respect to the proof in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.349" offset="14360743">And finally, with -- with respect to the question raised about, as to mandamus, I agree with Mr. Justice Harlan so that this matter can only considered by you in a mandamus question with respect to the matter of power.</text>
