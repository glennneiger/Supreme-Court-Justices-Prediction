            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">-- understanding of Mr. Wines' position in part of the oral argument -- I think Mr. Wines' position on the part of the State was that the statute here burdened interstate commerce but he did not concede, as I understand it that it was an undue burden on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.780" offset="191488">I apologize.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.559" offset="194623">I perhaps misunderstood him.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.962" offset="200265">And part of my argument wasn't predicated on that proposition but I do want to set the record the straight.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.840" offset="223775">Yesterday, the question was asked as to whether or not the Interstate Commerce Commission had promulgated certain safety rules and regulations with respect to the kind of equipment that should be upon motor vehicles operating in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.450" offset="282185">And I'd like to direct your attention, if I may please, to the parts and accessories provision of the safety rules and regulations of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.189" offset="321160">And the specific question was the extent or the type of equipment which was regulated pursuant to these safety rules and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.505" offset="358463">The safety rules and regulations of the Interstate Commerce Commission which governed the movement of motor vehicles in interstate commerce cover generally the category of lighting devices, reflectors and electrical equipment and there follow a detailed explanation of the kind of electrical equipment and lighting devices which are required.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.637" offset="446966">There also follows a description of brakes with respect to their adequacy and detailed description with respect to that kind of regulation is also set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.379" offset="489911">There follows also a discussion and a requirement concerning the windows, the glazing and the window construction of the vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.398" offset="521989">There follows a requirement with respect to the kind of fuel systems which are necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.366" offset="541842">There follows a requirement with respect to coupling devices and towing methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.647" offset="558979">And then there is a subdivision which concerned itself with miscellaneous parts and accessories.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.400" offset="581966">And among them are these, tires, heaters, windshield wiper, defrosting device, mirrors, horns, speedometer, exhaust system, protection against shifting cargo, flags and so forth.</text>
