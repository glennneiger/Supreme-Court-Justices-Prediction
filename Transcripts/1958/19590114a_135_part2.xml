            <text syncTime="46.154" offset="287953">In other words, a violation of 2313, and it comes down to the question of whether the transporter is covered by the word "whoever" in 2313.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.525" offset="345422">And on that, we think the answer must be yes in a proper case where acts of concealment are proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.617" offset="385860">He can, the transporter can properly be found guilty of a violation of 2313 because 2313 punishes not only receives, conceals and stores but sells and disposes of an automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.139" offset="463914">And on its face and in the legislative history, it seems evident that whoever sells an automobile may very well be the transporter.</text>
