            <text syncTime="25.175" offset="204048">This is a certiorari which this Court has granted to review the action of the Supreme Court of the State of North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.864" offset="238843">In that action, the Court dismissed a libel suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.579" offset="257651">The action was a defendant on the ground that there was no liability on the part of the station, the television station, WDAY.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.474" offset="297253">Of course, under the provisions of Section 315 of the Communications Act, there was immunity granted by implication to the station.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.127" offset="343855">This is the Section 315, which grants equal opportunity to an opposing candidate in campaigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.699" offset="390144">The Section 315 as in so construed by the lower court so as to deprive plaintiffs including as I did in this case, the petitioner who as its name implies, the Farmers Educational Union, is of course not a candidate for public office.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.881" offset="470915">Therefore, we haven't checked this under 315, the issue as to whether (a) Immunity is granted, and (b), if it's granted as against the plaintiffs who are non-candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.594" offset="521697">Very briefly, the facts in this case were there, it involved the 1956 Senatorial campaigns in the State of North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.829" offset="566732">The candidates were Senator Young who is the incumbent, and Mr. Burdick, who is his opponent.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.968" offset="599228">Both of these gentlemen had time granted to them by this station, WDAY, in Fargo, South Dakota.</text>

            <text syncTime="150.845" offset="706748">Under that law, all that is required is 300 votes to qualify a person as a candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.355" offset="736841">There's no doubt and we do not dispute that Townley was a qualified candidate, entitled to the provisions of equal opportunity under Section 315.</text>

            <text syncTime="314.986" offset="1363362">The statement that appeared then was transferred into an act arising out of these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.570" offset="1393664">But first, the station admitted when the script was given to it that it didn't like the script.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.614" offset="1425847">It -- I can't say rejected it, but it told the candidate that it was objectionable because it's libelous.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.470" offset="1457298">It would be found that in the record, the Court of Appeals of the State found at the top of page 32 of the record that -- 36 of the record, it is conceded by the defendant, WDAY, that the language in the Townley speech complained of by the plaintiff is libelous per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.366" offset="1568789">The defendant pleaded not only in this statute but the statute of the State of South -- of North Dakota that gave us immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.737" offset="1602330">That was demurred to, and the demurrer in that case was sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.080" offset="1619675">It was not appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.814" offset="1626676">The second ground of demurrer was on the ground of Section 315, which is the provision that brings this action before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.263" offset="1660426">It was alleged that under the rules of the Federal Communications committee, this station would be up for a relicense every three years and under the rule to that Commission, at the end of three years, the Court would look into the fact just to determine whether or not the station had operated satisfactorily during the three-year period and by decision, it was rendered by that court -- case of the court (Inaudible) it was held that a station under the provisions of 315 was not entitled to examine or to -- libelous materials and that the station was exempt, immune from liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.897" offset="1842970">It is our contention at Section 315 admittedly, providing no such immunity, explicitly, that does not provide immunity by implication and next, if it does, in no event that any such immunity applied to the petitioner or any other third person who is not a candidate for public office, and my third point is that if it does held in such a way, then in that event it is our contention that the statute I so construed is unconstitutional as against this petitioner.</text>
