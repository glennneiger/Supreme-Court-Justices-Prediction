            <text syncTime="27.078" offset="211675">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.791" offset="222542">We are here on appeal from an order of the New York State Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.017" offset="247411">The order sustained a ban of a moving picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.372" offset="272906">The name of the picture is Lady Chatterley's Lover based on a novel by D.H.Lawrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.519" offset="309478">Under the laws of the State of New York, a film may not be shown in a public theater until it has first been shown to a Board of Censors known as the Motion Picture Division, and it is approved and licensed by that division.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.068" offset="415640">The Motion Picture Division is an agency of the Department of Education which is governed by the Board of Regents and, hence, the appellees in this case are the Regents of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.497" offset="485334">Originally, when the film was submitted to the Motion Picture Division, the division indicated that it would not license the film unless three short sequences, taking about two minutes in all, were deleted.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.329" offset="572688">The appellant, the distributor of the film who owns the exhibition rights, refused to make any deletion and appealed, as he was required to do, to the Regents.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.224" offset="636217">The Regents decided that not only were the three short sequences immoral, but that the whole picture was immoral.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.587" offset="689716">An appeal was taken from a -- from the determination of the Regents to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, and the Appellate Division held the statute, under which, the film was banned to be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.641" offset="761919">The regents then appealed to the New York State Court of Appeals, and that court reversed the decision of the Appellate Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.993" offset="811342">Now, there is no majority opinion in the Court of Appeals of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.920" offset="835062">Three of the judges ruled that the statutes in question were constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.852" offset="862751">Three voted for -- to affirm the lower court which held the statute unconstitutional and one judge who cast the deciding vote stated that he wasn't sure whether the statute was constitutional or not and that this Court ought to decide the question, and it is now here before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.447" offset="961181">Now, we are seeking various kinds of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.123" offset="987826">We first seek a declaration from this Court, as we did below, by the way, that the entire film licensing system be declared unconstitutional as a prohibited form of prior restraint of communication.</text>

            <text syncTime="435.664" offset="1846000">The first, that the term “immoral” as defined by the legislature is so vague as to permit the suppression of speech which is protected by the constitution and, for that reason, it offends against the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.662" offset="1922069">And, the second prong for that point or argument is that the statute, as interpreted, permits the suppression of ideas, the suppression of advocacy and it is, for that reason, a violation of the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.040" offset="2003571">Now, if that relief is also denied, we seek an order reversing the ban of this particular film on the ground that it is not of a type of film that may be suppressed, that it has social values and social importance that the constitution protects, and that far-outweighs any possible legal objection to the film.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.675" offset="2146095">Now, with respect to the first point, that the entire licensing law is invalid.</text>

            <text syncTime="615.274" offset="2564472">The question was deliberately left open in the case of Burstyn against Wilson.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.892" offset="2598954">In that case, the Court characterized the very law that's under consideration here as unbridled censorship, as a form of prior restraint to be especially condemned, and stated that the State of New York is under a heavy burden to demonstrate the necessity for allowing any such censorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.592" offset="2753703">The Regents have interpreted that decision to mean that this Court has countenanced and sustained the validity of prior censorship laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.658" offset="2834056">The opinion of Judge Conway in the court below seems to have read that the -- I mean, in the opinion, Judge Conway seems to have read the Court's opinion in the Burstyn case in precisely the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.152" offset="2899989">I submit, Your Honor, that there is no language in the opinion that would justify that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.857" offset="2926843">And, in fact, every case involving moving -- moving picture licensing laws that has come before the Court since that time, and there have been five, in every case, the Court has reversed the determination suppressing the particular film.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.145" offset="3043976">The reason that we find the law -- the licensing law particularly offensive is it one must, in order to exercise his right of communication, and this Court has recognized the right to show a film or has recognized films as a mean of communication, is that one must come hand in hand in order to secure permission to exercise his right of expression and the public may not be allowed to see a picture or to receive a communication until it has been -- it has been certified as fit for approval by this censorship body.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.751" offset="3234356">Under the law of New York, as it is -- now exists, there is very little right of review of a decision of the Administrative Board in the respect that its determination of the facts cannot be reversed unless its determination is clearly unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.337" offset="3364760">The burden is placed on whoever owns the rights to the picture to show that this determination of the -- of the Regents or the Administrative Board was unreasonable, and it's an impossible burden to sustain.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.857" offset="3446784">And, I believe, in the history of the State of New York, it has been sustained only once and the question of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.529" offset="3473533">This law has been, in effect, I believe, since about 1911 in various forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.639" offset="3489938">I may not be sure that -- I may not be correct about the date, but it has been in effect for a very long time and only once was there a reversal on the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.500" offset="3525360">There had been several reversals based on the finding that the law was, in part, unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.688" offset="3558170">But, now, with respect to this burden that is placed on the one who would show his picture, I think it's best illustrated by this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.244" offset="3604355">We have here a finding that the film is immoral and, according to the Court, the determination of whether or not it's immoral must be made in accordance with the mores and standards of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.902" offset="3687006">The distributor of the picture must, to convince the Court that the determination of the Regents of the Censorship Board was improper and unreasonable, show that the community standings are different that the -- that the picture is not really immoral in accordance with the community standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.869" offset="3798810">In short, he must prove the community standards or reaction to a picture which he cannot show to the public or to the community.</text>

            <text syncTime="1037.198" offset="4252191">In 1954, this Court had before it the picture -- the -- the case of Commercial Pictures Cooperation against the Regents in which the New York statute was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.444" offset="4297122">The statute, as it then read in 1954 and as it's germane to this case, provided that a license would be -- would be issued if -- unless a picture was found immoral, and just the word “immoral” was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.081" offset="4367653">The New York Court of Appeals, in passing on the statute and on the -- in that particular case, ruled that the term “immoral,” as used in the statute, was limited to sexual immorality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.859" offset="4430764">This Court, of course, was bound by the interpretation or construction of the law that was placed on it by the highest Court of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.169" offset="4460022">As a matter of fact, counsel for the Regents, who also appear in this case, argued to this Court that it was bound by the determination of the Court of Appeals and that the word “immoral,” as used in Section 122 of the law, meant sexually immoral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.925" offset="4539120">Within four months after the decision or the opinion of this Court was handed down, the New York State legislature enacted Section 122-a, purportedly, to cure that vagueness, to make the statute definite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.370" offset="4600874">And, now, may I read it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.444" offset="4609128">It defines the term “immoral,” as used in Section 122, to mean “of such a character.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.786" offset="4650506">I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.712" offset="4654268">It says that the term “immoral” shall denote a motion picture, film, or a part thereof, the dominant purpose or effect of which is erotic or pornographic or which portrays acts of sexual immorality, perversion, or lewdness, or which expressly or impliedly presents such acts of desirable, acceptable, or proper patterns of behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.726" offset="4766281">Now, counsel for the Regents in the Court below conceded that the words “erotic” or “pornographic” didn't really lend much to the meaning or to the precision of the word that it didn't give it much clarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.860" offset="4846843">But, counsel argued that we need not concern ourselves with these words which are just as vague as the word “immoral,” but we are to limit ourselves to the consideration of the following language “or which portrays acts of sexual immorality,” etcetera, “as desirable, acceptable, or proper.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.529" offset="4941511">It is using the term “sexual immorality.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.751" offset="4954363">It says all we have to do now is find -- is to -- is to show that a particular picture portrays an act of sexual immorality as a proper pattern of behavior, and that is very, very precise and clear and definite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.332" offset="5024684">In fact, counsel says that the statute couldn't possibly be made more definite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.647" offset="5049971">Now, how are you going to put -- how are you going to determine whether or not a picture portrays an act of sexual immorality in a favorable light if you don't know what sexual immorality means?</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.748" offset="5110366">And, this Court had, in effect, held that the term “sexual immorality” was unconstitutionally vague.</text>

            <text syncTime="1778.234" offset="7216358">I think that, in an issue relating to the First Amendment, the Court may, of course, consider the question on the broadest grounds.</text>

            <text syncTime="2005.777" offset="8126464">That, in 1927, there were a great many commissions and bureaus all over the State of New York and the people thought that that was not the way to operate in that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.885" offset="8178918">So, they passed a constitutional amendment which said that there could be only 18 state departments and that every bureau, commission's bureau, and everything else had to be assigned to one of those departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.664" offset="8233984">The Motion Picture Commission, as originally had been set up, was a separate organization and, after this constitutional amendment, it became essential to determine where that Commission should be assigned and there was a great deal of discussion in its assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.226" offset="8304306">The legislature finally assigned to the Education Department, and I think one of the difficulties, perhaps in my earlier arguments here and in the discussion of this case as we've had it heretofore, has been that I don't think any of us are recognizing the fact that when they put this thing in the Education Department of the State of New York, they were treating this matter as an educational matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.520" offset="8405452">That when they said, “you license motion pictures,” they were the -- saying the same thing to the Board of Regents as when they said to the Board of Regents “you license a trade school or you license a doctor or you license a -- some procedure in the field of education irrespective of the area, whether it's a nursery school or whether it's hotel education.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2557.006" offset="10331408">So that, our -- our position, I think, is very clarifying is as I can answer that the legislature recognizing everything that this Court has said in the past that the need of a clear standard to guide the Board of Regents, and -- and I -- I think I should say, parenthetically, that this act of the Regent -- of the legislature was not the recommendation primarily of the Board of Regents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.688" offset="10446137">This statute was drawn by the counsel for the Governor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.702" offset="10458154">It was backed by the parties -- both parties in the legislature and passed unanimously.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.756" offset="10486366">And, while of course the regents endorsed it, as did every other educational group of the State, the school boards, the parent-teachers, and that's one reason why I think we're dealing with an educational problem because the people that are concerned with education came in and said, “we want this statute,” and the legislature passed it unanimously, trying to rectify and to set up a standard which they hope this Court would think met the minimum requirements for standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.458" offset="10613217">So, when they said sexual immorality and the discussion was this, that unless you try by outlining in specific detail the acts of fornications, that you can -- you've gone as far as you need to go when you use the term “sexual immorality.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.050" offset="10711542">That that is a clear expression of language which everybody understands and which everybody knows.</text>

            <text syncTime="2725.642" offset="11005889">And then, in addiction to that, it does exactly, as Justice Stewart said a moment ago, it depicts adultery which everybody all through the years has recognized as improper.</text>

            <text syncTime="2752.736" offset="11114350">Now, the legislature has set that up of a -- as a standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="2770.056" offset="11183626">Now, if that standard is no good, why, then, the legislature has failed to do what it tried to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.305" offset="11216541">But if that standard is a reasonable one, and I think that the Regents were convinced that it was and I'm sure that the people that endorsed the decision of Justice -- of Judge Conway felt that it was, if that's a reasonable standard, then, I think, that it ought to permissible for the State of New York to decide that this is the type of procedure that we want followed in the licensure because, now, once again, I want to go back to that we're licensing motion pictures and we're licensing under a degree of a standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.825" offset="11346631">And, if they meet these standards, we have no choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.577" offset="11357706">What I said in my brief, and let me reiterate it here, is that the legislature and not the Regents have said that this picture should not be shown.</text>

            <text syncTime="3086.477" offset="12449311">We have not had a case where there's any rejection ever been raised where our power to licensure has been challenged.</text>

            <text syncTime="3125.307" offset="12604583">But, I regard this as a method and an educational method because I do think that that has something to do with this problem, an educational method of entrusting to people who are dealing statewide with this whole problem of education to determine whether motion pictures should or not be licensed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.265" offset="12692459">And, I say that the only problem that I see and the only problem in this case that I see, and I hope that it's a narrow one, as to whether this particular picture comes within the present statutory standards which have been laid down by the legislature.</text>
