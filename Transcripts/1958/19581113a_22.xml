            <label>Mr. Edward J. Malament</label>
            <text syncTime="20.618" offset="185866">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirming an order of the District Court for the Southern District setting aside a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiff and dismissing his complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.146" offset="279907">The action was brought by the plaintiff-petitioner to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by him in 1948 while a guest of a crew member on the S. S. Oregon, a passenger vessel owned by the defendant-respondent cooperation.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.703" offset="386173">The vessel at the time was berthed at a pier in the North River in the port of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.319" offset="420655">The complaint alleged the negligence of the defendant, the unseaworthiness of the vessel and set forth the diversity of the parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.973" offset="483244">The accident which gives rise to the suit occurred out of the following circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.071" offset="535698">A crew member by the name of Yves of the S. S. Oregon obtained a pass from the commanding officer of the vessel so that Kermarec could visit him aboard the vessel when the vessel arrived in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.559" offset="625560">This pass was issued in accordance with the customary practice permitting crew members to entertain guests that visit their family aboard the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.086" offset="671744">This pass was obtained by the crew member and was retained by him throughout this incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.039" offset="707480">It was never shown the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.353" offset="712808">It was never explained to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.145" offset="719914">He never saw and knew its contents.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.659" offset="730049">And in due course pursuant to arrangement, Kermarec boarded the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.329" offset="760665">After some time and as he was leaving, the visit -- the visit having terminated, Yves, the crew member directed him to a central stairway, a stairway used in common by passengers as well as by crew members.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.747" offset="858363">The stairway at the time was covered by a canvas runner, a single piece of linen about an eighth of an inch thick, which ran the entire length of the stairway.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.958" offset="915205">Photographs of the stairway including the affixed canvas runner are attached to the transcript at pages 89 and 91.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.562" offset="981661">As Kermarec started to descend the stairway, it appeared to him in all respects normal and safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.775" offset="1010500">About four steps from the bottom however, the canvas suddenly slipped from under his feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.613" offset="1037876">He fell to the bottom of the stairway fracturing his hip.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.361" offset="1056789">As he was lying on the deck at the base of the stairway, he noticed that the canvas was hanging loose from the edge of the fourth step.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.126" offset="1111855">The testimony for the most part is uncontested and is obtained chiefly from the defendant's own witnesses by way of deposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.094" offset="1155741">That it was the routine and customary practice for a porter, by the name of Bourdon to wash, cleans the stairway and to cover it with a canvas runner as soon as the vessel arrived in port, to keep it clean until the new batch of passengers embark.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.558" offset="1241631">And the facts disclosed that the vessel had arrived the day preceding the accident at which time Bourdon had performed the routine duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.450" offset="1285204">And that at 8 o'clock the following morning, the day of the accident, he had to remove the canvas and wash the stairs a second time because of what appeared to be the heavy traffic of the crew on the stairway causing the need within less than 24 hours of renewing the cleanliness of the stairway.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.584" offset="1377677">This witness also testified that he had been instructed to keep this canvas runner tight so there would be no trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.908" offset="1426996">The testimony further is clear that he affixed the stairway, the canvas runner to the stairway by the use of two tacks at the front edge of each step, the two tacks being at the extreme edge -- edges of the canvas runner.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.573" offset="1509648">On one of the photographs, I think on page 90, Bourdon, the porter, marked two crosses indicating the place where he affixed the two tacks on each step.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.283" offset="1600554">The copy in the transcript is not too clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.397" offset="1612988">If the Court has any difficulty seeing the two crosses, we have photographs which make that a little bit clearer.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.591" offset="1649768">Now, the two tacks which were used for each of these two steps about 12 or 14 in all were the normal carpet size tacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.795" offset="1698565">And Bourdon, the porter, in court made a diagram of what those tacks looked like -- looked like, and you can find those, Your Honor, on page 89.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.764" offset="1766379">It is conceded that these two tacks per step were the only means used to keep the canvas against the stairway.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.086" offset="1807757">There were no tacks at the rear of the step holding the canvas toward the rear of the step.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.532" offset="1833462">There were no tacks used or other means to keep the canvas firm and straight against the riser to the step above.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.726" offset="1886229">And Mr. Bourdon also testified, without contradiction, that it was quite easy to remove this canvas runner and the tacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.726" offset="1938265">And in his own words, it was simply, “You take hold of the canvas and the tacks come out by themselves.”</text>
            <text syncTime="476.423" offset="2009109">This case was tried twice to a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.776" offset="2026454">On the first trial, there was a disagreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.539" offset="2045576">On the second trial, before the second trial judge, the Court dismissed the course of action on the basis of unseaworthiness and ruled that in this case, a maritime tort was not tendered to the Court for adjudication, notwithstanding the undeniable testimony that the accident had occurred on an oceangoing vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.530" offset="2157484">The accident had occurred on the vessel while the vessel was berthed in navigable waters, that the accident occurred on the vessel due to a defectively maintained canvas runner on a ship stairway, that the accident occurred because of an invitation from a crew member in a foreign port, who had a friend visit him with the authorized consent and knowledge of the shipowner notwithstanding that the complaint raised the general maritime law questions and issues of negligence and unseaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.007" offset="2327385">Because the Court was convinced that this was not a maritime tort which was tendered to him, he felt obliged to apply the law of New York and accordingly said and held that contributory negligence would be a defense and not comparative negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.119" offset="2403871">And compelled by the conclusion that this was not a maritime tort, he ruled out the application of the doctrine of unseaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.391" offset="2440965">He further held that the plaintiff-petitioner was a licensee, the words “mere licensee”, “bare licensee”, “gratuitous licensee” were used.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.071" offset="2483702">And accordingly under what he thought to be the applicable law of New York, the jury was charged that the plaintiff could not be covered unless the jury found that the shipowner had actual knowledge that the stairway created a dangerous condition which the shipowner either failed to repair or warn the petitioner about.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.463" offset="2629256">Because of the restrictive clause as to liability on the pass, the trial judge also charged the jury that the pass would not be binding upon the plaintiff unless the jury found that the contents of the pass had been brought to the plaintiff's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.441" offset="2709086">The jury brought in the verdict for the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.244" offset="2736358">Now, thereafter upon motion, the judge, in a rather brief memorandum opinion, dismissed the complaint instead of first set aside the verdict than dismiss the complaint on the ground that there was a complete absence of proof that the shipowner-defendant knew that this stairway presented a dangerous condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.475" offset="2865298">The court below affirmed by divided court, Judges Watermen and I believe, Harlan --</text>

            <text syncTime="1210.205" offset="4944227">I turn then now to the question as to whether or not this troublesome question of the doctrine of unseaworthiness is or should be applicable to the authorized guest of a seaman aboard the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.804" offset="5030640">It is only 14 years, I believe, since the Mahnich decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.828" offset="5050702">All together this doctrine has had a development under the auspices of this Court of less than 55 years, Osceola, 1903.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.220" offset="5096260">In the past decade, this Court has developed the doctrine to the point where it is not only applicable to seamen but to longshoremen and to non-longshoremen, old men who are doing the equivalence of ship's work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.390" offset="5168880">It has gone beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.479" offset="5173269">It has said that the logic of the doctrine and for the reasons that gave it rise the doctrine should apply whether or not the ship or its appurtenance becomes unseaworthy through negligent maintenance as the Mahnich case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.009" offset="5247457">It has held that the doctrine applies whether or not the appurtenance is brought on to the vessel by the stevedore or the longshoreman and even though the appurtenance of the new equipment that's brought on may be under the control of the longshoreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.463" offset="5321226">It has said that when a member of a crew, that's the Alaska-Petterson case, this Court has held that when a member of the crew is not equal in temperament to the ordinary seaman aboard the vessel and such seaman injures another with a dangerous weapon, that unequal seaman also creates an unseaworthy condition that were joined up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.307" offset="5440554">These recent decisions by the Court, as we see it, are grounded on two premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.899" offset="5482977">The first that the nature of a maritime operation onboard a commercial vessel was still a hazardous occupation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.356" offset="5524773">But in view of the highly-industrialized nature of modern merchant marine, many new classifications of workers are exposed to the hazards which, at one time, confronted only the seamen in the days of the sailing vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.933" offset="5603140">The danger remains the same in 1958 as before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.622" offset="5625814">The second rationale for these recent decisions is that as between the victim of an unseaworthy condition and his dependants, the shipowner still remains best able to assume and spread the risk in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.457" offset="5689240">That without the protection of this liberal doctrine, victims of unseaworthy appurtenances who are not able to discover it or remove it may be left without a remedy if they are required to prove their case under the usual laws of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.519" offset="5793416">Perhaps as was to be anticipated, these recent decisions have left the maritime bar and bench in some degree of uncertainty as to the ultimate scope of the doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.165" offset="5852035">I think in one of our footnotes, we have collated the cases which arose in the last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.092" offset="5871783">I doubt that there is a circuit that had -- had one or more of these cases before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.016" offset="5891427">I know that this Court in the brief history of this term has already heard argument on two such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.674" offset="5918072">Now, one says ours presents an extreme situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.006" offset="5935417">We cannot come within any immediate translation of ship's work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.859" offset="5970840">And yet we urge upon the Court that the reasons which gave rise to the extension of the doctrine are applicable to anyone who has was injured aboard a vessel in furtherance of the welfare or the operation of the vessel whether in direct or indirect degree because otherwise an anomalous situation develops.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.238" offset="6124335">The longshoreman, the carpenter can be protected but what about the governmental inspector, the immigration official, the customs guard or coast guard agent?</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.486" offset="6189328">What about the host of other classifications who necessarily must visit a vessel with the knowledge and consent of the shipowner in order to conduct a modern and safe merchant marine?</text>

            <text syncTime="1751.565" offset="7109674">Anyway, coming back -- so that I could pass this point of unseaworthiness, the courts have been troubled by the doctrine and they have taken two views, which I've attempted to explain and describe in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.347" offset="7168711">There are those who indicate a -- a -- an antipathy toward the doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.645" offset="7189922">They don't like it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.211" offset="7196191">They talk pretty colloquially.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.064" offset="7203610">And they are restricting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.522" offset="7213432">There are those, on the other hand, who believe that the logic of the doctrine should be extended to its ultimate conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.733" offset="7250317">And whether the Court decides it today or in the future, without any way attempting to -- to urge upon the Court a waiver or a modification of its usual reluctance to meet an issue unless it's necessary, I pose these two questions to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.410" offset="7325027">If the block and tackle which had brought aboard the vessel by a longshoreman or stevedore is defective and as a result, a sling load falls injuring another longshoreman, that longshoreman may recover from the vessel on the ground of unseaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.952" offset="7415202">But assume that the same block and tackle broke, the same sling load fell and instead of hitting a longshoreman or a seaman, it hits one of these inspectors who are on the vessel, should it make any difference?</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.253" offset="7468387">Let me put it another way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.759" offset="7478418">The same man who runs amuck and who knives a crew member or a longshoreman in -- the victim can recover because the vessel has rendered unseaworthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.573" offset="7525648">But suppose the same victim, the same seaman should injure the -- the union official that comes aboard to -- to settle some grievances under the collective bargaining agreement or the marine insurance underwriting investigator who comes aboard to investigate a claim, should that make any difference what the status of the victim is in a situation where the vessel itself is unseaworthy?</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.468" offset="7637243">And when we ask this Court to transcribe and extend the doctrine to its logical conclusion, all we're asking the Court to -- to enlarge the responsibility in reality of the shipowner who must, by law, provide a seaworthy vessel or are we by that asking and guaranteeing that the shipowner will buy that much more, execute his responsibility and make sure that the vessel is seaworthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.785" offset="7766497">This is the scope of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.364" offset="7780812">The case in which the Court has utterly divided do not compel them to go as far as I would have the Court go on the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.681" offset="7814144">But eventually the question of whether a man who was lawfully aboard the vessel must be answered as to whether or not the doctrine extends to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.889" offset="7846954">It'll be better if the Court should hold that it does extend to an invitee as distinguished from a licensee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.350" offset="7872763">But the minute the Court begins to affix this status, that it's more important to the law, the general admiralty law, the confusion which I will now address myself to, which should not be permitted, namely, the classification should not be used at least so far as the federal maritime law is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.471" offset="7949249">Now, with respect to my third point, as I've said before, this Court has never definitively stated the duty owed to a lawfully authorized visitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.104" offset="8015809">And we have indicated the confusion which now exists, we only, I think, for our purposes, direct the Court's attention to the occupiers -- the -- the 1957 Act passed in England in -- which abolished the distinction between licensee and invitee and imposed a single standard of care upon all persons or upon all occupiers in favor of persons lawfully upon the premises whether or not the premises were movable or fixed including vessel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2396.834" offset="9690676">It takes into account that it's in the interest of the shipowner to keep his men aboard the vessel in our modern day, when tankers and passenger vessels and even commercial vessels keep tight schedules and meet the tide sometime within 12 hours so that the realities of life are that the average seaman must transact his personal business aboard the vessels, see his friends, see his family, take care of personal needs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2646.094" offset="10687718">But assuming that this is not the kind of the affirmative act of negligence which would make the shipowner responsible, we have a second proposition which is recognized by the authorities, that the condition of the stairway, the condition of the stairway was known to the employee who had created the condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.770" offset="10774444">And there were other cases which hold that where the condition is known by the employee or created by the employee, whether or not that condition is a dangerous condition, is a matter of the objective test of reasonable knowledge of notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.474" offset="10849259">And applying the doctrine, the facts of the case through the last situation, the licensee situation, I should like to read from this one paragraph of the brief in which I say, on page 31, as to the first question as to whether a dangerous condition existed, the question was not only the size or the adequacy of the facts but whether considering the length of the runner, the canvas runner, the heavy traffic on the stairway, two carpet tacks removable by hand alone and placed only at the front-end -- at -- at the front of each tread with nothing to hold the canvas in place at the rear of the step or against the riser to the step above were sufficient to keep the canvas from coming loose and slipping both the step under the cumulative weight and the repeating jarring of those using the stairway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.543" offset="11101497">We may assume that had a sufficient number of tacks been used, the canvas could have been held in place, but the question before the jury was simply whether two tacks alone were enough under the circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.338" offset="11148727">To say therefore, as did the court below that there was no evidence that the tacks were inadequate for their purpose, in whatever sense the term adequate was used, is simply to ignore the evidence and defy reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.041" offset="11195538">The jury unquestionably could find and then, that a dangerous condition existed on the stairway as Kermarec started to descend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.869" offset="11262830">If Kermarec was a licensee, he was entitled to his verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.319" offset="11292609">And as we pointed out before, where courts have been divided on the facts in the law and where two juries have disagreed, can one say under the circumstances that a reasonable man could not have differed and that there was no evidence to justify the verdict.</text>

            <text syncTime="3160.090" offset="12743764">Mr. Chief Justice, and all the members of this bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.958" offset="12767169">I will not belabor the Court with the repetition of the facts, except to point out perhaps two or three things that were not referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.911" offset="12811055">It was -- I don't think that the plaintiff here, the petitioner makes any contention that the visit to this vessel was solely for social reason, wholly unrelated to the business of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.071" offset="12883675">In that, the injured man, a native-born Frenchman but naturalized and United States citizen wanted to bring aboard the vessel a package to a friend who was a steward on the ship and who in turn would bring that package to France.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.942" offset="12975104">The package served no purpose in the furtherance of the -- of the ship's business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.197" offset="13000182">He arrived aboard the vessel at about noon on the -- over the gangway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.074" offset="13027662">He visited in the -- in his friend's room until between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.971" offset="13059218">There was some drink to be -- had there and he went to a bar too for purpose of having a drink.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.337" offset="13088684">At about 5 o'clock, he admitted that he was in a hurry to leave the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.119" offset="13119822">And he took a stairway of whether -- either 10 or 12 steps, which have been covered by what is known as ship's canvas, about the thickness of a paper match cover, or perhaps an eight of an inch in thickness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.822" offset="13178650">And customarily that -- that cover, or one like it, was put on the steps while the ship was moored in New York harbor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.715" offset="13210206">And it was secured by tacks which ran through not only the canvas, but also the rubber covering on the side, on the thread but also into the wood beneath.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.751" offset="13266422">That is the undisputed testimony</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.493" offset="13277393">.There was drawing made that the taking of the deposition I have the exhibits here, if the Court decides to see any of them, I'd be very glad to leave them here, the original photographs, the drawing and -- and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.374" offset="13336848">Now, it is true he said that the tacks could be removed by lifting the -- the canvas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.733" offset="13366314">Well, I -- I think we, perhaps, are all familiar that even in our households that the general way for removing a carpet from any stairway is not by screwdriver or -- or a hammer but generally, you can lift it up without too much force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.557" offset="13433605">That's how it was done customarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.937" offset="13447084">This -- cover had been put on the stairway at about 8 o'clock that morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.480" offset="13469341">Some nine hours had gone by when this accident happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.781" offset="13494523">The man who laid it had gone up and down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.324" offset="13508629">One of the other men, a man by the name of Dufy had used it at least eight or 10 times that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.035" offset="13539558">When the accident happened, the plaintiff when -- he said it looked all right to him, he descended to four steps to the bottom when he says that the -- that his foot slipped or the canvas slipped under his foot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.170" offset="13600057">It so happened that he didn't go to a hospital until the following day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.208" offset="13624195">And then in the history on the hospital, he said he didn't know just how the accident did happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.891" offset="13642898">But he said that the only step even now -- even while he looked at it from the bottom stairway that appeared to be in any way out of order was the fourth one, all the other steps the -- the canvas was in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.686" offset="13694098">As a matter of fact, two of his friends or one of his friends and another member of the crew went down that same stairway immediately after the accident and went up again and found nothing wrong with the stairway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.801" offset="13742582">Now, I -- I concede that there has been no clarification at the level of this Court as to the status of a person such as -- since a man was, and whether or not he is entitled to the rights of the seaworthy doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.521" offset="13817501">However, I do feel -- and I'm not in -- in dispute nor do I in any way voice any displeasure with the laws as has been expressed by this Court in reference to longshoremen, their rights of the -- of the seaworthy doctrine to fully recover the rights that a member of the crew could, nor a carpenter who's engaged in making safe the ship, or anyone else who's furthering the business of the ship because they are all exposed to the hazards that the -- that the seamen themselves who had been in -- in other days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.526" offset="13953442">But even this Court has said in the Pope &amp; Talbot case, has pointed out that even as between a longshoreman or a carpenter, whatever the case may be, that he does not have all the rights that a sea -- that -- that a member of the crew has.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.493" offset="14029302">It was pointed out by this Court that he is limited to recovery for personal injuries and for a pain suffering, for loss of wages but it was pointed out that he is not entitled to the right of maintenance and cure, which a -- a member of the crew has.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.085" offset="14107669">Now, there is a distinction and this Court recognized it, as to the rights and the limitation of the rights as between a -- a crew member and someone else who has come into part of the -- of the work of what formerly was performed by a member of the crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.547" offset="14173602">Now, I -- I believe that this is not a maritime tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.082" offset="14195649">I think it comes under the doctrine of common law rights and obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.215" offset="14216234">And if that is so, I think the doctrine as applied in the -- in this case was promptly followed by the Court in its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.732" offset="14262314">I think that the relationship here was that of a -- a social visitor who has no right of recovery except where there is a hidden trap or where there's wanton or willful misconduct on the part of the host, with whom he is visiting or unless this is an affirmative act of negligence created after the arrival on the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.261" offset="14360430">There might be a guest on your -- in your stable or your farm or whatever it might be, and if you operate a normal bill, of course, that will be one form of affirmative negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.672" offset="14402017">Well, in this instance here, there is no proof that there was anything that was done wrong which would -- created the trap for the honorary person such as the plaintiff in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.996" offset="14451336">Hours had gone by, the -- the stairway had been used for many hours by several people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.080" offset="14475682">It was -- there was no proof that there was anything unusual about the type of tack, or that was inadequate or that it had not served this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.371" offset="14512880">As a matter of fact, the proof in the case to the contrary, that was the kind of tack that was customarily used in -- of tacking down the -- the canvas on the ship on -- on this and other occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.298" offset="14560528">Now, I have not attempted, Your Honors, as it's obvious from my brief, to have answered all of the citations referred to by counsel for the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.368" offset="14612877">And my brief would have been much longer than this Court would perhaps have the patience to -- to look at.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.382" offset="14640880">Essentially, I think that this is a common law case that he was a social visitor and was entitled to the rights as defined not only by Judge Lumbard in the prevailing majority opinion but also I'd say to the -- the authorities in New York, because I believe that the law of New York should govern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.788" offset="14714546">Now, that -- those reference here of -- of some time ago by one of the justices to the effect that there is a difference between one person and another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.510" offset="14757386">The Galveston case is a classic example of it decided by the Court of Appeals and -- and which a -- a writ was denied by this Court and the -- on the rehearing, it was also denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.936" offset="14811094">And it was pointed out there that the father who's the master of the ship could recover because his relationship was that of -- in the nature of crew worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.430" offset="14853099">But the son who was merely a social visitor was not entitled to recover.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.540" offset="14869504">I don't think that -- that if there is to be a change of the rights as defined in the cases that have come and -- before the courts up to this point, if there is to be a change, I -- I think it should be by a legislation and not by -- by the decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.925" offset="14939094">That was what was done in England.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.053" offset="14947558">Apparently, it was considered over there, to the need of the change of the rights owing to what the business prestige should be done by legislation.</text>
