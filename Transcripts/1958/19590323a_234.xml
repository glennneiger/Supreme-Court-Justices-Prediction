            <text syncTime="22.683" offset="194121">Thank you for very much -- now, Mr. Friedman, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="26.814" offset="210631">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.995" offset="223378">The principal issue in this case which is here on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is whether the prohibitions in the Fur Product Labeling Act against false and deceptive invoicing are applicable to invoicing at the retail level, that is when a retail courier sells a fur product to the ultimate consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.965" offset="319195">There's a second issue in the case which I'll discuss subsequently dealing with the scope of the cease-and-desist order entered by the Federal Trade Commission in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.473" offset="357230">At the outset, I would just like to sketch briefly for the Court, since this is the first time this statute is before the Court, what in broad terms it purports to do and why we believe that the court below has misconstrued it.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.640" offset="409893">The Fur Product Labeling Act was passed in 1951 after extensive congressional consideration by three different congresses.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.075" offset="447718">One thing we think that stands out in connection with the history of this Act is that there was a clear congressional purpose to protect the ultimate consumer of fur products.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.019" offset="491499">The statute basically sets up in Section 3 a general prohibition against the sale or distribution of fur or fur products which are falsely or deceptively invoiced, falsely or deceptively advertised or misbranded.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.082" offset="563702">And then the section of the statute goes on in the next two sections and specifies the conditions under which that event would occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.829" offset="594735">It states to them basically the provisions are substantially the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.359" offset="612812">It states that a fur product is misbranded if there is not attached to it a label which sets forth a certain specified items of information, particularly the name of the animal in accordance with a certain standard, the country of origin of imported furs.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.313" offset="680626">And if in fact there was any used fur, any inferior part of the animal or any dyed fur, that information must be set forth on the label.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.604" offset="717824">Similarly, the statute goes on and requires substantially the same information to be attached to an invoice.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="159.674" stopTime="168.093">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="159.674" offset="742066">Is there any difference between the courier in the information that goes on the label and require you to go on the label on that statute, or require your to go in the invoice?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="168.093" stopTime="313.601">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="168.093" offset="775711">Only in one minor particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.758" offset="782399">The label requires the name of the manufacturer, the invoice requires the name and address of the seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.877" offset="802879">Other than that, they are substantially the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.211" offset="820224">I want to emphasize at the outset that when we speak of labels in this field, we do not refer to the traditional kind of label of a piece of cloth that is sown on the lining of the garment.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.769" offset="878425">The label that are used in this business are really called, really tags.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.553" offset="897546">They set forth two examples on the page 64(a) of the record and 66(b) of the record, that these little tags that are attached either to the arm of the garment or to the button, and they just hang there.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.554" offset="953553">And we think this is very crucial because as I shall develop in a moment, we think that the temporary character of the label or the tag means that merely giving this information to the purchaser by this means does not give the purchaser the full measure of protection which we think Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.395" offset="1032965">We think that Congress intended to go beyond this, and also to give her as a permanent record, the information contained on the invoice.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.313" offset="1064626">The respondent in this case operates a large department store in the City of Chicago, and after proper administrative proceedings, the Federal Trade Commission entered a cease-and-desist order finding that respondent had violated all three of these provisions, misbranding, false and deceptive invoicing and false and deceptive advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.119" offset="1143829">The Court of Appeals modified the order with respect to misbranding, finding it was too broad in scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.719" offset="1170265">And in addition, completely struck the provision relating to false invoicing.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.746" offset="1190327">The Court reached this conclusion solely by looking to the statutory definition of invoice and it ruled that this definition was so clear on its face that there was no need to have resort to legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.323" offset="1248632">And we think that this construction is erroneous because first, we believe that the definition of invoice when viewed in light of the other provisions of the Act, does apply to retail invoicing and particularly when the legislative history in the purpose of Congress in passing the statute be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.640" offset="1321984">And I would now like to turn to the specific statutory provisions involved in this case, which is set forth through pages 36 and 37 of our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="765.479" offset="3165288">Now, the Court of Appeals picked up the definition of invoice in Section 2 (f) of the Act, at page 36 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.518" offset="3205413">I'd like to read to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.247" offset="3212309">It says, “The term “invoice” means a written account, a memorandum, list or catalog, which is issued in connection with any commercial dealing in fur products or furs and described the particulars of any fur products or furs transported or delivered to a purchaser, consignee, factor, bailee, correspondent, or agent, or any other person who is engaged in dealing commercially in fur products or furs.”</text>
            <text syncTime="804.016" offset="3319411">The Court of Appeals stated that under this definition, an invoice at the retail level is not covered because the Court said first, “The invoice which is given by the retail dealer to the consumer is not issued in connection with any commercial dealing in fur products or furs.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.799" offset="3398614">Secondly,” the Court said, “that the last clause of this definition or any other person who is engaged in dealing commercially in fur products or furs must be read back as modifying not only any other person but also agent, bailee, or purchaser and therefore, it reasons that since the retail purchaser is not engaged in dealing commercially in fur products or furs, the sales slip given to that purchaser is not an invoice within the meaning of the statute.”</text>
            <text syncTime="857.060" offset="3531630">We believe that this reading of the statute is too narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.889" offset="3550960">We think that a fair reading of the statute is that Congress state that the term “invoice” means a written account or memorandum issued in connection with any commercial dealing in fur products or furs.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.085" offset="3611669">And we think clearly, the sale by the retail store to the customer is a commercial dealing in fur product, which is -- delivered to a purchaser, consignee, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.940" offset="3655137">In other words, Congress specified a number of particular individuals to whom an invoice must be given, and then added a catch-all phrase covering any other person who is engaged in dealing commercially in fur product or furs.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.329" offset="3720652">We believe that this result follows not only from the language of this statute itself but further from the basic congressional policy reflected in the history of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.778" offset="3770493">The Act in the committee report states its purpose is being to protect consumers and others against false and deceptive advertising, false and deceptive invoicing and misbranding.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.177" offset="3820126">We have set forth in our brief some of the legislative history of this statute which shows that when the Act first came before the committees for consideration, witnesses of the fur industry testified as to the importance to the retail consumer of a good invoice.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.140" offset="3887940">It's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.147" offset="3891911">They stated in this connection that they thought an invoice was better than a label and they made this contention as my adversary emphasizes because they didn't want any legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.975" offset="3931303">They said, “Don't require us to label, but if we have to do anything, an invoice is preferable to a label.”</text>
            <text syncTime="963.279" offset="3956485">Now, Congress didn't accept that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.742" offset="3966307">Congress included a ban in Section 3 (b) upon the manufacture for sale of any fur product made in whole or in part of fur shipped in interstate commerce, which is misbranded or falsely or deceptively advertised or falsely or deceptively imports.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.628" offset="4037883">The testimony before the Congress also emphasize the importance of invoicing because of the transitory character of the label which hangs on the coat.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.176" offset="4092113">As one of the witnesses representing the fur industry stated to the Court, purchases “are more likely to throw away a tag than a proper invoice.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.122" offset="4131819">Now, the construction adopted by the Court of Appeals would have this effect, all the way along the chain of transactions by which a fur coat is manufactured and gets to the hand of the ultimate consumer, there is both the label and an invoice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.736" offset="4202350">However, at the time the ultimate consumer gets the coat, at this point, it's cut short.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.391" offset="4228890">All she gets is the tag, this little thing hanging there, which I think it's a fair inference, people will have to throw away.</text>

            <text syncTime="3767.467" offset="15173256">Well, for one thing on the -- the invoicing question, it depends altogether on the interpretation of this term "invoice".</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.735" offset="15234278">I -- short -- I used a shorthand reference to it a moment ago or -- or other commercially dealing person, purchaser, consignee, factor, bailee or other commercially dealing person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.909" offset="15298957">And I would like to point out just briefly the parallel between the language, that language and the language that the Court had before it in United States versus Standard Brewery, that's cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3813.260" offset="15356426">The statute prohibited use of food products in the manufacture or production of beer, wine, or other intoxicating liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.479" offset="15385266">And the Court held that -- or other intoxicating liquor referred back and modified beer and wine and it had to be intoxicating beer before it was in that prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.768" offset="15422464">Similarly, we say that this clause, commercially dealing person, goes back and modifies that -- enumeration of the persons who are concerned with the handling of furs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.524" offset="15489442">Now, you'll want to know, I think, why we say that it's reasonable that Congress should have required the invoicing of fur products from the manufacturer to the retailer and not require it from the retailer to the -- to the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3869.901" offset="15582960">The reason for that, it seems to us, is found in the fact that you're intervening persons, your wholesaler, your jobber or your retailer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3878.289" offset="15616502">Each one is responsible for seeing that the garment has a proper label on it before it goes forward from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3886.446" offset="15649207">If the wholesaler, the jobber, the retailer has a statutory invoice, a statutorily detailed invoice, he has something against which he can check the correctness of the invoice, of the label for which he is responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3904.650" offset="15721932">But the consumer doesn't have any responsibility to pass -- pass it on to anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3910.244" offset="15744397">And the consumer had -- does have the full protection of the required statutory label.</text>
            <text syncTime="3921.128" offset="15787865">There was a mention of the testimony in the hearings in the 80th Congress, where this whole legislation originated, the fur dealers and processors and manufacturers were about the only witnesses that were in there, except to -- to irrelevant groups that were barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3946.860" offset="15890787">They were opposing the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.225" offset="15896221">They were opposing any legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3949.573" offset="15901654">They were opposing labeling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3952.173" offset="15912103">When they advocated invoicing to be observed, they didn't advocate invoicing but we touched them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3958.351" offset="15936763">They advocated invoicing by somebody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3964.977" offset="15963303">The -- at the outset of those hearings, I have been testimony by a representative from the Federal Trade Commission who had recommended labeling as the remedy for the bills of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3980.848" offset="16026728">At the close of those hearings and how it's in the 80th, the sponsor of the bill, Congressman O'Hara, called as if -- he's the representative, if I could stand and ask if he could add anything to testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3992.373" offset="16072913">He reaffirmed his previous advocacy of labeling then he turned to the suggestion of invoicing as being -- as against labeling.</text>
            <text syncTime="4004.824" offset="16122650">And he said, “Labeling would be a more effective remedy than invoicing because the label gives the customer facts before the -- before she makes her choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4014.465" offset="16161207">The invoice comes after."</text>
            <text syncTime="4015.655" offset="16166013">Then he said it would be like locking the barn door after the horse is stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="4019.906" offset="16183045">He also went on the comment, "There is no burden on the manufacturer's invoice, but there is a burden on the retailer to give an invoice at the time to every sale."</text>
