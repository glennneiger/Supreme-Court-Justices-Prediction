            <text syncTime="553.024" offset="2315473">Now, in the Court of Appeals and the trial judge relied very heavily upon the Spies case on the question of concealment as to whether or not evidence of concealment was sufficient to show a conspiracy to evade and defeat the payment of a federal tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.140" offset="2399901">Now, of course, the Spies case was a substantive case.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.172" offset="2412022">It was not a conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.236" offset="2420276">Spies had admitted, at the opening of the trial, that he had failed to pay the tax and that the tax was due and, therefore, had admitted a misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.449" offset="2457161">The only question in the Spies case was whether evidence of concealment was sufficient to raise the offense from the degree of a misdemeanor of failing to pay to the degree of a felony of attempting to evade and defeat its payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.848" offset="2514735">And, of course, this Court held that evidence of concealment was sufficient to show that.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.792" offset="2542529">But, now, in the -- in the present case, we say that the present case is inapplicable to the Spies case for these three different reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.470" offset="2577220">First, the only question in the Spies case involved was wether a misdemeanor or a felony applied and, therefore, the evidence of concealment was necessary for the Government to prove in order to raise it from a misdemeanor to the felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.308" offset="2636570">Second, we say that the concealment in that case was of items directly related to income.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.152" offset="2663946">In other words, the -- the falsification of books or the hiding of income or anything of that nature directly related to income would tend to raise it from a misdemeanor to a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.159" offset="2708041">And, the third thing that distinguishes it is that that charge was a charge it -- was a substantive charge and concealment was one of direct elements involved in the charge against Spies to raise it from a misdemeanor to a felony, whereas, in the case at bar, being a felony conspiracy and the evidence concededly showing that these other the petitioners were not, or at least two of them, perhaps maybe the third one, but at least two of them, it's been conceded by the Court of Appeals and conceded when the jury found them not guilty, that they were not themselves liable to the payment of tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.571" offset="2861641">And, here, the Government comes in and attempts to use evidence of concealment as direct evidence to show that they had violated the federal law, whereas, in Spies case, that situation was entirely different.</text>

            <text syncTime="1334.165" offset="5440031">Now, we contend this also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.411" offset="5449017">I'd like to make this point clear to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.124" offset="5459884">That Ingram, the banker, cannot be guilty of a conspiracy because he cannot conspire with himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.182" offset="5480051">Just merely the fact that he would be required to pay the tax would not make him guilty of a conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.248" offset="5504397">If -- if the Court finds that he was required to pay the tax and of course -- and if he was the only one that did not conspire with any of these other persons who were engaged as employees, then, of course, he could not be convicted of the conspiracy, and that is the only thing that he was convicted of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.158" offset="5563956">Now, one other thing I would like to bring to the attention of the Court and that is this, that there are two different types of conspiracies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.491" offset="5593318">There's a main conspiracy and a subsidiary conspiracy, and these rules were laid down in the Grunewald, Lutwak, and Krulewitch cases by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.533" offset="5629471">And, the teaching of those cases means this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.633" offset="5645876">That if the object of a conspiracy embraces concealment as a necessary ingredient of the substantive offense itself, then concealment belongs to the main conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.784" offset="5690493">Whereas, if the object of concealment is to escape detection, prosecution, and punishment, it -- it is merely a subsidiary conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.195" offset="5724139">Now, the Court of Appeals in this case held that the purpose of the concealment was to avoid detection from -- detention, prosecution, and punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.985" offset="5763323">If that be the case, then, of course, it is merely a subsidiary conspiracy to conceal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.532" offset="5785475">It was not a part of the substantive offense -- or the -- the object of the conspiracy itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.668" offset="5810030">And, being subsidiary, then the proof of it would not tend to prove the main conspiracy itself and there is no evidence in this case which would prove the main conspiracy itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1475.778" offset="6006471">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.289" offset="6024547">Some of the gambling terminology used in this case is different from that in Calamaro.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.920" offset="6047013">In Calamaro, there was involved the writer, the writer being the person who receives the wager from the beter for and on behalf of the banker, the person you has the financial risk in the wager.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.864" offset="6098840">The evidence indicated that the pickup man involved in that enterprise was simply a messenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.213" offset="6132276">This Court held in Calamaro that the pickup man was not liable for the special stamp tax since he was not, within the meaning of the statute, receiving wagers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.737" offset="6178356">Now, there was expert testimony in this case as to a typical large lottery operation in Atlanta.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.112" offset="6203852">In Atlanta, you have the writer and the banker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.765" offset="6214405">A pickup man was very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.689" offset="6226108">A pickup man would be a writer who would supervise other writers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.738" offset="6250350">He would recruit writers and it's his job to see that the -- the tickets were all picked up by a certain time so that they would be in the hands of trusted personnel of the banker before the winning number became known in Atlanta.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.896" offset="6322970">There's also a ribbon man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.048" offset="6335613">Now, a ribbon man, in essence, is a banker who is laying-off bets with another larger banker and his --his compensation is the weigh of percentage from the other banker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.023" offset="6399457">There is testimony as to that, expert testimony as to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.457" offset="6413249">Now, the mere messenger which would be comparable to the pickup man in Calamaro was called a drag man, a sack man, or a pickup boy and it was his job to carry the tickets from points in Atlanta, usually what they called a stash, a place where they hid the tickets or after they were delivered to him from the pickup man, to carry the tickets from Atlanta to a rendezvous outside of Atlanta in the countryside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.122" offset="6539891">And, there, the drag man or the sack man, as he's called, would deliver these tickets to the headquarters personnel and, sometimes, to the banker at this rendezvous location.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.446" offset="6601122">Now, there was a check up -- what they called, in this case, a check up headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.582" offset="6625677">That is the -- was a place out in the countryside in Atlanta, a secret place, where the tickets were checked over to find if there were any winning numbers and to make up the records necessary for settling accounts between the writers, the pick up man, and the banker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.865" offset="6698820">This location was, it was testified, usually kept secrets from the mere messenger because of the fact that the messenger, if apprehended, would be inclined to cooperate with the law enforcement officers and reveal the location of this secret headquarters out in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.524" offset="6777501">This headquarters changed periodically so that it wouldn't be detected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.959" offset="6803205">The headquarters -- there were also involved in the operation in Atlanta people called the headquarters personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.080" offset="6835702">These people were certainly more than mere clerks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.566" offset="6853674">They knew the location of the secret check up headquarters where the tickets were going over and the records prepared for the simple reason that they work there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.815" offset="6894634">They had to be personnel who were close to and trusted by the banker for the simple reason that, at the time that they worked with the tickets, was a time after the winning number had become known and, if their interests weren't -- didn't coincide with those of the banker, they could slip in, on their own behalf, winning numbers, and this could be quite ruinous to the banker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.066" offset="6995675">It was testified by expert witness that the headquarters personnel usually worked directly under the supervision of the banker or under the supervision of one of the banker's trusted helpers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.051" offset="7055548">Now, in this case, the petitioners Ingram and Jenkins were convicted of the offenses named in Counts 2 and 3, that is, the failure to pay the special stamp tax and the failure to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.659" offset="7109987">And, the Court of Appeals below indicated that, in that Court, petitioners Ingram and Jenkins abandoned appeal on those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.982" offset="7159306">From -- as Mr. Asinof has conceded, the record very clearly indicates that Rufus -- rather, Horace Ingram was a banker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.117" offset="7207790">There is also, we submit, evidence that Rufus, Ingram was a principal of some sort in this operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.772" offset="7250422">There was a testimony that could -- the jury could infer and find, reasonably, that Rufus Jenkins was either a pickup man and, as a pickup man, he would operate as a writer or a ribbon man, a banker laying-off bets with a Horace Ingram and receiving a commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.917" offset="7339029">There was evidence that, in 1957, Horace -- Rufus Jenkins was under surveillance by the state and the federal officers, that he was seen repeatedly at a place where it was suspected that there was lottery, numbers lottery, going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.516" offset="7433488">That he was at this location once and noticed the federal officers and took flight, that there was a chase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.768" offset="7478418">Some jump boys who were diversion boys that where, for diversionary purposes, jumped out of the car and ran.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.384" offset="7504959">There was a chase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.711" offset="7510183">After Rufus was caught, there was no lottery found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.522" offset="7529409">But, subsequently, a couple of weeks later, in talking with the officers, Rufus Jenkins admitted that, at the time when the jump -- boys jumped out of the car, they had left the bag of lottery next to him on the sit of -- of his car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.130" offset="7591894">There was testimony that Rufus Jenkins was seen at Horace Ingram's garage, which was the city headquarters for this lottery, the place where -- what was called the money headquarters where the money settlements were made to the scene at this place repeatedly, that he was seen counting money with Horace Ingram, that there is also evidence that he was referenced on bond for some of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.337" offset="7720730">There's testimony as to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.565" offset="7725641">There was also testimony that he had a -- when he had gone away for a short time, that he had turned over some automobiles that he used in his lottery business to Horace Ingram, and Horace Ingram had sold the cars and that Rufus Jenkins was upset about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.251" offset="7816338">Now, as to petitioners Smith and Law, they were only convicted of the conspiracy offense, the conspiracy to evade the excise tax and the special stamp tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="3042.157" offset="12271992">There was testimony by Clarence Walker, a drag man, a messenger, for Horace Ingram in 1954 that he took 75 to 85 sacks of lottery a day to points outside Atlanta and delivered them to Horace Ingram and Smith, and then, would later come back to the same rendezvous and pick up the ribbons and take them back to Atlanta.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.576" offset="12365720">Between 1954 and 1957, a whole series of surveillances indicated that Smith regularly met with Horace Ingram, Mary Law and, sometimes, Eugene Thomas and Mary Ingram around noon time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.759" offset="12422457">They'd gather in their cars and, by circuitous routes and evasive tactics, they'd go out into the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.791" offset="12450565">They were followed quite often, but unsuccessfully, by county and federal officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.590" offset="12473762">There was testimony that it was at noontime when the headquarters personnel would gather to go out to the check up headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.473" offset="12509288">This is due to the fact that the number is obtained from the stock market reports in New York and they would become unknown about noontime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.289" offset="12544502">That's when these people would be going out, and it was -- they were repeatedly seen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.076" offset="12563728">This group -- this is one group gathering together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.490" offset="12577311">There was testimony by Eddie Allen who worked for -- who testified that he worked for Horace Ingram in 1955, that he delivered lottery tickets to Horace Ingram, Smith, and Mary Law at places outside the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.090" offset="12631751">The meeting place, he testified, was changed once a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.475" offset="12657246">In December of 1955, another employee of Horace Ingram was apprehended driving a truck which had a secret compartment in it, and lottery tickets were found in this compartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.821" offset="12730702">While the truck -- truck was stopped, Horace -- Horace Ingram and Smith came by and were pursued but were not caught.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.621" offset="12761840">Turner informed investigator Carter that Horace Ingram would pay his bond and fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.725" offset="12786291">This was the usual arrangement that was testified for the banker to pay the bonds and fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.243" offset="12812309">When Turner pleaded guilty, Smith appeared at the courthouse, paid Turner's $1,000 fine and paid $100 attorney fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.832" offset="12850657">In December 1955, Smith bought, a -- for delivery to Horace Ingram's garage, a large quantity of ham and turkey, the name of a fictitious purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.848" offset="12898722">The payments were made by Smith and the police officers were seen carrying ham and whiskey that Christmas from Horace Ingram's garage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.135" offset="12943862">In the afternoon of September 20, 1956, Smith, Mary Law, along with Eugene Thomas, and John Ingram, were caught at the check up headquarters, out in a rural county outside of Atlanta, operating the -- a typical lottery check up headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.963" offset="13023274">Smith plead guilty to the state charge of lottery and on his bond, as a reference, there appeared the initials H.I.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.579" offset="13057651">Smith was seen regularly at the garage in the months of -- the garage there in Atlanta in the months of January, February, and March 1957 carrying, at various times, sacks and, one time, carrying out an adding machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.703" offset="13122226">And, in the March 27th raid -- the evening of March 27th, Ingram -- rather, Smith was found there at the garage and, on his person, there was found a lottery ribbon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.211" offset="13180217">Also, Smith was seen giving -- he was present with Horace Ingram when the two -- rather, when Horace Ingram was seen giving money to a policeman in January of -- January 9th, 1957.</text>

            <text syncTime="3298.782" offset="13298500">Now, as to Mary Parks Law, she also was seen, in 1954, at Horace Ingram's garage, the city headquarters for this operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.918" offset="13339042">She, was -- along with Smith, was seen regularly gathering with Horace Ingram, Smith and, sometimes, a couple of others at noontime and this group -- going out to the country, indulging in the evasive tactics to throw off the law officers who were trying to follow them and detect the check-up headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.540" offset="13429530">As I indicated before, Eddie Allen testified that he delivered tickets to her, along with Horace Ingram and Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.845" offset="13458787">She was found in the checkup headquarters in 1956 and, at time, she gave a false name.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.981" offset="13483342">She claimed that her name was Marie Ranson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.462" offset="13497240">She pleaded guilty to a state lottery charge and her bond, as under the name Marie Ranson, the false name, and the bond -- her bond for this state charge had the reference -- has, as a reference, the initials H.I.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.412" offset="13560978">Later, after the detection of this check0-up headquarters, she was again seen with Smith, going -- at noontime, going out into the outskirts of Atlanta.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.065" offset="13607581">Subsequent to the raid on the garage on March 27th, Mary Law was again picked up by John Ingram and Eugene Thomas, and there were efforts on the part of those three to go out in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.457" offset="13661184">At that time, the law officers continued to follow them even though they knew that they were -- the parties knew that they were being followed, and they didn't go anywhere at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.901" offset="13711026">That, I believe, is a summary of the evidence.</text>

            <label>Mr. Wesley R. Asinof</label>
            <text syncTime="3410.440" offset="13745089">In this case, the evidence, as outlined by the Government, still fails to show that any of these other persons had any pecuniary interest in this enterprise as a principal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.553" offset="13825546">The fact that Mary Law's having been seen on numerous occasions going out, the testimony by the same witness also shows on cross examination that on none of those occasions did he ever trail Mary Law and find that she was actually at a lottery headquarters, and the same thing holds true as to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.120" offset="13903809">They just simply said that they got together about that time and they were seen driving out in different parts of town on different days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.904" offset="13930977">There is no evidence in the case to indicate that Mary Law, at anytime, had any pecuniary interest how much he would receive, how much he would be paid, and whether or not she ever handled any money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.893" offset="13974967">Now, the Government relies pretty heavily upon the expert testimony in this case, but the expert testimony merely goes to the fact of how the lottery operates and it does not specifically show what went on in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.747" offset="14042363">And, I stated in my opening and I've stated in my brief, we've conceded that this was a large-scale lottery operation, but this Court is not concerned with the size of the operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.900" offset="14090951">This Court is not concerned with the fact that these persons violated the laws of the State of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.931" offset="14111117">This Court is concerned only with whether or not the evidence is sufficient to show that a conspiracy was entered into to evade and defeat the payment of federal tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.231" offset="14148315">And, in that connection, I want to say that, again, and reiterate to the Court that if Horace Ingram owed federal taxes and did not pay them all, if he evaded and defeated the payment of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.121" offset="14199829">But, if that was solely his idea as to the evasion and to the defeating of those federal taxes, and there's no evidence that any other person actually conspired with him to evade and defeat the payment of the tax, but that the evidence merely shows that they simply did assist him in the operation of a lottery, then the conviction against Horace Ingram on the conspiracy count should not stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.849" offset="14286764">And, likewise, the conviction as to all of the others in the case, to be allowed to stand upon the record and the evidence in this case would be actually in conflict with the Kahriger case from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.312" offset="14336606">Now, we also want to, again, reiterate that this concealment or conspiracy to conceal in this case was not a main conspiracy or was not main.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.877" offset="14378924">It was subsidiary and, being subsidiary, we -- we must consider that, along with the extension of the Grunewald and the Lutwak and the Krulewitch case, that there should be an extension of the principle in that or the doctrine of that case -- in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.315" offset="14436603">There should be an extensions so that, where it is merely a subsidiary conspiracy to conceal, then the proof of that subsidiary conspiracy to conceal should not be accepted as proof of the conspiracy itself where there is no other evidence independent of that subsidiary evidence of subsidiary conspiracy to conceal.</text>
