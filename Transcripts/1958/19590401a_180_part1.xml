            <label>Mr. Carl W. Berueffy</label>
            <text syncTime="32.018" offset="231424">This case, of course, involves the same issues in the main -- on the merits that are involved in Taylor against McElroy.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.675" offset="278026">I think the best way to examine what is at issue here is to examine first what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.570" offset="325674">And if I may put this case in chronological order, I would summarize it as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.749" offset="358379">In 1936, this petitioner, William L. Greene graduated from New York University as an aeronautical engineer, a profession which has come to be of great importance in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.169" offset="428074">He went to work for Engineering and Research Company, a private corporation and the history of his rise in that corporation which, although not a large one, is a very substantial one, is almost spectacular.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.219" offset="492231">Best summarized by saying that at 35 years of age, he became the Vice President and General Manager of that company.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.616" offset="529847">And this could indicate nothing other than his devotion to the duties of his work and to his employer and to the Government and to the military services because that company came to be engaged almost entirely in military production.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.197" offset="608110">Now, in 1942, he made a marriage with a girl to whom I shall have occasion to refer, I think, in the future, Jean Hinton without going into all of the details, could be said this was an unfortunate marriage for many reasons, and it terminated in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.867" offset="714794">All of the charges with no exception relate in the Government's statement through the period beginning in 1942 and ending in 1947 or a very trivial contact continuing over into 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.357" offset="800789">Now, while this marriage was in existence, Mr. Greene was one of the people selected by the Air Force and by industry to go to Germany to see what could be discovered by way of German war secrets and war preparation.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.306" offset="892635">He came back in 1947 or thereabouts, about the time of the termination of the marriage through the divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.650" offset="929938">The Navy and the Air Force was in great need of a device called the electronic flight simulator, a device which simulates for flight conditions for the purpose of training pilots in the handling of the planes.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.970" offset="995244">The record shows that at least two companies had failed to produce this very necessary device.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.384" offset="1028890">And so, the Navy came to ERCO and Admiral Solberg, the Chief of Naval Research at the time, testified that one of the things that brought him to ERCO was the high caliber of the engineering staff which had been assembled by Mr. Greene in that company.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.946" offset="1111124">In 14 months, Mr. Greene made this device.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.250" offset="1128364">And this is the classified information about which we will be talking exclusively in this case, that is the material that went into the making of the electric flight simulator.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.348" offset="1188760">Now, in 1949, two years after the determination of these things that the Government says no, justify throwing him out of work, the Government gave him a clearance for access to top secret information.And two years later, in 1951, there was a proceeding to revoke his clearance for access to that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.951" offset="1291160">And this went and a procedure such as -- has been -- has been described to Your Honors here occurred before an organization then known as the Industrial Employment Review Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="319.957" offset="1383215">And that was summarized by saying that he had known some Communists without naming them that he had seen some Russian diplomats that -- without naming them and that he had gone to a dinner of the Southern Conference for Human Welfare.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carl W. Berueffy</label>
            <text syncTime="357.357" offset="1532844">Although Greene never asked for other than top secret, the Government had -- other than secret, the Government had pretty consistently giving him -- given him access to top secret information.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.134" offset="1579865">Well, this went to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.089" offset="1587702">Now, the Government admits in its brief that everything that had subsequently considered was talked about in this hearing before the Industrial Employment Review Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.228" offset="1636289">I don't think that's quite accurate because I think there was one matter which cannot fairly be said to appear in that -- in that earlier hearing and that is the matter of Greene's having worked as a consultant for Mr. Laughlin Currie, a one time Presidential Assistant.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.346" offset="1720717">At any event, this Board examined all of this material and restored Greene's clearance, then he went back to work for ERCO and the Navy insist -- continued to insist that ERCO do this work as fast as possible, and this was the situation until the following year.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.727" offset="1818311">And in April of 1953, and this was six years after anything that the Government had alleged or had considered or that we ever learned about as being direct derogatory information, the Secretary of the Navy wrote a letter to ERCO.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.917" offset="1915068">And this was a very short letter and what it says is, "I have reviewed the case history of William Lewis Greene and pursuant to this contract, I direct you or I request you to exclude him from your plans and to deny him access to classified information.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.694" offset="1998137">And I think the phraseology is important because they are not, at this point, talking about denying access to classified information.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.792" offset="2030529">They are telling a private employer that he may not admit his own employee to his own plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.983" offset="2063339">Now, this letter was sent to ERCO and the Government stipulates that they never sent any letter to Greene about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.393" offset="2100955">And the -- the letter recited no reasons for a change, although at the time there was a directive from Mr. Wilson, the Secretary of Defense, saying that the Secretaries were to continue to apply the -- the criteria applied by the Industrial Employment Review Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.688" offset="2182144">Now, the next thing that happened was that Mr. Wells, the President of ERCO, wrote to the Secretary of -- of the Navy and said, "This man is very valuable to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.917" offset="2255078">Not having him is a great blow to the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.028" offset="2267512">May we come in and talk this over with you?"</text>
            <text syncTime="545.182" offset="2284126">And the answer of Mr. Anderson was, "There isn't any purpose and any further discussion of his case."</text>
            <text syncTime="555.292" offset="2324564">So Greene was out.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.080" offset="2339715">The trial judge in this case described what ERCO did as a willing compliance with the request of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.300" offset="2376600">But what ERCO actually did was to, as the record shows, hold this job open for Greene for over a year, hoping that he could get clearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.638" offset="2421948">This is still in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.256" offset="2444413">They wrote Greene saying, "Please, get it cleared up.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.347" offset="2460714">If there is anything ERCO can do to help you by way of evidence, let us know."</text>
            <text syncTime="595.916" offset="2487045">And Mr. Berliner, Colonel Berliner, the Chairman of the Board, the principle stockholder of ERCO, made an affidavit that he would -- there was no reason for Greene's discharge except their letter that they received from the Secretary of the Navy.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.074" offset="2575653">He also, at -- in the testimony before the hearing which subsequently occurred, he testified that he would stake his entire company on Mr. Greene's judgment as to the -- his ability to build this flight simulator.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.640" offset="2665932">I think there are few employees who have received a more convincing demonstration of their employer's confidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.916" offset="2715042">After a great deal of effort, the Secretary of the Navy, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy in response to a request -- to a demand, requested the Eastern Industrial Personnel Security Board, which had, by this time, been set up to review his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.045" offset="2811591">And at -- this was in September, but there was no hearing until the following late April or early May.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.838" offset="2850774">This is in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.560" offset="2865612">During that intervening time, we made an effort to find out what this case was about and finally, the Board sent a series of 13 charges which are in the record and which, for the most part, relate to matters concerning Jean Hinton Greene, the girl to whom he had previously been married and probably at this time, he had been divorced for seven years.</text>

            <text syncTime="911.513" offset="3749386">Question, "Did you ever hear her said that Jean slept on a board in order to keep the common touch?"</text>
            <text syncTime="919.561" offset="3781569">Answer, "That's a new one on me but everybody I've ever known who had any disturbance with their spinal column had to sleep on a board."</text>
            <text syncTime="933.209" offset="3836217">Now, this is a wild idea, no doubt and if I were a mattress [Laughter] -- if I were a mattress manufacturer, I -- I might be regard this is subversive.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.583" offset="3877700">[Laughter] But the point is, is this material to defend -- to deprive the Government and the military of the services of a man who have -- who has served it well, extremely well, testified to not by Greene and his friends, but throughout this record to -- by military officials concerned with the problem of getting this material.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.799" offset="3986578">Now, coming to the issues, as I see them in this case, we are first met with the problem of what is it the Government did?</text>
            <text syncTime="987.235" offset="4052302">The Government says, "We merely denied this man access, and any damage was consequential."</text>
            <text syncTime="995.234" offset="4084276">But in their brief, they admit in the face of what they cannot practically deny that to a man in the profession of aeronautical engineering, the denial of clearance is -- is the equivalent practically of denying him a right to work at his profession because there is no significant aircraft manufacturer who can employ an aeronautical engineer who does not have clearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.452" offset="4225128">It's simply can't be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.018" offset="4235473">The Government admits this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.335" offset="4244668">But they say, "We have control of the classified information of the Government -- that belongs to the Government."</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.842" offset="4286777">But the Government does not limit its claim of employment to the control of classified information for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.134" offset="4331917">First, as we show in our brief, you cannot be an officer of a corporation without clearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.786" offset="4362533">And as the Vice President and General Manager of ERCO, Greene was, of course, a corporation officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.659" offset="4390013">And there are, I suggest, many officers of a corporation who do not need access to classified information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.116" offset="4423868">And as the Solicitor General said yesterday, this isn't -- in any case, this is not free access to all the secrets of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.354" offset="4464828">This is access to that information which you need to perform your duties on the contracts that your employer is doing for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.389" offset="4512893">That's all it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.054" offset="4519581">You could have access to top secret or super top secret or any other classification, but if you didn't require that information in your job, you couldn't get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.888" offset="4562944">So, the Government is controlling or attempting to control the officers of corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.230" offset="4592306">Furthermore, and this case demonstrates, the Government is not limiting its control to ownership -- to -- to material of which it really has ownership because the executive order which is put -- which is stated in -- in its text in -- as an appendix to our brief says that whether or not you produce this -- this information, if the Government classified it, you may not have access without clearance, that is it's subject to control under that executive order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.572" offset="4793657">So, here, you get some information that the Government had, but it isn't valuable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.316" offset="4824586">It is invaluable until a man, like Greene, makes the engineering flow that turns it into something that's useful, and it isn't valuable I suggest until a man, like Taylor turns it out on the lays in a -- in the form of a useful thing and this is what the Government is controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.289" offset="4916537">Now, this is what the Government says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.291" offset="4936495">They -- they have a right to control and let me suggest, if I may, that the way the Secretary of the Navy handled this case indicates exactly what the Government does claim and what the Government repeats in its brief, I suggest, in this Court which is that this is an absolute power, that it is unrestrained, that nobody can question and because those are relatively strong statements, I -- I think I should read from page 43 of the Government's brief in the Greene case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.898" offset="5110993">Down towards the bottom, "That the executive may ultimately act in this area on mere doubts or simply a lack of complete confidence."</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.511" offset="5173373">And on page 44, "Action which may, if necessary, be based on no more than doubt and which is, in itself, not judicially reviewable."</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.751" offset="5230425">And then finally quoting with a probo from Von Knorr against Miles, "The Government would remain free to disregard the testimony and rely on its uncorroborated suspicions and its uncorroborated suspicions," as the Government says elsewhere in its brief, "may be fully consistent with the likelihood that this man is in fact both loyal and discreet."</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.601" offset="5373785">Now, this, I'm -- I would like to say as a slanting reply to what Mr. -- what the Solicitor General has said, this is a claim of absolute authority, of unlimited authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.496" offset="5441390">And it is in square conflict, I submit, with the statement of this Court in -- in Wieman against Updegraff that you cannot exclude even from the exercise of what used to be denominated a privilege on the basis -- on a basis which is patently arbitrary or discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.399" offset="5549014">And this Court has many times said that government officials may not act in an arbitrary fashion, may not draw irrational or dogmatic inferences from facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.224" offset="5640234">Now, I think, unless you are going to be -- to accept what is a clear transparency, the Government is claiming to exercise an unlimited control over the employment and the livelihood and the very lives of what is today approximately 3 million employees in private industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.567" offset="5761651">I -- I think that it is impossible to determine this kind of a case without facing the realities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.896" offset="5798954">And the reality is that this is an exercise of control on an unrestrained and unlimited basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1476.226" offset="6008247">That is the theory that was advanced by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.044" offset="6031548">And that brings us, I think, to the question of -- of where does this power come from?</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.630" offset="6057880">In a government where we've got a Due Process Clause, the very essence of which is protection against arbitrary governmental action as this Court said in Slochower.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.771" offset="6118484">What is this kind of a power that's unlimited control?</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.346" offset="6128724">Where does it come from?</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.012" offset="6135411">Government says it comes from an inherent executive power, an inherent executive power which the -- the -- which the executive had always had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.012" offset="6191417">Now, I think there might be an -- I think there might be an inherent power to do some things, but I think you have to go a long way to spell out an executive -- an inherent executive power thus to interfere what the private employment and private livelihood of a citizen of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.097" offset="6287757">And I don't think we need to be concerned about, although I -- I'm sure that Greene's right to private employment is a constitutionally protected right which I cannot believe to be less important than the right to travel or -- or any of the things that this Court has given protection for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.254" offset="6384410">But even if the -- what the Government was -- says is true, that this is only an exercise of the privilege, the -- the Government can give or take as it chooses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.566" offset="6441671">I think what Wieman, what -- what Slochower and what -- and what these other cases have said is that even so the Government can't do this on an arbitrary basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.451" offset="6497155">Now, yesterday, the -- the Solicitor General conceded, I thought, that you couldn't do it on the arbitrary basis of -- of taking one out of every three.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.085" offset="6547728">Now, since -- since we are in the process of defining future conduct, and that is what we are doing realistically, Greene never did anything and there isn't anything in these charges.</text>

            <text syncTime="1727.627" offset="7013857">Then four of them were people that Greene had met in the course of this business of attempting to sell the worked propeller.</text>

            <text syncTime="1753.084" offset="7115734">Now, this -- of course, I'm not asking the -- the Court to -- to review this record and make fact findings, but I am saying that the Solicitor General has said -- conceded, I think, that we must have some kind of a rational basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.610" offset="7225762">I think in answer to Mr. Justice Harlan's question, he indicated that he didn't think this could be completely arbitrary, although that's the way the -- the Secretary maybe acted, as I pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.931" offset="7287097">Now, as I say, you are trying to define or to divine some things which were not illegal, which were not immoral, which in the case of trying to sell goods to the Russians in the early 1940s was not even unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.605" offset="7369749">You're trying to -- to divine a future conduct which can't be equated to anything expect the possibility that this man will commit treason against the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1851.026" offset="7507466">I suggest that there are other procedures of divination which people in the past have used that -- for instance, lot casting or say putting all the names in the hat and pulling out 10 or 1000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.747" offset="7586356">Others have -- have tried to divine the future by looking at the entrails of a freshly slain animal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.771" offset="7626480">But even in the days of the Romans, they didn't try to define future on the basis of information from anonymous hidden formats.</text>

            <text syncTime="1894.349" offset="7680815">Now, if there has to be some process, I submit, it has to be due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1906.414" offset="7728985">In Taylor, Mr. Rauh talked about the problem of confrontation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.870" offset="7754898">The problem of due process in Greene is much broader than confrontation because, as I understand it, any kind of a process would require some kind of notice, some kind of hearing, some kind of effective opportunity to defendants or one's self.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.762" offset="7842461">In this case, the Government stipulated that we didn't have notice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1946.316" offset="7888645">And I would like to read that particular paragraph to you.</text>

            <text syncTime="2565.589" offset="10365680">To our great traditions of individual liberty of the value of the human person, human spirits requiring fundamental fairness in our normal procedures, to those principles require a trial type due process hearing when the Government is determining whether it will deny access to government secrets in that limited restricted area, is there any exception to their basic principles and their application of due process?</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.930" offset="10551045">Now, a -- a more precise constitutional test would be has the Government limited the constitutional liberties of the citizen in this case to any greater extent than is reasonably necessary and proper under all the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.667" offset="10630040">Now, if we have, this procedure is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.765" offset="10646444">But in answer, it does require, may I submit, the most careful and full and comprehensive evaluation of the problem upon a realistic basis and all the factors that are involved in the equation not just one and you've only heard one so far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.110" offset="10719796">You remember you have said due process takes into account the nature of the problem and it is not a mechanical instrument or yardstick.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.006" offset="10755427">Now, the first factor in the equation is our great traditions of liberty and freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.882" offset="10782908">Now, the second is this, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter said in the Anti-Fascist Committee case, “We recognize its summary administrative procedure may be sanctioned by history or obvious necessity.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.807" offset="10854588">Now, the United States is the only government in the world that accords any hearing at all in connection with access to government secrets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.529" offset="10905475">Now, this program did not evolve during some temporary period of hysteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.153" offset="10939956">It has perhaps existed three or four years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.896" offset="10955003">It originated in the beginning of 1942 during the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.594" offset="10977782">And it was operated then upon a completely informal basis, as is being done in Great Britain and each of the NATO countries, the Defense Department informs me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.676" offset="11046118">The United States would -- would decide that it lacked confidence in someone working in a defense plant, and it would notify the company that it didn't trust such, such, such and such a man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.515" offset="11129396">The company would move him to a non-sensitive position, if it had one, if it could, or it would dismiss him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.482" offset="11165341">And as a matter of fact, the Report of the Commission on Government's Security states that 2000 industrial employees were dismissed during the war as a result of that informal procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.960" offset="11235244">Now, then, efforts were made to formalize and this formalized proceeding which was designed not to operate on such an informal basis but to accord hearing privileges or rights, these hearings, limited hearings, they are limited hearings, of course, I think, started in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.843" offset="11358751">But in any event, this program in one form or another has been in effect for 17 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.514" offset="11393442">Now, there is a confusion about the nature of the -- of the issue in these hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.202" offset="11420191">And I might say, as I said before, that Canada, Australia, Great Britain, France, countries that had -- know something about traditions of freedom, have continued to operate on the informal basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.207" offset="11492185">Now, I would like to put the problem in the terms that the Prime Minister of Canada recently put in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.644" offset="11553938">He said -- he said to the parliament this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.288" offset="11584554">First, he said employer should always try to avoid dismissals if it all possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.757" offset="11614438">They have a duty not to increase the difficulties or disabilities of persons whose only misfortune is that their liability is open to question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.035" offset="11659473">And I might say here that there was no directive to this employer to dismiss Mr. Greene.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.440" offset="11697089">And I emphasize that because no one in the defense establishment had any authority to tell an employer to dismiss anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.073" offset="11743692">And it would have been exceeding authority to have done s.And as a matter of fact, the regulations and policy of the Department, Defense Department made clear that it's their hope that employers will transfer someone who isn't cleared for access to secret information, a classified information to a non-sensitive position.On the other hand, I must conceive --</text>
