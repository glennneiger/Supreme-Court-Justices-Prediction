            <label>Mr. James B. Donovan</label>
            <text syncTime="27.074" offset="211675">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.667" offset="242082">This case is before the Court on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.861" offset="274787">The writ was granted by this Court with respect to two specific questions which are, (1) whether the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution is violated by a search and a the seizure of evidence without a search warrant, after an alien suspected and officially accused of espionage has been taken into custody for deportation pursuant to an Administrative Immigration Service warrant, but has not been arrested for the commission of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.858" offset="418774">And (2), whether the Fourth and Fifth Amendments are violated when articles so seized are unrelated to the deportation warrant and together with other articles obtained from such leads, are introduced as evidence in a prosecution for espionage.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.269" offset="504456">The petitioner, Abel, was indicted on August 7th, 1957 on a three-count indictment in the Eastern District of New York, charging, in summary, the capital crime of conspiring to commit espionage on behalf of Soviet Russia.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.203" offset="596198">Abel is a Russian national.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.887" offset="610931">After a jury trial, he was convicted and sentenced to thirty years in prison, a term that he's now serving in the federal prison in Atlanta.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.985" offset="659310">The conviction, thereafter, was unanimously affirmed by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.920" offset="691075">It will be my contention today that the Fourth and the Fifth Amendments were violated in this case under the circumstances which are set forth by the introduction in -- to evidence, in this case, of various materials that had been seized pursuant to this administrative immigration warrant and unsupported by any search warrant or normal warrant of arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.542" offset="817507">The facts in this case are substantially undisputed although there are disputes with respect to the conclusions, both legal and factual, which that should be drawn from those and their various inferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.103" offset="883754">In early May 1957, one, Reino Hayhanen, entered the American Embassy in Paris and stated that since 1952, he had been serving as a Lieutenant Colonel in Russian secret intelligence in the United States performing espionage duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.600" offset="989811">He told about the fact that in the United States, he reported to, as the so-called, "resident agent," a man named, "Mark," whom he did not further identified, but who he stated was a Colonel in Russian military intelligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.385" offset="1088867">He also stated that this man, while living about in the various cheap hotels in New York City, maintained an art studio in Brooklyn which was employed as a cover.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.607" offset="1149785">Hayhanen was returned to the United States and his story was promptly and very thoroughly investigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.124" offset="1183848">He took the F.B.I. to his home in Peekskill, New York, where various materials, all tending to connect him with espionage and to give credence to his story were uncovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.474" offset="1249259">He furthermore, with respect to his statements concerning, Mark, subsequently identified as the petitioner here, Abel, the F.B.I. at the same time they were investigating for corroboration of Hayhanen's story, they also began to shadow Abel.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.943" offset="1343195">They watched the studio.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.442" offset="1349151">They found out that there was such a man.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.133" offset="1359914">That he did maintain an art studio and that meanwhile he was not living there.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.062" offset="1387604">Annexed to our brief, as Appendix B, the Court will find a compilation of all of the various materials that were in the possession of the Department of Justice and could constitute evidence of espionage prior to the detention for deportation of Abel which occurred on June 21st.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.383" offset="1504946">It accordingly, would be our contention and not simply that there was probable cause prior to this apprehension I'll describe, not simply that there was probable cause to believe that -- that the man occupying the art studio and as it turned out also room 839 in the Hotel Latham, had committed espionage, but the evidence was rather clear and convincing unless controverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.416" offset="1637021">This, of course, is important in our judgment because of the fact that it is germane to the issue here, that such probable cause to believe that this man had committed the capital crime of espionage did exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.949" offset="1715179">In fact, if the Court would turn to the affidavit that was submitted by government attorney, Maroney, in the District Court, the Court will find that -- that he very well summarizes this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.094" offset="1795741">It's on page 57 of the joint appendix, and it will show that the conclusion reached by the Department of Justice at that time, the Internal Security Division, was that because Hayhanen said, he, while he would tell the story, must refuse to testify publicly for fear of implicating his family in Russia, that they believe that they could not successfully prosecute for espionage at that time, lacking the testimony of Hayhanen in open court.</text>

            <text syncTime="472.685" offset="1994062">Furthermore, as, Your Honor, knows these warrants can be sealed and indeed, one was in this case, so that for a -- a period of time this -- this could be kept confidential.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.006" offset="2043382">But this is not set forth either in the District Court or in the Government's brief in this Court as determined to the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.990" offset="2079326">Mr. Maroney explains that they believe that because he wouldn't testify that they would not be able to successfully prosecute.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.592" offset="2117778">Now, under the Brinegar case, and the very recent Draper case, unreported before the Court, we say that this question is quite irrelevant with respect to whether or not there was probable cause to obtain a search warrant, that there's just no question, but that we believe such a search warrant could have been obtained on affidavits by the F.B.I. agents as to what they had been informed and corroborated by this massive evidence which is set forth in -- in Exhibit B to our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="586.702" offset="2450160">Needless to say, than I would be, but I can't point out to Your Honor that in this specific case, a warrant -- a search warrant, was obtained as the docket in the case and the very front of our transcript will show.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.403" offset="2517034">A search warrant was obtained on June 28th , based upon affidavits by an F.B.I. agent and an I.N.S. agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.148" offset="2563950">And it was not until after the man was indicted that there was any public disclosure of this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.028" offset="2595506">It was the first public knowledge of it and Your Honor will find an entry in the docket at the very commencement of this transcript of August 7th by (Inaudible) order for sealing of search warrant and by (Inaudible) order for opening of search warrant, affidavits and exhibits file.</text>

            <text syncTime="697.397" offset="2892988">Your Honor, will find that there's a recital in here about the fact of how on June 21st, Goldfus was taken into custody and the investigation was made, what was seized and so on and therefore, they asked for a search warrant to search the art studio in Brooklyn having completed this search of the hotel room which is the specific search before this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="799.859" offset="3302797">Well, Your Honor, I respectfully submit that under the Brinegar case and under the -- under this latest Draper case, but as a matter of -- of law long before either of those cases, that based upon everything that was available, everything that was available set forth in Exhibit D in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.958" offset="3383254">And based upon what the F.B.I. agents could recite as to what they had been informed by this man that there'd be no question that they could -- that there was probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.564" offset="3429648">Any reasonable person would have said that -- that the -- that there was brave reason to believe that the -- the man had committed espionage.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.053" offset="3463607">I -- I think, Your Honor, will find that on analysis of the -- the affidavits that had been submitted that it -- a fairest summary of what was involved was that -- that on this particular thing that they believed that they'd unsuccessfully prosecute.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.648" offset="3553991">Now, I wouldn't necessarily even agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.859" offset="3566843">But while they do say that the available evidence was insufficient to secure a warranted complaint, all that I could say, Your Honor, is, I think, that they misconceive the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.377" offset="3604877">And I think that the Brinegar case and the Draper case make that perfectly evident.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.416" offset="3629014">If the Draper case could be upheld in this case where it isn't simply a question of hearsay or anything else of that kind, but every element which led Justice Black to dissent in the Draper case is clearly evident here.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.581" offset="3701739">Every -- every bit of the story that had been given to the F.B.I. was corroborated by this massive material set forth on pages 38 to 42 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.153" offset="3751999">In other words -- in other words, Your Honor, before they ever searched Abel's room, apprehended him, or anything else, we're talking about the fact that Hayhanen, to corroborate his story, had turned over to them such items as microfilm messages, radio-receiving headsets, hollowed-out coins to contain microfilm messages and a wide variety of other things which a normal person would conclude, would be espionage materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.371" offset="3900897">Now, having reached the conclusion then, that they should act otherwise and, of course, in our brief, we explained why we believe they chose this cause of action, I should like to read what the Department of Justice decided and this is exceedingly important.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.646" offset="4017925">Indeed, the -- the crux of this case, in a great many ways, because for one specific reason, it completely knocks out in my judgement the -- the so-called findings made by the courts below, simply because of a misconception.</text>

            <text syncTime="1004.061" offset="4119594">You -- Your Honor will find that the Circuit Court opinion and indeed the District Court opinion, but the Circuit Court opinion at much great length, dwells on the fact that the I.N.S. officers employed for a specific purpose, I'll explain in a minute, deserves special papers that they, in good faith, other words, this is an argument which go around the Harris case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.634" offset="4225860">That they, in good faith, were performing the unlimited I.N.S. functions with blind desire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.743" offset="4254386">The F.B.I., so too, in good faith, they were performing their specific functions with blindness on those specific limited functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.044" offset="4303600">But the whole point, Your Honor, and may I add then to carry that further, both courts below that it conclude that there's no reason why each one of these services, each bearing in mind this specific jurisdictional function, there was no reason they should not cooperate together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.471" offset="4373295">Now, the misconception that I'm explaining is that this completely overlooks the fact that both of those services are simply component parts of the Department of Justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1152.550" offset="4713618">Your Honors will know -- note that in the bottom of page 56, Mr. Maroney stated in May of 1957 information reflecting possible espionage activity on the part of Abel, known then only by the cryptonym, Mark, was first brought to the attention of the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.312" offset="4792613">The Federal Bureau of Investigation immediately conducted an intensive investigation of Abel and his alleged espionage activities and the results, thereof, were furnished to the Internal Security Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.856" offset="4842768">He then goes on -- and as I say, explained -- that they believe that they didn't have enough evidence to get a warrant, to get an indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.966" offset="4875264">And again, as I say, insofar as having enough evidence to obtain a warrant, I say that both the Brinegar case and the Draper case ran to any of such concept of misconception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.579" offset="4933674">And then I point out to Your Honor that down on the bottom of page 57, this is very well summarized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.678" offset="4966066">Thus, on June 19th, 1957, the Department of Justice had information that a Soviet national was in the United States illegally and was heading up a Soviet espionage apparatus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.432" offset="5025102">The Department was unable to proceed under the espionage statutes, but could proceed under the immigration laws, the duty and obligation to do so seems to us clear.</text>

            <text syncTime="1589.020" offset="6459434">Then when that failed, then have the F.B.I. call in I.N.S. officers waiting outside the hall, have them serve him with this warrant, grab everything, hustle them off in the plane to a remote place in -- in Texas and hold them incommunicado for three days.</text>

            <text syncTime="1973.843" offset="7998777">Let us not think that in talking of the two roads that I have, (1) of going down this road of no public return, keeping it entirely secret, using administrative warrant, that the only other road, the road of due process was to indict for espionage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.133" offset="8067950">It's a crime to illegally enter the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2761.381" offset="11148936">It's -- the first one is called a warrant for the arrest of an alien and there's a statute authorizing this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.805" offset="11178611">Briefly, it lacks every characteristic traditionally associated with an arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2812.822" offset="11354676">Number four, and perhaps most important, Your Honors will note, there's no requirement that this be issued even based on any one's affidavit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3570.212" offset="14384253">So at that point, it was a question of what could be done, and I contend on behalf of the Government, without any hesitation that they didn't have to sit back and say, “Here's the man as he'd been in this country illegally for nine years, we can't get him on the charge of espionage because of this defector's unwillingness to testify.</text>

            <text syncTime="3607.788" offset="14534510">Now, their testimony is -- is this is the man's own testimony in this case at McAllen, Texas that he was in this country illegally, he was a citizen of Soviet Russia, he gave his name and that he came illegally through the Canadian border at an unknown point.So all of the elements for deportation were proved by his own statements within three days after the date he was taken down.</text>

            <text syncTime="3783.901" offset="15238980">And at that time, these men, when they went to New York, were instructed to see the acting director of the immigration service there and to -- to check with the F.B.I. in New York before serving this -- as to the identity and locating the man.</text>
