            <text syncTime="74.638" offset="401951">The answer, of course, is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.482" offset="417311">In this case, however, as I will demonstrate, the facts were that there was one key witness.</text>

            <text syncTime="178.015" offset="815417">But, as I pointed out here, 10 defendants requested the grand jury testimony only of Jonas, although there were numerous other Government witnesses who testified before the grand jury and who testified at trial, and no request was made for their testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="260.971" offset="1147277">That is not contended.</text>

            <label>Mr. H. Graham Morison</label>
            <text syncTime="277.078" offset="1211643">Now, it is our contention, if it please the Court, that you cannot understand the sinuous of fundamentals in this case unless you look at the facts as it pertains to my client.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.260" offset="1280397">John Messer, a man of advanced years, a man of very positive and determinative personality who had been a vigorous price competitor, who completely controlled the price policies of his company, went to the Asheville meeting which was with the Mirror Manufacturer's Association and, quite in character, as we reveal from the testimony of others, I'll tell you later why John Messer didn't testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.415" offset="1417070">He announced to two members of the industry, "I, in view of the critical shortage of plate glass and the increased demand for mirrors, I'm going to raise my price."</text>
            <text syncTime="339.508" offset="1461373">He didn't say, "I want to raise it."</text>
            <text syncTime="341.385" offset="1468897">But, "I'm going to raise it."</text>
            <text syncTime="343.673" offset="1478092">And, quite understandably, from this man, that set off quite a discussion among the members of the industry at that meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.992" offset="1511320">Subsequently, a man named Kenneth Hearn called Jonas who was not present at the Asheville meeting and told him what Messer had said.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.783" offset="1554474">And, we get the first evidence advice of bias of the witness Jonas on his reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.522" offset="1577462">The testimony is when he heard that on the telephone he said, "I wouldn't believe John Messer on anything."</text>
            <text syncTime="375.925" offset="1607032">The second evidence of bias is the witness is -- comes from the witness Buchan who said, "Jonas was bitter towards Messer because of the price war."</text>
            <text syncTime="389.268" offset="1660426">But the most dramatic evidence of this witness' bias against my man Messer occurred at the critical meeting at The Bluffs where Jonas precipitated a fight, a verbal duel with Messer that was so intense, one witness said, "I thought they were going to come to blows."</text>
            <text syncTime="410.518" offset="1745481">And, the second witness, that, "I thought Messer was going to have a stroke."</text>
            <text syncTime="418.169" offset="1776097">Now, what is the testimony?</text>
            <text syncTime="423.897" offset="1798980">Keep in mind this meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.117" offset="1803891">There were only four people that are important that attended that meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.842" offset="1822699">One was John Messer, the other was Grady Stroupe of Stroupe Mirror, the third was Ralph Buchan of Carolina Mirror, and the fourth was Messer.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.634" offset="1869928">Now, two of the witnesses, Buchan and Stroupe, are in agreement on what occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.936" offset="1899081">Here's what they said, in essence.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.607" offset="1909844">They said, first, that when the meeting opened, Messer restated what he'd said at Ashville to one and all, "I'm going to raise my price to 78, an increase of about 10%."</text>
            <text syncTime="462.918" offset="1955088">At that point, Jonas jumped on it and, in effect, doubted his veracity.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.425" offset="1981106">And, this terrible, as they described it in the record, hassle between the two men occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.837" offset="2010676">Then, after that had subsided, there was a discussion of the price situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.460" offset="2041187">And next, finally, when Messer, still thoroughly mad, he said, "All right, you're going to all have to get out a letter on the same day," and what happened then?</text>
            <text syncTime="496.131" offset="2087894">Both Buchan and Stroupe said as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.932" offset="2103150">Stroupe said, "I didn't come here for that purpose and I won't do it."</text>
            <text syncTime="505.302" offset="2124570">Buchan said, "I am not authorized to make any sort of an arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.192" offset="2140139">I'm here only as an observer."</text>
            <text syncTime="511.018" offset="2147453">He was a subordinate of Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.825" offset="2154663">He was sent there by Ed Gardner, the President of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.413" offset="2173053">And, they both agree that, in -- at that posture of the events at The Bluff, Messer said, "You can all go to hell.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.511" offset="2213386">I'm going to 78 and the rest of you can do what you want."</text>
            <text syncTime="533.222" offset="2236270">Now, the testimony is that Buchan reported that last and significant fact to his superior, Gardner.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.445" offset="2281200">And, Gardner had to deal with that and evaluate it as to what he would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.474" offset="2305233">It's significant that neither Buchan nor Stroupe testified that there was an agreement, but Jonas did.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.519" offset="2345462">Now, I want to talk about John Messer again.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.471" offset="2361240">You've got to understand that -- I believe the Court have got to understand this man.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.809" offset="2386631">John Messer was a man of advanced years, I have stated he was a very positive and assertive man, a tough, vigorous price competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.951" offset="2427173">He was examined extensively by Dr. David C. Wilson of the University of Virginia Hospital, a specialist of neurology and psychiatry.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.295" offset="2464580">Dr. Wilson testified that Messer had advanced arteriosclerosis, hardening of the arteries in -- particularly in the brain, that he'd suffered several minor strokes, and that he'd suffered, as is usual in the -- such cases, a profound loss of memory, and that his recollection of the events -- critical events in this case at Ashville and at The Bluffs were vague and unreliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.936" offset="2579101">Now, obviously, he was not put on the stand, and I don't think I take liberties with the record, if I suggest to this Court, that he was of no help to his counsel in giving us the elemental facts of what occurred in Ashville and at The Bluffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.461" offset="2649213">That had to come from his competitors, including this man, Jonas.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.610" offset="2677844">Now, certainly, I think it is abundantly clear, this man Jonas, described by the Government as a principal and key witness, he was.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.783" offset="2726536">His bias towards Messer, I have just described, stands out in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.545" offset="2753599">This man Jonas, I said, decimated our man.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.667" offset="2770004">He did.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.903" offset="2775019">He glibly supplied every missing detail from the meeting at The Bluffs necessary to support the Government's case against Messer.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.388" offset="2812949">Now, let me tell you how he did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.989" offset="2831339">He -- Jonas testified Messer didn't say, "I'm going to raise my price."</text>
            <text syncTime="687.405" offset="2852968">He said, "I want to raise it."</text>
            <text syncTime="690.655" offset="2866030">When Jonas testified that when he got the assurance of the others that he agreed that he had raised his price, he said, "We just agreed that 78 was about fair and we went along," that they let Messer dictate, sending out a letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.703" offset="2942203">And, he significantly did not remember that, at the end of the meeting, this peppery language of Messer saying, "You can all go to hell.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.477" offset="2989328">I'm going to 78 and the rest of you do what you want to."</text>
            <text syncTime="724.486" offset="3001344">He didn't remember that.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.451" offset="3013151">Now, Buchan testified that he recalled no arrangements made at that meeting at The Bluffs for calling other participants, the other mirror companies not represented, but Jonas did.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.272" offset="3064456">He tied it all together.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.713" offset="3086190">Now, I want to talk about -- I'm talking again about the critical effect of Jonas, this one man, this one witness, on the defense, and to show you the posture in which we find Jonas.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.729" offset="3146271">Neither Jonas, his company, the Lenoir Mirror Company, nor another mirror company, a co-defendant not named as a defendant, the Slane Company which owned the big interest in his company, were indicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.659" offset="3206040">Suspect one, second in our dilemma of defense when we sought to interview Jonas, Government counsel instructed him not to talk to Defense counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.051" offset="3263613">And, third, the record shows Jonas testified not once, as most of the others did, but three times before the grand jury and was interviewed extensively by Government counsel, each and every time.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.956" offset="3323173">Now, keep in mind, there were no signed statements that Jonas had given to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.813" offset="3354624">The Jencks statute discovery that was exceeded to us were notes and memorandums of Government counsel preparing for trial to examine Jonas.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.106" offset="3403839">We knew that the only way in which you could attack the credibility of this key witness who would lie in that grand jury testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.146" offset="3452008">And, it's not enough to say you could have cross-examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.521" offset="3461413">Every trial lawyer knows that when you get a sense and instinct, don't do it if you don't have the foundation and let him, before the jury, say, "I've told the truth before the grand jury and I've told it here."</text>
            <text syncTime="854.182" offset="3520136">And, at that point, 10 defendants, each for different reasons, sought from the trial judge the testimony of Jonas who stated that his testimony before the grand jury covered the same batter as he testified to at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.080" offset="3583666">And, the Court -- the District Court summarily denied it because he said, "You've got to make a showing of prior inconsistency before I'll even listen to it."</text>
            <text syncTime="882.693" offset="3634134">Now, here was Jonas, the critical witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.730" offset="3658271">Certainly, in the phrase of this Court, it was one of particularized need that we were faced with."</text>
            <text syncTime="894.700" offset="3682200">And, the only policy against exceeding to the disclosure we sought is the traditional one of secrecy.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.543" offset="3709576">Now, we believe, if it please the Court, that the philosophy expressed in Jencks and in the Andolscheck case in the Second Circuit by Judge Hand is the correct philosophy that should have been applicable under these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.925" offset="3779062">We interpret that philosophy to be that fullest access to documents and material reasonably necessary for defense be given in a case of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.945" offset="3831202">We believe that it is an -- a philosophy of evenhanded justice and a fair play in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.391" offset="3860982">But we point out that if the public interest requires that such a strict rule of secrecy of -- be cloaked around the grand jury, then we say that the Government should not be permitted to use a witness who made such damaging inroads upon our defense and then to deny us the means of impeaching that witness.</text>

            <text syncTime="1374.720" offset="5602304">Well, our answer is, of course, we do believe that he has discretion and that it must be exercised at all times of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.874" offset="5630830">But, I affirm -- our view, again, that we believe, here, that the trial judge in denying access based upon the standard which the Government concedes is wrong of requiring prior inconsistencies was not exercising his discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1557.895" offset="6334986">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.622" offset="6345853">I think that if there are two points that standout very clearly from this record, they are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.663" offset="6378036">First, that though Jonas was an important witness for the Government, the Government had a case without him, that the Government's case, based upon the testimony of employees of defendant corporations was enough to go to the jury entirely without Jonas, that the testimony of these witnesses, hostile to the Government, substantially corroborated Jonas' testimony on every point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.791" offset="6518575">Second, the second observation as to the facts in the record which I think should be made here is that the arguments as to the need for just Jonas' testimony that he was a key witness, he devastated the defense, that he hadn't been indicted himself, that he was suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.845" offset="6626722">All these arguments which are really addressed to the discretion of the Court in determining whether or not inspection or production should be made, those arguments were not made in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.306" offset="6684609">That issue was not tendered to Judge Paul.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.646" offset="6697984">It was not argued to Judge Paul that there was something special about Jonas that required that his grand jury testimony be presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.217" offset="6732257">Now, let me document these general assertions that I've made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.879" offset="6750856">First, as to Jonas' testimony being substantially corroborated, my first reference shall be to the Court of Appeals opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.586" offset="6793697">The record at page 854, Judge Sobeloff, dealing with the argument that the trial court should have given an instruction as to Jonas' testimony being received with caution in view of the fact that he was an accomplice or conspirator, in the middle of the page, record 854, Judge Sobeloff says, "Moreover, Jonas' testimony was, in many respects, corroborated by other witnesses."</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.789" offset="6914487">That statement does not go as far as some of the statements made by Judge Paul who heard the testimony and presided over this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.828" offset="6950640">I should like to refer, first, to page 414 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.564" offset="7001631">There, in the colloquy between the Court and defense counsel, defense counsel asked Judge Paul to give this instruction to the jury that the uncorroborated statement of a -- of a -- of a conspirator isn't enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.680" offset="7070072">The Court, this is about a-third of the page down, "There are uncorroborated statements by every witness in here as to certain things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.437" offset="7113122">There is certainly corroboration for involving all these parties in this conspiracy without the testimony of Mr. Jonas."</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.213" offset="7148231">I asked the Court, too, to turn to page 422 at the bottom of the page, which is a continuation of the same colloquy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.175" offset="7196087">Here, they're referring to the testimony of Jonas as an accomplice and they wanted special instruction as to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.419" offset="7233076">At the bottom of the page, Judge Paul says, "In this case, the testimony of Mr. Jonas is not only not uncorroborated, but it is strongly corroborated by the officials, or at least the employees of the defendant companies themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.486" offset="7297337">Further than that, there is no denial whatever of Mr. Justice as to Jonas' testimony so far as I can recollect."</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.895" offset="7326908">Then, over in the next page, there's a discussion of as to -- between Pittsburgh's counsel as to these -- the inconsistency as -- between Jonas' testimony as to these telephone calls to Mr. Prichard in Pittsburgh.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.735" offset="7390333">And, the Court says, "That's the only instance I can recollect in which his testimony was denied," and he thinks that's completely out of the case because Mr. Gordon who is the individual official of Pittsburgh who was tried here, Judge Paul has directed his acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.626" offset="7465880">Judge Paul thought that inconsistency was out of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.753" offset="7482389">Now, that's page 422, if I may impose on the Court still further, page 471, these are the actual instructions to the jury given by Judge Paul and he's referring to Jonas' testimony there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.081" offset="7555741">And at the bottom of the page 471, he says, "I am --," you see, it's referring to the attacks that were made on Jonas' testimony during the closing arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.186" offset="7592103">He says, "I am frank to say, I did not see anything in Mr. Jonas' testimony that was any worse or as bad as what Mr. Messer's own counsel said about him in the opening statement when he said that he had the reputation of being a price-cutter and a double-crosser."</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.521" offset="7645497">And, I think it is not improper to say that Mr. Jonas' testimony is in no way denied in any substantial particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.183" offset="7680084">I'm not vouching for his testimony nor am I a part as to Mr. Jonas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.051" offset="7695548">He says the attack on him was about justification of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.475" offset="7709236">In the second paragraph there, he says his testimony was corroborated by Mr. Stroupe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.508" offset="7733373">Now, Mr. Stroupe was the -- was the President of the Stroupe Mirror Company, one of the defendants here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.749" offset="7766392">And, he says, "I think you're entitled to consider that fact."</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.612" offset="7777782">And he points out the strains that Mr. Hearn, who was one of the active participants in this conspiracy, was not called here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.130" offset="7819891">Now, that's Judge Paul's version of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.957" offset="7835251">That's Judge -- that's the Court of Appeals' version of the facts as to Jonas' testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.097" offset="7859806">And then, we have the question of whether this motion for the production of the grand jury testimony, which was made to Judge Paul, it was addressed to his discretion, whether it made the arguments that Mr. Morrison has made here this morning, and the answer to that appears very clearly in the record, 263 and 264, the motion is for the production of Mr. Jonas' testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.881" offset="8002853">There are no reasons given for it on the ground that Jonas is crucial but his testimony is suspect, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.927" offset="8035035">Mr. Morison has referred Your Honors to the colloquy on page 259.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.528" offset="8061471">Well, at the bottom of the page there, Mr. Homer Carlson, speaking for all the defense counsels says, "We want a transcript of his testimony before the grand jury regarding the subjects to which he, Jonas, has testified on direct examination."</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.783" offset="8118523">The Court "Exactly, and you can do that for each witness and you get a complete transcript of the testimony before the grand jury, and that is not permissible."</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.195" offset="8152168">Now, what was the response for that?</text>

            <text syncTime="2581.026" offset="10427434">251, thank you very much.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.001" offset="10435375">Now, on this -- if I may -- if I might give you a record reference for what I said just a moment ago about their not cross-examining Jonas after this effort to discredit him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.838" offset="10494725">This -- that appears in the record at page 296 and 297.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.307" offset="10524609">Can -- this is a colloquy between court and counsel, and Judge Paul refers, this is at the bottom of the page 296, "You gentlemen, yesterday, Mr. Gilmore made a great furor and he want to examine all these records of Mr. Jonas to discredit him to affect his credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.926" offset="10603081">He wanted the statements given to counsel for the Government and they were furnished to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.785" offset="10618546">You went in there and spent an hour at this morning examining Mr. Jonas' records, and then, you come in and say, "We have nothing to ask him".</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.991" offset="10651355">That is exactly the same way you want to get hold of these grand jury minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.568" offset="10669641">You have no reason to think that there is any contradiction in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.914" offset="10683016">You just want to get hold of grand jury minutes and that's not permissible."</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.134" offset="10699943">And then, as the saying "a repetition of what appears earlier."</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.017" offset="10723453">In other words, this case and this record, we respectfully submit, do not present the question which has been argued here this morning that there was in this case a particularized showing as to a particular portion of a particular witness' testimony of a sort that made it an abusive discretion for the trial judge to refuse to inspect the minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.161" offset="10863992">That was not what they asked for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.956" offset="10875173">That is not the showing they made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.059" offset="10883636">What they asked for here was an automatic delivery of the entire transcript with Jonas' testimony and the Court of Appeals, we say, was absolutely correct in holding that no defendant either before or after Jencks was entitled to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.623" offset="10953853">Now, the argument was made this morning that this does not mean any wholesale disclosure of the grand jury testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.416" offset="11005053">Well, the -- the only basis for the inspection of disclosure here was he testified before the -- had testified before the grand jury, and we see no answer to the Chief Justice's observation yesterday that you can make the same showing as to every witness at the trial who has testified before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.724" offset="11086242">And, presumably when the grand jury indicts, it does so on the basis of incriminating testimony and the witnesses, or at least many of them who appeared before the grand jury, are bound to be called to testify at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.965" offset="11143189">And, if every witness who has testified before the grand jury and who testifies at the trial has his grand jury testimony turned over to the defense, we think you have the same kind of wholesale disclosure, the same kind of wholesale breach of secrecy that this Court last term, in the Procter and Gamble case, rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.908" offset="11251022">Now --</text>

            <text syncTime="2787.723" offset="11254262">What kind of showing do you think it would be necessary to make in order to get the use of testimony that had been given before the grand jury on the same subject?</text>

            <label>Mr. Philip Elman</label>
            <text syncTime="2797.753" offset="11294386">Well, we think -- we think, in the first place, it's always -- it's always open to the defense to cross-examine the witness as to whether he testified before the grand jury and what his testimony was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.400" offset="11344959">It's -- the defense in cross-examination can attempt to breakdown his story in every way it can.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.722" offset="11386232">It -- the defense can present other witnesses who contradict the particular witness' testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.138" offset="11423953">We think that once that is done at the trial, they will have a foundation of some sort upon which to invoke the judicial discretion of the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.533" offset="11485497">We don't think it can -- you can lay down an absolute rule that the defendant always gets it simply on the showing that the witness has testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.997" offset="11527398">We don't think you can lay down an absolute rule and the Court of Appeals didn't lay down an absolute rule that the defendant never gets it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.183" offset="11556133">And, every judge that has considered this problem, except for the judges in the Third Circuit who we think acted in almost a mechanical response to the Jencks decision, every judge who said, in the last analysis, "You've got to -- you've make -- you have to balance these rights of the defendant and of the grand jury and exercise a discretion," and it's a reviewable discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.054" offset="11667623">It's a -- and it's a discretion which we think is no different from the discretion which in other respects, a trial judge has to exercise to protect the right of the defendant, the constitutional right of the defendant to a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.154" offset="11728018">Now, there's been some reference to this being the Government's choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.041" offset="11751528">The Government choose -- chose to call this witness and the Government by doing that is waived secrecy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.216" offset="11784234">Well, one thing is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.806" offset="11794578">It is that the secrecy of the grand jury isn't the Government privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.087" offset="11811715">We're not dealing here with executive privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.386" offset="11820910">We're not dealing here with papers that belong to the executive branch of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.838" offset="11842748">We're dealing here with what is really a judicial privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.203" offset="11856227">The grand jury is an arm of the Court and the reasons for secrecy aren't to -- help the Government or to help or to protect the witnesses before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.332" offset="11908681">The reasons for secrecy are, as this Court has said several times, that it is indispensable to the grand jury as an institution which is -- which is recognized in the Bill of Rights and the Fifth Amendment as the method, the sole method, for initiating serious criminal charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.439" offset="12001155">You've got to preserve the independence of the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.793" offset="12014529">You've got to preserve the integrity of the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.148" offset="12031979">You've got to protect the grand jury sometimes from the State, the prosecution, and all that, all these reasons are for the grand jury's protection and for the protection of the community and not for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.929" offset="12099062">Now, Rule 6 (e) recognizes that very specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.675" offset="12118079">I could give you a simple example of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.174" offset="12136051">I have not read the grand jury transcript in this case for the simple reason that Rule 6 (e) says it may be read by Government attorneys only for use in the performance of their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.137" offset="12179937">I didn't think it was necessary to -- in the performance of my duties as counsel for the Government in this case in this Court to read the grand -- to read the grand jury minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.811" offset="12218598">But, suppose I had done so and suppose I had considered that it wasn't fair to my associates on the other side that I should have had the benefit of that reading and that they had not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.062" offset="12263633">Suppose I thought that it was in the interest of justice that they read those grand jury minutes and suppose I had secured the approval of the Attorney General to have them see those grand jury minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.598" offset="12317759">Could I have done so?</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.161" offset="12324028">The answer is I clearly could not because Rule 6 (e) says in the second sentence that a -- an attorney may disclose matters occurring before the grand jury only when so directed by the Court preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.828" offset="12394663">I would have had to secure an order of this Court and the permission of this Court to have counsel on the other side see these grand jury minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.122" offset="12431862">It couldn't have a clear illustration of the fact that this isn't -- these grand jury minutes don't belong to the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.539" offset="12473553">The rule permits the Government to make a record of the transcript of the grand jury proceedings and permits attorneys to use them in connection with their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.849" offset="12530813">Well, there's a very good reason why Rule 6 (e) does that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.010" offset="12547427">It's helpful not only to the Government, but it's helpful to the grand jury that there'd be a record of the proceedings, particularly, in an antitrust case such as this one where you have an industry-wide investigation and the grand jury sits over a period of months hearing scores of witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.512" offset="12633422">It would be wasteful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.444" offset="12641155">It would be uneconomical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.394" offset="12648991">It would be a very foolish way of doing business not to have some record of the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.294" offset="12672502">It would be very important not only to determine whom to indict, but whom not to indict, to know what the testimony was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.334" offset="12708760">Leads given by the testimony have to be explored.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.958" offset="12739166">The use of the making of a record and the use of that record is -- has been deemed by the Court and the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.028" offset="12771453">And, the rule as I -- the Court knows, was submitted by Congress as the force of statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.721" offset="12794232">It was deemed appropriate and right that the Government should be able to use that procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.229" offset="12824325">Now, are we to say that, because that procedure is followed and the Government does make a record that somehow the Government's action prejudices the right of the grand jury as secrecy?</text>

            <text syncTime="3284.711" offset="13242180">You let me take a look at those minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.689" offset="13250121">I just -- I want to see what he said before the grand jury."</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.696" offset="13262137">Now, I -- we recognize that protection of the rights of the defendant in this particular regard must be left to the good sense, the wisdom of the trial judge, but if -- but that is the only way, you can -- we think, that you can balance these two rights, both of them of importance to the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.502" offset="13365373">It's just as important to the accused, to the citizens, that there'd be an independent grand jury which can have testimony before it which is uninhibited and unrestrained by publicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.941" offset="13435173">And, as the Court said last term in Procter and Gamble, the grand jury, as a public institution serving the community, might suffer if those testifying today knew that the secrecy of their testimony would be lifted tomorrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.032" offset="13503509">So that, it's no answer to say that once the witness has testified, once the grand jury has concluded its deliberations, then all the reasons for secrecy disappear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.159" offset="13548022">That were an answer -- that would have been an answer long before the Jencks case and there's nothing new about the Jencks case that deals with this proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.351" offset="13592743">What -- what Your Honors are being asked now is to make a drastic far-reaching departure from established law and we think that if the Court is to consider that, it should have the benefit of the experience, and it should have the benefit of the views of those who are familiar with the grand jury as a functioning institution.</text>

            <text syncTime="3409.741" offset="13742373">And, if the matter were dealt with in -- through the rule making process, the Court could then call upon experienced trial judges -- experienced federal trial judges who are -- who have first-hand experience with the trial jury and who can tell Your Honors whether it would not -- would or would not impair the efficiency of the grand jury to lift the secrecy of its proceedings in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.761" offset="13874448">You could -- you could call upon those who were experienced with the state court and who could tell Your Honors whether or not the decline of the grand jury in the states is or is not attributable to the fact that there has been a breach of secrecy to a large extent in state procedure.</text>

            <label>Mr. H. Graham Morison</label>
            <text syncTime="3468.797" offset="13978520">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.609" offset="13993775">I first want to come back, Mr. Chief Justice, to the first point I addressed to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.516" offset="14013419">It's raised again by Government counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.539" offset="14021569">The implication seems to be raised by my Brother that there is something inherent in the facts in this case that would entitle us to ask for every witness' grand jury testimony, and we have denied that that's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.495" offset="14097324">Now, a discussion ensued yesterday with Pittsburgh counsel about the ruling in Socony-Vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.563" offset="14125641">And, I want to compare that case with this to show you that we think that if the trial judge does exercise and must exercise his discretion that has got to value the impact of the witness on the defense in every case, and that when he finds, as in this case, that it was damaging, then, justice would require that access be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.177" offset="14244028">Now, in Socony-Vacuum, what was the situation?</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.753" offset="14258343">There, the Government's witnesses were employees of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.780" offset="14278510">When the Government put them on the stand, they were less than -- they needed to be prodded along and the Government used the grand jury transcript to refresh their recollection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.309" offset="14340577">At that moment, counsel for defense jumped and said, "Now, we want Your Honor to read all of these witnesses' grand jury -- all of the grand jury testimony into the record," and the judge properly said, "No.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.135" offset="14399927">These are friendly witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.593" offset="14409749">You undoubtedly have talked with these witnesses and they've told you what the questions were before the grand jury and what their answers were."</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.208" offset="14444231">Again, we think in Socony-Vacuum that the Court properly exercised that discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.704" offset="14474219">Now, the Government note that we -- as they often do, that we didn't cross-examine extensively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.018" offset="14535450">I adverted to that earlier by saying this is a trial lawyer's judgment in the forum as to what you should do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.211" offset="14580172">We exercised it one way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.030" offset="14591457">Now, this Court will recall that, in the Palermo case argued here yesterday, the Government said they can't have access to documents because you had extensive cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.973" offset="14651225">Now, all I am saying, Your Honors, is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.735" offset="14682363">My Brother Elman, like myself, is an advocate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.777" offset="14714441">He seeks to aid the prosecution and what he has said is to restrict this in order that the prosecution may be aided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.020" offset="14755401">Now, this business about who raised the privilege, well, the Government raised the privilege in this case of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.131" offset="14787897">Their voice could hardly be heard, however, because of the judge's ruling which was so quick.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.693" offset="14830111">Now, coming to the second phase of the question, what is the trial judge's discretion?</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.249" offset="14860413">And, I want to say it again that we believe the proper standard says that the trial judge of course retains under 6 (e) his discretion in every phase of the case and that when a request comes, he must of necessity, in the proper exercise of his discretion, evaluate the impact of the Government's witness upon the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.191" offset="14948185">And, if he finds, as here, that he was extremely damaging, then we believe that he should give access to those grand jury minutes for the purpose -- the most essential purpose in criminal jurisprudence, to attack the credibility of the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.117" offset="15043793">Now, I would like to point out again Mr. Elman has been very helpful in almost a seminar way in suggesting that this is a difficult problem of the public interest of weighing and balancing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.838" offset="15102725">We concede that it is, but we don't think that advances the situation to simply say that there must be some inherent change in 6 (e) that calls for Congress and great convening of jurors to decide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.717" offset="15170226">We believe that this is something that this Court has had to decide over and over, and over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.931" offset="15191124">What are the proper standards in fair play in justice that must be applied as a guide to the Courts to see that justice is done?</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.154" offset="15240025">Now, I'd like Mr. Chief Justice to note the impact of the court below's standards, if I may.</text>

            <label>Mr. H. Graham Morison</label>
            <text syncTime="3795.427" offset="15285060">We'd like to point out, Your Honor, that the court below, noting that the judge had applied this improper standard of prior inconsistency, they nevertheless sustained him on the basis that we had not specifically requested in camera inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.995" offset="15351306">But, whether that was an error or not, certainly the prejudice of this defendant should not be permitted to continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3819.301" offset="15380564">And, I challenge this thing that the dogs might sleep at night.</text>
            <text syncTime="3827.334" offset="15412746">I have never seen the grand jury testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.739" offset="15426330">The trial judge has never seen it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3833.421" offset="15437093">The Court of Appeals in the Fourth Circuit has never seen it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.055" offset="15447542">And this Court has never seen it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3839.091" offset="15459767">And, I submit Your Honors, let us suppose, as suppose we must, that in three days of grand jury testimony, there is exculpatory material helpful in clarifying the search for truth for this defendant Messer who could not speak for himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3858.419" offset="15537089">That's the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3860.056" offset="15543568">Now, the Fourth Circuit in dealing with that has rejected the Third Circuit's rule in the -- in Rosenberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="3867.040" offset="15571571">It has adopted a rule and the Government seeks this Court to support a rule which modifies the more intermediate Second Circuit rule, as in Spangelet, in these respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3878.326" offset="15616711">First, the trial judge is not required to make any inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3883.287" offset="15636564">Second, if he does make an inspection, it must be limited to particular points, sharply in issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3891.810" offset="15670627">And third, even if the judge does find an inconsistency, he is not required to reveal it if he believes it to be inconsequential.</text>
            <text syncTime="3900.230" offset="15704273">And we believe, Mr. Chief Justice, that that means that there will never be inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3904.257" offset="15720364">Thank you, sir.</text>
