            <label>Mr. David Previant</label>
            <text syncTime="20.228" offset="184299">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.249" offset="196420">This case comes here on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.970" offset="219303">It presents the question whether the state court had the jurisdiction to enjoin peaceful picketing at the site of a county building project during the course of a dispute between the union and the private contractors who were under contract with the County to build this project.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.473" offset="301223">It involves the familiar question to this Court of preemption, question of federal v. state powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.065" offset="331630">The facts are simple and substantially undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.199" offset="360155">The petitioners are a local labor union and the Building Trades Council which is comprised of delegates from affiliated local unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.254" offset="400384">The respondents are the County of Door, a political subdivision of the State of Wisconsin, the municipal corporation, Arnold Zahn, a plumbing contractor and Theodore Oudenhoven, a general contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.984" offset="467257">Early in 1957, the County determined to build an addition to its existing courthouse facility, and in accordance with Wisconsin's statute, let the job out for bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.296" offset="512606">Number of individual craft bids were sought as well as a general contractor bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.804" offset="534549">The respondent, Oudenhoven who was the general contractor on the job was an organized contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.120" offset="559835">He was working under contract with the various labor unions, whose members were in his employ.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.986" offset="583346">The respondent, Zahn, the successful bidder for the plumbing contract was an unorganized contractor, neither he nor any of his employees worked under contract with the Plumbers' Union or were they members of that union.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.897" offset="638934">The petitioners, that is the Plumbers' Union here, sought a contract with Zahn upon learning that he was bidding for or had received the bid, but they were unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.018" offset="679476">When the job started, a single picket patrolled the premises of which the addition was being constructed.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.133" offset="707897">They could carry the simple sign saying that the employees were not union and there was -- and there is no charge here that the picketing was other than peaceful and in complete compliance with all relevant laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.736" offset="770278">As a result of the picket and as was anticipated, other union working men employed by other union contractors refuse to enter on the job site to perform the services, as a result of which the job came to a stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.808" offset="846555">The -- the distinguishing feature here from the cases which have previously come to this Court was here, the County, joined with the two private contractors and filed a joint complaint against the local labor union and its affiliate, Building Trades Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.095" offset="943731">Claiming that there was no labor dispute as that term was defined under Wisconsin law, and alleging a violation of Wisconsin statutes, the union defended both on the merits on what is relevant here on the theory of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.369" offset="1012799">There's no -- there's no question in this case, but that there were some $225,000 or almost a quarter of a million dollars of products used on this job which originated at points outside the State of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.115" offset="1075806">The trial court found that the picketing was unlawful, found that it didn't comport with the Wisconsin definition of a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.426" offset="1109034">It also found that it was for the purpose of coercing the nonunion contractor to in turn force his employees to join the union against their will.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.368" offset="1140799">This is a violation of a statute of the State of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.911" offset="1158980">According, and also, for the purpose of getting a contract for the union, trial court accordingly entered both temporary and finally, permanent injunction against all picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.168" offset="1204015">The case was then taken to the Wisconsin Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.808" offset="1218644">Wisconsin Supreme Court on the merits found that there was unlawful picketing for an unlawful purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.715" offset="1246229">The Court in -- for the basis of its opinion without discussing commerce, assume that there was commerce present, but found that there was no preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.166" offset="1284054">And it reason that sense under the definition of “employer”, the political subdivisions of the State were expressly excluded, and since under the definition of “person”, there was no expressed inclusion of the sovereignty of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.576" offset="1345703">Therefore, the Taft-Hartley Act in any of its aspect could not be applied to the particular dispute and therefore, there was no basis for it to invoke the theory or to apply the theory urged by the plaintiff -- by the unions that there was preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.710" offset="1414248">And coming to this conclusion, it stated its expressed disagreement with a prior holding of the National Labor Relations Board, which is subsequently affirmed by the Court of Appeals of the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.335" offset="1468688">This was the Local 313 case which we have referred to in our brief in which the Board and its brief amicus analyzes very thoroughly.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.909" offset="1507035">There was one concurring opinion, which accepted the decision and the construction of the statute as presented by the National Labor Relations Board in the Electrical Workers case as affirmed by the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.723" offset="1566281">But felt that there was no preemption here because what was the application of the doctrine of preemption here would result in an intrusion on the essential functions of local government.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.262" offset="1616436">The Court reasoned that the construction of an addition to a courthouse was such an essential function of local government that it was not reasonable, not likely that Congress could have intended or that the Congress has in fact could have prevented the State from protecting that kind of a construction even if a labor dispute arose which under ordinary circumstances would come within the contents of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.652" offset="1721971">There was one dissenting opinion who applied the usual rules that have been expressed by this Court and who have pointed out the danger of conflict of remedies in this large area of public construction in the event the majority has prevailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.708" offset="1790203">The operating language of the statute -- I would profess it by saying this.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.375" offset="1824893">The particular facts which the Court found resulted in the violation of Wisconsin law would if also found by the National Labor Relations Board have resulted in a violation of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.441" offset="1889155">Without arguing the -- whether or not the record would sustain such finding or whether the Board would make such finding, although we believe that is implicit in the whole problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.020" offset="1923427">If these facts are also in violation of the federal act, then there would be no question of a conflict of remedies and that the superior authority of the Congress would prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.203" offset="1976195">The operating statute in the federal act was so called Secondary Boycotts statute 8 (b) (4) (A).</text>
            <text syncTime="476.550" offset="2009527">The operating words are that it is an unlawful labor practice for a union to induce the employees of an employer to cease their employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.734" offset="2046307">It -- and the purpose is to force or require an employer or other person to cease doing business with any other person, of course they're operating in a difficult word is the word “person”, because we must conceive that by definition, neither the State nor its political subdivisions are employers and they come within the reach then of the Secondary Boycott provision of the Act only if they may be called persons.</text>

            <text syncTime="648.774" offset="2698428">I think that both the presenting opinion and the concurring opinion demonstrate the fallacy right within the opinion when they suggest that perhaps if this were a lawful strike, if these were lawful activities, there would be no problem and they could not restrain that conduct even though it was an interference with an essential government, but then they turn to the fact that this is an unlawful activity under the state law.</text>

            <text syncTime="722.227" offset="2992253">The question is whether or not the Constitution has delegated to the Congress the right to act in a certain field and if it has, it cannot unlawfully intrude upon the function of state government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1167.028" offset="4771506">It was some nine years prior to the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act which made it a -- by a par type act so to speak, and at that time, referring to the congressional record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.190" offset="4816123">Senator Wagner was concerned solely with the fact that there are many municipal corporations or political subdivisions of a state, which had been receiving very lucrative contracts from the Federal Government, but that they had been engaging in unfair labor practices or what would have been unfair labor practices had they come within the definition of employer, and he thought that any person doing business with the United States Government should be required to comply with the laws of the Government as they apply to the private person doing business, the individual citizen doing business with the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.633" offset="4969932">That was why in 1938, he had proposed that the -- that the definition of the word person be enlarged.</text>

            <text syncTime="1529.263" offset="6220466">Mr. Chief Justice Warren, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.183" offset="6240110">It is the position of the respondent Door County et al. that the essence of this case is the determination of the applicability of the Taft-Hartley Act to the factual situation and I would like to go in a little more in detail to the factual situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.111" offset="6351809">Door County had in the course of -- of its functioning as a municipal government let contracts for the construction of this courthouse addition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.940" offset="6407084">The contracts were left as Mr. Previant has said to one nonunion contractor and nine or ten union contractors as soon as the nonunion contractor went on the job, a picket was placed on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.601" offset="6469778">At that time, the courthouse was partially in the state of construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.359" offset="6492766">The record shows that there was interference with the business and conduct of the operation of the governmental offices in the courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.519" offset="6541458">The problem then was what to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.270" offset="6568417">We had let the bids as the Wisconsin statute states to the lowest responsible bidder as a requirement of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.723" offset="6610213">The law required that there be separate plumbing, heating and ventilating, electrical and construction contracts so that there was no opportunity to join the plumbing contract with the general contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.573" offset="6673638">The -- I believe that the cases under Wisconsin law states that we couldn't use tax money to buy us contract or to pay them the profit on this contractor and say we're going to give them another contract because I believe that that would be an illegal use of funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.228" offset="6756289">The -- although I didn't know it at the time that the case was in the no man's land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.996" offset="6791398">So the process of construction in the courthouse was at a standstill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.542" offset="6813550">The only recourse that we had was to apply to the Circuit Court for an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.423" offset="6857017">And the injunction was granted within ten days, which of course did not impede for commerce, rather, accelerated them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.596" offset="6921801">It's those facts --</text>

            <text syncTime="1713.774" offset="6958477">It's -- it's that factual situation to which we have to relate the interpretation of a person, an employer-employee under its federal act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.995" offset="7015320">The 20 -- Local 25, the piggy-back case of course referred to railroads and because the Railway Management Act excludes employer-employee relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.334" offset="7068714">That was carried through into the 313, the Electrical Workers 313 case, which is the stumbling block in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.586" offset="7105703">If the Third Circuit Court of Appeals was right and their decision didn't go into basis with the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.870" offset="7142902">It merely said the National Labor Relations Board took jurisdiction and we will go with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.199" offset="7176129">The Board had -- in a case involving a municipality, similar to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.116" offset="7203819">The Board had previously said a municipality is not a person under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.892" offset="7226911">The Local 25 case changed the determination of the Board and under the 313 case, the Third Circuit Court says, no, you may in a situation like this bring your action before the Board where it involves a municipality because a municipality is defined as a person under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.006" offset="7319385">The peculiar situation it seems to me involved here is that under the definition of the Act, the State has control of its employer-employee relationships, but when a stranger picket comes on the job affecting the aberration of the municipality, there is no control, and it would seem that in the aberration of the municipality, it would be more important, or at least as important to have control of stranger picketing as -- such as took place in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.591" offset="7489703">The Board -- the -- this Court has many times stated that the areas of control by the State are left open.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.417" offset="7549053">There is no determination made which rules this case other than the Third Circuit Court case.</text>
