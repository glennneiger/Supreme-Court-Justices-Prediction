            <label>Mr. J. Gerald Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="21.625" offset="189837">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.157" offset="215960">The question that arises in this case is whether or not the Territory of Alaska may continue to collect taxes from delinquent taxpayers after the taxing statute has been repealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.000" offset="295372">In 1949, for the first time, the Legislature of the Territory of Alaska passed a general property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.363" offset="344795">This was Chapter 10, Session Laws of Alaska, 1949 and it places or placed a 1% or 10 mills levy on all real and personal property within the entire Territory of Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.006" offset="431417">Now, there were some peculiar modifications of the peculiar aspects of Chapter 10, Session Laws of Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.964" offset="467257">For instance, the Act provided that municipalities, school districts, and public utility districts could keep the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.025" offset="527444">Now, many of the cities at that time were levying -- levying 20 mills, and the school districts and -- school districts and public utility districts, generally, 8, 9 to 10 mil.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.704" offset="582196">It was the position of the Territory of Alaska and has been that the first 10 mills that every city levied -- was levied under Chapter 10, and the Act provided that they could keep that 10 mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.129" offset="635904">Now, I -- I point that out because it will become apparent to you, later on, as I argue about Chapter 22, Session Laws of 1953, which repealed Chapter 10, Session Laws of Alaska in Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.616" offset="709883">But in Section 2 (a) of the Act, it does not repeal Chapter 10, Session Laws of Alaska, 1949 as to municipalities, public utility districts, and school districts until the end of the fiscal year of 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.531" offset="805491">Now, they didn't say calendar year, they said fiscal year.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.617" offset="813850">And I assume that that was put on because of the different -- municipalities had different fiscal years.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.666" offset="842062">But for all practical purposes it would be for the calendar year 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.398" offset="872991">Now, this Chapter 10, Session Laws of Alaska has had a long and checkered career through the Courts of Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.261" offset="908413">I've been Attorney General now for almost 10 years and it's practically been my whole career, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.365" offset="948851">Shortly after the Act was passed, William Hess, a mining man in Fairbanks, Alaska brought an action against the Territory, filed this action in the Fourth Division District Courts sought to enjoin Mr. Mullaney, the Tax Commissioner, from enforcing this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.436" offset="1021158">A preliminary injunction was granted by Judge Kraft on the 30th day of January, 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.596" offset="1061804">Then that -- that preliminary injunction was made permanent by the same court on June the 19th, 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.781" offset="1102451">On May the 10th, the Territory then took an appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.625" offset="1137873">And on May the 10th, 1951, the Ninth Circuit Court said that the taxpayer had sought the wrong remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.450" offset="1173191">He had an action of law that he should have paid his taxes and sued for a refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.894" offset="1199000">So, on June the 8th, 1951, Mr. Hess, having paid his tax, again filed another action to the District Court of the Fourth Division for the return of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.635" offset="1249886">Territory moved for change of venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.858" offset="1258768">The case was transferred to the First Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.597" offset="1277785">And on February the 18th, 1952, the District Court for the First Division of Alaska held that Chapter 10, Session Laws of Alaska, 1949 was a valid taxing statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.306" offset="1332642">The taxpayer then took an appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court, on August the 4th, 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.188" offset="1368168">On May the 25th, 1954, more than a year, Your Honors, after the Legislature of Alaska had repealed Chapter 10, Session Laws of Alaska, 1949, by Chapter 22, Session Laws of Alaska, 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.448" offset="1449148">We got our decision from the Ninth Circuit Court affirming the District Court's holding that this was a valid taxing statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.549" offset="1501602">Up until that time the Territory collected some $400,000 and under this taxing statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.237" offset="1524276">There left as near as we could estimate some million and a quarter dollars remaining from taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.825" offset="1546637">That said portion which would go to the Territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.912" offset="1559071">So we -- my office decided that we would then start to try to collect this by suits since the taxpayers were not voluntarily paying.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.592" offset="1601703">We chose eight companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.059" offset="1607659">We filed eight separate actions seeking a total of approximately $175,000 in taxes, interests, and penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.828" offset="1646634">And it is the consolidation of those cases which is now before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.509" offset="1677458">We filed these cases or these suits in April and May of 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.098" offset="1707760">On the taxes were for the years 1949, 1950, 1951 and 1952, not for all taxpayers for all years but all years where covered by suits against some of the taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.884" offset="1774947">On June -- on January the 4th, 1956, the District Court at Juneau dismissed the Territory's complaints, first, on the ground that no personal action would lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.566" offset="1829595">And second, that the tax did not survive the repeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.315" offset="1868675">On February the 7th, 1956, the Territory appealed the case to the Ninth Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.621" offset="1897827">On November the 14th, 1956 at a hearing before the Ninth Circuit, the Court decided that they had no jurisdiction for the reason that the Court, in the opinion of the Ninth Circuit Court, had failed to enter a final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.203" offset="1972224">So on December the 11th, 1956, the District Court in Juneau did enter what was then considered a sufficient final order.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.105" offset="2011826">And the Territory took a new appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court on -- on June the 27th.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.091" offset="2039724">And on June the 27th, 1957, the Ninth Circuit Court, by a two-to-one decision, held that Section 2 -- yes, Section 2 (a) of Chapter 22, Session Laws of 1953, forgave the taxes, wiped them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.397" offset="2124988">That there was no tax liability left and that we could not collect the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.496" offset="2161351">Then of course, the Territory filed a petition for rehearing and pointed out to the Court, this petition is filed April the 7th, 1958, and pointed out to the Ninth Circuit Court that should they let that decision stand, it would be in violation -- Chapter 22, Session Laws of Alaska, 1953, would be in violation of the constitutional privileges afforded citizens under the Fourteenth Amendment and also, it would violate the requirement of uniformity of taxes as set forth in Section 9 of the Organic Act which is the Constitution of the Territory of Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.044" offset="2359568">Petition for rehearing was denied and certiorari -- a writ of certiorari filed and certiorari granted by this Court on April the 7th, 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.519" offset="2417455">I think I misquoted the date here to you just a minute ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.976" offset="2427277">The -- our petition for rehearing was denied on December the 4th, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.855" offset="2454758">Now, let us look closely at this language of Chapter 22, Session Laws of Alaska, 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.963" offset="2495195">You will find it on page -- set forth in full on page 5 of petitioner's brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="792.864" offset="3274794">“There was a logical reason for granting this right to these local districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.461" offset="3293184">In that the Legislature may well have felt it undesirable to interfere with their current fiscal programs whether or not the levies made for that year had yet been made."</text>
            <text syncTime="810.384" offset="3344906">And, Mr. Justice Whittaker, you see, the reason why I think it is so important and of the reason why in 1953 I thought it was important for the Senate Finance or Senate Judicial Committee -- I think it was that finally put this amendment into it.</text>

            <text syncTime="848.909" offset="3499029">Now, if the Legislature wiped out that authority to levy that tax, here, the municipalities would be caught without any authority to levy that first 10 mills that they levied 20 mills for the first 10 under Chapter 10, the other -- the second 10 mills under their own taxing statutes or ordinances.</text>

            <text syncTime="3621.611" offset="14589785">As the Attorney General pointed out this property tax in Alaska has had a checkered career.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.695" offset="14622177">Its validity was challenged and before any taxes levied under the Act became due and payable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.550" offset="14653524">And that -- the -- the question of its validity was in litigation throughout the entire course of the Act's history and was not finally determined until about a year after the Legislature repealled it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.670" offset="14710053">Throughout the several sessions of the Legislatures were held after the Act was enacted, various efforts were made to repeal it or to modify it and many bills were introduced for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.259" offset="14768358">And in one bill, amended form, House Bill Number 3 eventually became a law on March 12th, 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.252" offset="14808377">Now, the question, the constitutional feature of this matter which -- adverted to by the Attorney General in the closing part of his argument, and I -- I should like to present my views upon that aspect of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.328" offset="14860727">As Attorney General says, the constitutional matter was not suggested in the courts below either on the argument or in the written briefs until the petition for rehearing was filed in the Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.805" offset="14926555">And it is my view or our view that it was injected at that time in order to lay a foundation for the petition for certiorari which was later filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.227" offset="14988309">The trial court decided the case upon the same legal theories, the same authorities, and substantially the same reason as was followed in the appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.597" offset="15061765">And the Territory saw no constitutional problem there, nor any -- nor did they suggest any violation over the last -- this Organic Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3751.444" offset="15109099">Here, after having suggested in the petition for rehearing, the Territory devotes a considerable amount of space in its brief and upon the oral argument to the constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.444" offset="15173151">Now, we don't think the question exists nor do we think that the Territory has the power to raise it or the authority to raise it if it did exist either here or in the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.372" offset="15236890">And I'm not basing that simply upon the ground that they failed to raise it below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3788.282" offset="15256534">I think they had no authority to raise it below and no authority to raise it here.</text>

            <text syncTime="4088.090" offset="16455764">Puerto Rico versus the Secretary of Agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="4090.858" offset="16466840">I believe it's cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4092.026" offset="16471437">I -- I have -- now, as I say, we don't think the Fourteenth Amendment applies under territorial status.</text>
            <text syncTime="4102.741" offset="16514382">But our own Circuit Court of Appeals from the Ninth Circuit has on several occasions construed the Alaska Organic Act, which contains the Section 9 of which contains the equal protection clause which was mentioned here by the Attorney General in his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4120.955" offset="16587212">They construed it in reference to this Taxing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4126.051" offset="16607587">They were -- they construed it in reference to other classifications imposed by the territorial legislature in other Taxing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4133.926" offset="16639039">And on the basis of the rule on Madden versus Kentucky, it held that the Section 9 of the Alaska Organic Act requires no greater uniformity, at least no greater uniformity, than the Fourteenth Amendment would if it were applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4151.881" offset="16710928">And this held that under that rule, classifications such as this are not in violation of the Organic Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4159.624" offset="16741857">Now, that was the question that it took the Court so many years to decide in this Alaska Property Tax Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4167.370" offset="16772890">Whether the efforts of the territorial legislature to impose this tax on property located outside the municipalities and school districts alone, and leave to the municipalities and school districts the discretion to impose it within their limits and to retain the money for their own purposes if they didn't decide to levy, whether that type of a classification violated the Organic Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4197.533" offset="16893471">The Circuit Court who largely based upon Madden versus Kentucky said it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4204.561" offset="16921579">This Court refused certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="4207.975" offset="16935267">Similar situation applied with reference to the Alaskan net income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="4212.030" offset="16951463">So that it is our view that that question is settled as far as the Ninth Circuit is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4221.263" offset="16988453">It's -- it's a question of statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4225.568" offset="17005693">The Organic Act is an Act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4228.360" offset="17016769">We treat it as a territory's constitution but it's an Act of Congress like any other Act and it has a settled line of Ninth Circuit decisions with reference to its classification, to the classifications that are permitted under which we believe are conclusive here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4246.730" offset="17090330">And we've cited those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4248.907" offset="17099003">The Hess versus Mullaney, that's the litigation involving this Property Tax Act and other cases involving the Alaska Net Income Tax Act, so that we think they are conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4263.989" offset="17159293">Now, I -- I want to turn to what I think is the -- the point of controversy in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4270.744" offset="17186356">And that's the legal effect of this repealing Act, Chapter 22, the Session Laws of 1953 repealing the Alaska Property Tax Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4282.620" offset="17233899">Now, if the Act with the way the Attorney General would like to have agreed, and I -- I think that there might be some point to his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4302.681" offset="17314147">But the Act doesn't say what the Attorney General seeks to make it say.</text>
            <text syncTime="4310.258" offset="17344449">Section 2 of the Repealing Act was saved from the effect of the repeal, any taxes which have been levied.</text>
            <text syncTime="4321.248" offset="17388335">Now, the Attorney General wants to say that, that means any tax which have or are levied during the current fiscal year, but it doesn't say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4331.536" offset="17429504">It said any taxes that have been levied.</text>
            <text syncTime="4334.503" offset="17441416">And it can only be read to mean taxes levied during into life of the Act, from 1949 until the date of repeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4347.351" offset="17492825">English language won't -- won't permit any other interpretation to -- to -- to be placed upon it.</text>
