            <text syncTime="59.585" offset="341661">This case is in this Court by a writ of certiorari to the Criminal Court of Appeals of the State of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.231" offset="384293">The defendant -- the petitioner in this case, Edward Leon Williams, was charged in Muskogee County, Oklahoma of the murder of Tommy Cooke.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.774" offset="450435">The murder was -- have taken place on June 17th, 1956.On November the 19th of 1956, the petitioner here pled guilty and received a life sentence to the charge of murder in Muskogee County.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.612" offset="545834">Then -- then on December 17th of 1956, approximately, in other words 30 days after the plea of guilty in Muskogee County where he received life for the murder, the County Attorney of Tulsa County had the petitioner brought to Tulsa County and there he was charged with two other crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.290" offset="632560">He was charged with armed robbery and he was charged with kidnapping.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.828" offset="658683">The kidnapping was of this same victim namely Tommy Cooke.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.305" offset="680626">The kidnapping took place also on June the 17th, 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.720" offset="702255">The robbery with firearms was of another victim and there is no appeal to this Court on the robbery with firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.713" offset="734229">We are concerned here with the kidnapping prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.661" offset="753977">On January the 30th, 1957 the petitioner entered a plea of guilty to both of the charges, both the armed robbery and the kidnapping.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.257" offset="800371">At that time a long statement was made by the County Attorney and which was set forth in full in the record of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.892" offset="834957">This is of course an appeal from a sentence which was entered by the Court, not by a jury and entered on a plea of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.201" offset="880201">At the same time the petitioner through his counsel entered the record of the trial judge in Muskogee County who had handled the previous murder conviction of this same Tommy Cooke, this was done of course purposely.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.265" offset="964420">And the record of the Muskogee judge is set forth in full in the record before this Court from the point that the petitioner entered his plea of guilty in Muskogee County.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.312" offset="1024606">And I call that to the Court's attention because it indicates in there why the trial judge in Muskogee County gave this petitioner a life sentence for the murder of this Tommy Robert Cooke.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.615" offset="1085837">Now, I should also add that the petitioner was represented by two public defenders myself and Mr. Fred Woodson, we were both assigned to the case in about the 1st of January, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.781" offset="1162533">He had already been arraigned and was then before the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.694" offset="1194193">On February the 1st, the Court sentenced the petitioner to 50 years for the armed robbery, and as I've mentioned that was of another victim, but the armed robbery occurred on June the 16th, just one day before this kidnapping that we are appealing on and the murder.</text>

            <text syncTime="299.187" offset="1300146">He received 50 years for the armed robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.770" offset="1310490">Then the Court sentenced the man, petitioner-defendant, to death for the kidnapping.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.429" offset="1349047">This was on the recommendation of the County Attorney of Tulsa County.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.056" offset="1375587">Following that -- actually I should also add this that I did not represent the man at these hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.434" offset="1413099">You will note in the record that Mr. Fred Woodson, the other public defendant represented the petitioner during the actual hearing before the Court, however, naturally we discussed the case thoroughly and I felt that we were doing the right thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.615" offset="1485824">Following the death sentence we gave notice of appeal, filed a motion for trial, which was overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.856" offset="1510797">We appealed to the Criminal Court of Appeals, Oklahoma, briefs were filed and oral argument was heard.</text>

            <text syncTime="367.229" offset="1572237">The truth of the matter is, the record will show clearly that the information on the kidnapping and the information on the armed robbery and the hearings on both, while the information were separate, the hearings were combined.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.670" offset="1646007">It -- you can't distinguish actually between what's being said about the armed robbery and what's being said about the kidnapping.</text>

            <text syncTime="3548.365" offset="14296795">The Court went along with the idea that the intent was the same and here it was the same, the reason for the kidnapping presumably, and the reason for the murder was to escape capture.</text>

            <text syncTime="3919.758" offset="15782431">And I have been accustomed in the few days I have looked at the case to call him Pete, however his name is Edward Leon Williams and I would like with permission of the Court to introduce by mapping out the route of march of misconduct of this Edward Leon Williams, so that this Court may know what was in the minds of the trial judges of Tulsa County upon two criminal charges and of Muskogee County upon the murder charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.523" offset="15929448">Now, these things were emblazoned in the newspapers, public newspapers of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3964.994" offset="15963303">And thus this crime spree began in the wee hours of a Saturday morning in Tulsa.</text>
            <text syncTime="3974.983" offset="16003323">Tulsa City, I would say of 300,000 people, am I right?</text>
            <text syncTime="3981.540" offset="16029550">Maybe a little wrong, Oklahoma City is about 400,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3986.912" offset="16050970">These are the two cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3988.287" offset="16056508">Oklahoma City is not mentioned or mixed up in this route of march that I am going to delineate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3995.388" offset="16084929">And in Tulsa, at 1 o'clock in the morning on Friday the 16th of June, this young man comes upon the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="4007.051" offset="16131532">I say young, he is 27 years of age at the time he was arraigned, and he was about 20, between 25 and 26 at the time he showed up at a filling station, an all night filling station in Tulsa at 1 o'clock in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="4024.029" offset="16199450">At South Park, Tulsa he showed up in his car, a Pontiac or somebody's car he was driving and he ordered the tank filled and the attendant at 1 o'clock in the morning filled the tank and the young man as a method of payment, reached in the seat of his car and pulled out a .38 pistol and told the young man in no uncertain terms that he wanted -- he had got the gasoline, that he wanted the money and he took $30 from this young tenant there in the morning and drove away.</text>
            <text syncTime="4063.994" offset="16359320">And then he somehow or other somebody must have known something because the law, the police, the city police of Tulsa came upon him perhaps two or three hours later and there ensued an automobile chase in the Southeastern part of Tulsa, this was after daylight, the stick up was 1 o'clock in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="4090.250" offset="16464332">And the chase was on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4092.835" offset="16474676">And this fellow wrecked his Pontiac car in his anxiety and in his speed to elude the local police, he wrecked it and here is the thing that happened at the wreck.</text>
            <text syncTime="4113.162" offset="16555969">Somehow or other he got away from the wreck and entered a concrete culvert, evidently under a street down there in Southeast Tulsa and made his escape by crawling through a concrete culvert and thus upon the other side of the road or railroad or whatever it was eluding the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="4138.108" offset="16655757">And he stayed ahead, he doesn't come upon the scene then, that was Saturday.</text>
            <text syncTime="4144.935" offset="16683133">He comes upon the scene then Sunday evening in Tulsa, at 5:30 in the evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="4154.553" offset="16721586">When he is standing at a stoplight, an operating stoplight after a place, a corner in the metropolitan section of Tulsa, which is known as Third and Cheyenne Street, a stoplight was operating, cars were passing to and fro.</text>
            <text syncTime="4176.550" offset="16809566">This fellow with the pistol and the one successful hold up saw a car, approached and stopped -- the stoplight.</text>
            <text syncTime="4185.761" offset="16846451">He went out, opened the door, and introduced and reinforced by his .38 pistol, he took a seat by the side of this total stranger who happened to be a young ministerial student.</text>
            <text syncTime="4206.779" offset="16930461">And if I maybe pardoned for this -- for this statement, if Your Honors please, I have never -- I can't imagine two men of more singularly different strides being thrown together as were these two people forcibly when this man had introduced himself, entered the car, and the car sped away.</text>
            <text syncTime="4230.537" offset="17025546">And the hijacker, the same fellow, required this young ministerial student to drive southeast and he got out in the country as rapidly as possible because it's obvious that he is wanted for at least one hijacking and had one run away from the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="4253.200" offset="17116139">And so he required this young man to drive from Tulsa in a southeasterly direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4261.616" offset="17149785">This whole thing, the site of this whole thing is in Eastern Oklahoma, Tulsa is in a little bit northeastern, Muskogee is about 65 miles southeast of Tulsa, still in the eastern part of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4276.052" offset="17207568">They drove in the Muskogee direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4282.010" offset="17231391">And by the time that they got about seven or eight miles northwest of the metropolis or the local metropolis of Muskogee, town of about 70,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="4294.545" offset="17281546">Why, this fellow -- this fellow Leon Pete Williams was in country which he knew.</text>
            <text syncTime="4302.749" offset="17314356">And so, he drove there to this wooded area, partially settled area about 10 miles northwest of Muskogee and he even picked out a dead end dirt road out from country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4323.623" offset="17397844">He drove up this dead end road, made his driver get out of the car and the driver with his hands up, and where we get this information if Your Honors please, its Leon Pete Williams telling.</text>
            <text syncTime="4342.796" offset="17474539">The driver, the man he was about to kill with his hands up to his head stood there and received in the back of his head, behind his right ear one bullet that passed him from life to death.</text>

            <text syncTime="4581.680" offset="18430098">I mean it's perhaps a little bit more in detail there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4591.697" offset="18470118">Well, may I go there and ahead, I'll try to reach that in further detail as we go on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4603.395" offset="18516929">Now, this -- this man Leon Williams when he took the young Baptist minister and drove him to a secluded spot or had him to drive to this spot some eight or 10 miles from the City of Muskogee and took him out and shot him down, we got that information from this man.</text>
            <text syncTime="4635.733" offset="18646288">He was later apprehended.</text>
            <text syncTime="4638.398" offset="18656946">However, after he had performed some more of his acts in disregard of law, he -- he drove from this point of death there in the Baptist minister's old mobile convertible.</text>
            <text syncTime="4661.207" offset="18748165">He drove up farther, I believe it was Talihina, a little Indian town there, that's on beyond Muskogee, on a general direction toward the Arkansas line.</text>
            <text syncTime="4676.194" offset="18808142">He seemed to know, very acquainted around Talihina, he got there, I don't know just what hour in the day time, but he took this trusty pistol and pulled another, hijacked him in the little town of Talihina, when he held up a fellow that he had worked for as I understand it and charged $1000 for dropping in on him with a pistol.</text>
            <text syncTime="4707.321" offset="18932694">Then he -- I believe the officers got after him around -- I think the record will show that, that they got after him, that he abandoned this car of the young preacher's and took to the woods, that's a heavily wooded section, Southeast Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="4726.934" offset="19011062">And that he finally came out of the woods on foot and worked his way into the town of Wilburton, Oklahoma, which is a county seat in a rural county just maybe 40 miles from the Arkansas line.</text>
            <text syncTime="4742.833" offset="19074696">He paid somebody $30 to take him from the brush where he'd been hiding to Wilburton.</text>
            <text syncTime="4755.768" offset="19126418">At Wilburton he boarded a bus, a commercial bus for -- bound for Fort Smith, Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4765.773" offset="19166438">And actually the officers were not far behind.</text>
            <text syncTime="4770.343" offset="19184724">It was on that bus, on his way eastward out of Oklahoma toward Arkansas, that he was placed under arrest by state highwaymen.</text>
            <text syncTime="4781.376" offset="19228923">State highway patrolmen arrested him and it wasn't -- but a very short time until he voluntarily agreed to go back with the officers to the Muskogee Country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4793.202" offset="19276152">He stopped on the way and showed them where he had hid his .38 pistol and of course the .38 pistol was found in the body of this young minister, Tommy Cooke, was found, and the statements was made by this young man.</text>
            <text syncTime="4814.761" offset="19362461">He -- he of course was lodged in the Muskogee County Jail as I understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4824.062" offset="19399659">The record apparently shows that and he was charged with murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="4830.218" offset="19424214">And it's -- the record would show that he pled not guilty first and that he stood for trial that I believe the jury was impaneled and sworn and at the trial of Leon Williams here on a charge of murder proceeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="4856.246" offset="19528391">And during this trial that something happened, where he decided to change his plea perhaps as it might be said in the middle of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4870.934" offset="19587114">He changed his plea from not guilty to guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4875.303" offset="19604564">And of course the judge as understood it, the judge, the jury and -- and probably with a wait of two days accepted his plea of guilty to the charge of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="4895.195" offset="19684185">And the district judge there, Judge E. J. Carroll upon the arrival of the day for sentencing did sentence Leon Williams in the District Court at Muskogee, that is the first time now that he had been charged and stood trial on this (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="4921.743" offset="19790346">He was given by Judge Carroll a sentence of life in a state penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4933.371" offset="19836844">And then he was sent to McAlester in accordance with that sentence and then stalled in the penitentiary, and authorities of Tulsa County did not know the machinery by which they got control of this prisoner, but I know they did, I don't know that but I don't know what -- from a Mr.-- my friend here Mr. Ladner would know all about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4965.539" offset="19965576">Anyhow, the man was turned over to Tulsa County and it was then that the young County Attorney of Tulsa County began to get acquainted with this fellow Leon Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="4981.499" offset="20029419">The attorney there, the County Attorney filed two charges against him as a result of this 48 hours trips that we just took with him awhile ago, which started out with hijacking in the filling station and then would later on kidnapping the young Baptist preacher and taking him out of the county and killing him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5004.253" offset="20120430">Well, the County Attorney filed the charges against this man, Williams, after they recovered the -- had gotten hold of him in the county jail at Tulsa.</text>
            <text syncTime="5017.266" offset="20172466">The County Attorney filed a hijacking or robbery charge against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5022.175" offset="20192110">That is where he has robbed the all night station, took $30 of the young fellow and threatened to blow his head off so he didn't stay in the -- this filling station until he got away.</text>
            <text syncTime="5035.424" offset="20245086">Any how the other charge was the kidnapping charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="5039.683" offset="20262118">Now bear in mind, if Your Honors please, in the mean time when this kidnapping charge was filed the murder charge had already been filed at Muskogee and he had been given life for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5054.192" offset="20320110">But nevertheless County Attorney still -- had filed a kidnapping and they went ahead and Williams thought it over I presume maybe talked to his lawyers, there are two public defenders I believe that's right maybe in Tulsa County.</text>
            <text syncTime="5075.578" offset="20405687">And Mr. Fred Woods is one and the gentleman far here is the other one.</text>
            <text syncTime="5081.305" offset="20428570">Anyhow, that for some reason which was sufficient and to himself, as Leon Williams entered pleas of guilty both to the $30 midnight filling station hijacking and to the kidnapping charge of taking the young Baptist minister.</text>
            <text syncTime="5102.442" offset="20513102">He had before entering those pleas had -- had an opportunity to confer and had conferred with the public defenders office?</text>

            <text syncTime="5150.339" offset="20704737">(Inaudible) studies this case a great deal longer than I have but I'll kind of stay in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5158.553" offset="20737546">All right, on the 30th of January these -- this man entered pleas of guilty to kidnapping and to robbery with firearms, both of them capital offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="5172.732" offset="20794284">The man and this round that we have gone on, occupying some 48, some 60 hours to 72 hours, he had committed three capital crimes, murder, kidnapping, robbery with firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="5193.277" offset="20876518">And having pled guilty to the last two, the authorities at Tulsa began to move in on him and he was given a time for sentencing, I don't recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="5214.421" offset="20961050">The Court was very liberal and very thoughtful about it and gave him several days.</text>
            <text syncTime="5221.016" offset="20987486">And in the mean time, the statement which is really one of bones of contention in this lawsuit and which is -- appears in full in the record, beginning at page 10 as I have it and going perhaps page 19 -- 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="5252.054" offset="21111620">Now that is the controversy of the statement and the Court would bear in mind that with the murder -- with the murder penalty already assessed, interwoven as it was with and as a climax to the kidnapping that here comes this subject of kidnapping on.</text>
            <text syncTime="5274.004" offset="21199391">And the County Attorney after the plea of guilty was permitted by the district judge to read a rather lengthy statement that the County Attorney had typed and which the man Williams agreed to tell the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="5295.189" offset="21284133">And so this statement here by the County Attorney is very truthful.</text>
            <text syncTime="5305.201" offset="21324152">I mean, it goes into the many records of the happenings of the moment, current happenings and it also, if Your Honors please, takes up what we lawyers call and officers of the law call, the rap sheet of an individual of poor reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5331.392" offset="21428955">He has a rap sheet and the rap sheet is the record of his convictions about over the country in the various courts and the organizations in Washington, the FBI, are very good bookkeepers on keeping these rap sheets current.</text>
            <text syncTime="5351.036" offset="21507532">And so, with permission of the Court, I want to show what the evidence shows that constitutes the record of this young man in which the young man himself verifies that this is the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="5369.658" offset="21582033">Mr. Edmondson by the way, I believe the Court understands that since January 12th, he's incidentally been the new Governor of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="5378.571" offset="21617664">He was the County Attorney at this trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="5564.212" offset="22360168">Now, if Your Honors please, I think we might pay some little attention to the Edmondson statement by hitting two or three of the high points.</text>
            <text syncTime="5593.890" offset="22478973">The record, page 11 -- page 11, I shall not read but 10,11,12, and 13 go into specific detail, all admitted by this petitioner as being true to the effect that he has participated in the activities I have gone over.</text>
            <text syncTime="5648.795" offset="22698506">Now -- actually, Judge Webb, Judge Webb was the District -- trial district judge at Tulsa who accepted the two pleas of guilty on kidnapping and the hijacking case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5681.938" offset="22831104">Judge Webb was very technically careful and the record will show and there will be no contest on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5690.977" offset="22867257">To make it clear that he wanted this -- this defendant to be assured of his extra time that he would be allowed to think this over before he entered the plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="5705.607" offset="22925772">And the judge of his own volition after the plea was entered with full warning and knowledge of his rights, the judge granted him an additional two days extra before he imposed the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5722.156" offset="22992018">And then went ahead and with the receipt of the seven or eight page statement from the County Attorney proceeded to pronounce sentence of death for the kidnapping which of course began on the streets of Tulsa and wound up in the lonely field area about -- via Muskogee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5749.270" offset="23100479">He was just given death for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5753.929" offset="23119078">The County Attorney made this long statement and actually Mr. Woodson who was the other public defender along with Mr. Ladner was -- was active in this case in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5770.243" offset="23184384">And Mr. Woodson objected to some of the statements of the County Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="5775.555" offset="23205595">And in the light of the fact that they were going into angles that -- all Mr. Woodson said had already been covered by the filing of a charge of murder and the sentencing of the man to life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5793.638" offset="23277902">Anyhow these -- these case were -- were interwoven.</text>
            <text syncTime="5798.319" offset="23296606">The Tulsa kidnapping case was completely interwoven with the murder case at Muskogee, in that the murder case was the final act, the end of the road of kidnapping.</text>
            <text syncTime="5818.819" offset="23378631">Now, it's our contention that both Judge Webb who was the District Court Judge at Tulsa and Judge Carroll our very experienced judges and that they like all other state district judges in Oklahoma, had a right which has become a tradition in Oklahoma for judges who are called upon to sentence men who have pled guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5853.513" offset="23517393">Our judges traditionally understand and our people understand that a judge had the right to call upon the prosecutors or the sheriff or anybody else that who is an officer of the Court there who might know something about this man or this party whose plea of guilty has just been received.</text>
            <text syncTime="5877.935" offset="23615091">It's standard operating procedure in Oklahoma for judges to want to know something about the nature and character and the type of person who had just pled guilty to a violation of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5895.314" offset="23684577">And so, Mr. Woodson made no outcry at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5902.009" offset="23711431">He -- he was representing Leon Williams when this seven or eight page statement of the County Attorney was read.</text>
            <text syncTime="5909.706" offset="23742151">He did object to some of the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5912.488" offset="23753331">He finally agreed that some of them were -- that he thought were all right or he agreed at least to proceed, I have them marked here where Mr. Woodson on one occasion said -- it's on page 11 of the record, counsel for Edwards said, all right to the Court who was hearing the County Attorney's statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5939.459" offset="23861164">He -- they didn't oppose this thing with a vigor that lasted all through the hearing and culminated with a motion, at the conclusion of this hearing which he had a right to make, if he'd wanted to make it, a motion to strike the County Attorney's statement from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5959.699" offset="23942144">Now, in the -- he understand the custom there that judges are supposed to have enough balance to take statements from the County Attorneys of our State and then to use them appropriately in pronouncing a sensible and logical, and just sentence on a plea of guilty.</text>

            <text syncTime="6013.061" offset="24155617">The basic argument, as I understand it, is that where the depravation of a constitutional right lies in this case is that the State of Oklahoma not satisfied with the fact that this petitioner was sentenced to only life imprisonment for murder the first time, in fact and in effect went after him a second time, with vengeance determined upon seeing to it that he be sentenced to death, that's the basic argument that he makes in his brief, not that -- that it was improper for the sentencing judge to consider surrounding circumstances, because obviously it's not.</text>

            <text syncTime="6073.824" offset="24398660">It is supported by the record to a certain extent and that is that there was some considerable information given the judge at Tulsa about the murder case over at Muskogee, not a great deal, but they were some in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6094.841" offset="24482774">But the fact that here the State comes up with malevolent purpose and design and says we're going after him again.</text>

            <text syncTime="6422.870" offset="25794853">May I first just to express commendation of Mr. Ladner as a public prosecutor -- a public defender in Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="6433.758" offset="25838425">He had absolutely no duty to perform after the trial in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6440.752" offset="25866428">And yet he and Mr. Woodson brought the matter to the Criminal Court of Appeals and then he brought on up here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6446.798" offset="25890565">It certainly is a shining proof of the fact that in Oklahoma at least, our public defenders are uninfluenced by the fact that they are employed and paid by the State and that they don't have any official duty after the trial in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6462.166" offset="25952005">We are proud of our public defender type.</text>
            <text syncTime="6465.675" offset="25966111">May I first answer a question that's been asked with reference to the venue in this case on what could have been done in Muskogee County and Tulsa County?</text>
            <text syncTime="6476.700" offset="26010206">This defendant could have been prosecuted for kidnapping in Muskogee County, because according to our statute, the venue, in kidnapping cases is wherever the kidnapping originated, where he was taken or in any county through which he is carried, or in any county into which he is brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="6500.239" offset="26104351">So that there were -- both counties would have had jurisdiction and the county which tried him first on the subject would have ended the possibility of prosecuting him for the kidnapping.</text>
            <text syncTime="6510.765" offset="26146461">If he had been charged with that in Muskogee County and they tried him on it, that would have been the end of any jurisdiction in Tulsa County.</text>
            <text syncTime="6519.844" offset="26182719">So far as the murder was concerned however Muskogee County was the only one that did have venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="6525.737" offset="26206333">That occurred in Muskogee County.</text>
            <text syncTime="6528.300" offset="26216573">Tulsa County could not have prosecuted him for murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="6533.917" offset="26239039">In the kidnapping charge, there is no reference to the murder, no reference to the death of the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="6542.803" offset="26274565">We have two kidnapping statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6545.737" offset="26286268">One of them applies where the kidnapping is simply for the purpose of detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="6553.730" offset="26318242">The other, this one, applies where the kidnapping is for the purpose of extortion; money, property, or thing of value or advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="6569.668" offset="26382085">It has been held to include a kidnapping for the purpose of rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="6576.884" offset="26410924">It might be held to include also the purpose of kidnapping for taking a man's life.</text>

            <text syncTime="6596.904" offset="26490964">And the one of the crimes that was immediately committed in further -- pursuant to that kidnapping was his robbery of his victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="6608.454" offset="26537148">Now, that was charged in Tulsa County and there isn't any contention here that the fact that he was charged with and pled guilty with the crime of robbery in Tulsa County was any bar to his prosecution for the kidnapping.</text>
            <text syncTime="6623.930" offset="26599111">And if the principle for which they contend were true then he couldn't have been prosecuted for both the kidnapping and robbery in Tulsa County for one would have been barred with the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="6637.084" offset="26651669">Now, in our own opinion in this case, I'm using a typewritten copy and I can't give you the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="6661.023" offset="26747486">It is further urged, the crime of kidnapping merged into the crime of murder, now in that connection there, I call attention to a parallel -- I can't present you a case where a man was charged and tried both for kidnapping and for murder, this isn't in -- the one I present to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="6683.975" offset="26839228">But we do have parallels in principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="6690.461" offset="26865246">For instance, the conspiracy statute, a man is charged with conspiracy and he may also be charged with and convicted of the things that are done pursuant to the conspiracy because the Court has held that they are separate and distinct crimes and our Court did it in Burns case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6709.591" offset="26941733">They're not the same and that one does not merge in the other and that a man maybe prosecuted for both.</text>
            <text syncTime="6718.543" offset="26977573">In this particular instance, the Court says it has further urged the crime of kidnapping merged into the crime of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="6725.377" offset="27004844">Neither of these contentions are talking about two others have been made just about it.</text>
