            <label>Mr. J. Ward O'Neill</label>
            <text syncTime="18.451" offset="177194">Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.868" offset="194853">Just to outline a fact for this case of death, this action was originally started in the Southern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.734" offset="222333">But they're unable to get -- we're unable to join.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.188" offset="236126">The employer of this man is a third party in New York so we had the case removed to New Jersey where it was eventually tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.536" offset="265488">The facts giving rise to the action are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.497" offset="277400">The Tungus is a dry cargo vessel, but in number three hatch, she has two deep tanks which are used apparently for carrying of oil or for dry cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.393" offset="320972">To that in the Philippine Islands and while there, a cargo of coconut oil was gotten.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.633" offset="345945">And in accordance with the custom of the trade, it was carrying under what's known as a coconut oil contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.129" offset="371858">Now, that contract among other things contain these provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.923" offset="387114">The shipper of the oil was to load the cargo, supervised the cargo, and pay for the loading of the cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.921" offset="415013">By the same token, the consignee in this country had the same obligation, namely, to supervise the unloading of the cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.286" offset="452524">Now, when the vessel came to New York -- I might say too that that contract was incorporated in the bill of lading so that became part of the contract of carriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.370" offset="492857">When the vessel arrived in New York, she discharged general cargo in Brooklyn.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.043" offset="511561">And while there, she received order to proceed to the El Dorado Oil Plant in Bayonne, New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.777" offset="538520">She arrived there about 5 o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.935" offset="551163">Right after her arrival, the El Dorado people who had received this contract from the owners of the oil not only to discharge it but to store it, have made arrangements for Mr. Skovgaard, the decedent, to examine and prepare an electric pump for the discharge of this oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.655" offset="622007">Under his guidance, one of the repairman placed this oil on a pallet or skid and took it down for the string piece on the dock.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.716" offset="658265">After the vessel's arrival, a Mr. Sexton, an El Dorado supervisor, came aboard the vessel, examined the oil, took samples, and not being satisfied that the oil was pure, ordered the discharge to commence.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.315" offset="716675">Now, after the vessel tied up the crew as customary after 5 o'clock were on the shore with the exception of two men and an officer, were always on guard on the vessel to watch the lines on tidal waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.323" offset="772681">El Dorado didn't have anybody to run the winches so the two crewman ran the winches.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.695" offset="794102">Before doing that, they went down, that is the El Dorado people, went down in this tank.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.363" offset="816776">It's about nine feet long and about three feet wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.590" offset="829733">And they took the lid off that tank and turned it at a 90-degree angle leaving about one-third of the tank open.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.539" offset="861497">They then brought on the electric pump and placed it on the tank lid with the suction part towards this hole.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.602" offset="893785">Now, every part of this pump, the hoses, the air injection lines, every part of it belong to El Dorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.331" offset="924714">They supplied electricity from the shore to run the pump, and they had a man there sets just where he wanted the pump placed.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.594" offset="957733">The pump was placed in that position and an answer to interrogatory, it was admitted that this pump was such and it required a man alongside the pump at all times.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.822" offset="998693">About 9 o'clock that night, the officer on watch checking his lines and walking around the deck looked down and saw that the pump was smoking.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.026" offset="1031502">Not knowing anything about the pump, it was necessary for him to run ashore, which he did, brought an El Dorado man on board who fixed the pump.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.063" offset="1067656">Pumping continued then that was relieved for about 11 o'clock, a man by the name of Russell (ph) pump man who came aboard.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.370" offset="1092838">About 12:15, just after midnight, the third officer was taken over.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.376" offset="1116871">They watched, looked down and saw that this pump was leaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.676" offset="1134111">And then they say at this point, it was leaking to what they call a nipple.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.916" offset="1151039">And that simply means sort of an attachment on the pump where they attached an air hose to get suction.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.943" offset="1175176">And this nipple was an ethical part of the pump.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.721" offset="1186252">It was created by El Dorado people from their own shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.250" offset="1216345">Now, again, the crew was in a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.254" offset="1228361">And not knowing anything about this pump not even knowing how to turn it off.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.337" offset="1244766">Again, we had a rundown to get somebody from the dock.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.235" offset="1256364">And by the time he came back, there were several tons of oils went into -- between the deck.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.454" offset="1277158">Well, the officer came out, they went down, they found that this oil had leaked down on other cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.372" offset="1300877">And that resulted in an argument to dismiss the suction because we asked them to admit and it is his responsibility and he refused to sign any papers stating that the (Inaudible) and he couldn't see.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.093" offset="1347793">On the mean time, El Dorado had sent two people down to repair this pump.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.448" offset="1369213">They came to shore with the loose nipple, they sit down and they tried to get suction, they couldn't get suction.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.137" offset="1391888">They then called up the decedent who was at his home, told him of what happened and he came aboard while there was an argument going on on the deck between the chief officer and Mr. Sexton.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.836" offset="1434728">The chief officer offered Mr. Sexton who had made an entry in the log to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.004" offset="1455417">That you can sawdust or sand if you wanted to put on this oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.294" offset="1472554">Mr. Sexton said that conversation wasn't solved but his testimony was that he was in complete charge of this oil, he looked down after the tank he intended to salvage the oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.011" offset="1515395">And he looked into the tank and for what he could see, his men who were down there repairing the pump by cleaning the sufficient area.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.381" offset="1544861">So that it was unnecessary to sufficiently clean as he saw it.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.946" offset="1559176">And of course, the oil could not be salvaged if it were contaminated in any way by the sand or anything else that might have been put on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.931" offset="1603062">And Mr. Skovgaard came aboard, stood up on the deck, looked down into the hall, and gave orders to these two men who were working on the hatch.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.546" offset="1633573">He walked around up above and eventually he went down into the hatch.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.823" offset="1650709">He stood up, went into the -- the pump, walked around through this oil it was spread all over and up and tried to step on the tank cover and in so doing slipped and fell to his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.660" offset="1698043">I may say at this point that this particular pump, the ship knew nothing about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.345" offset="1716746">We had no part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.355" offset="1720822">We knew nothing about it and the only man who seems to know anything about that pump was a Mr. Blaney.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.964" offset="1743182">Mr. Blaney was chief superintendent.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.971" offset="1751228">He came aboard immediately after the accident and then all he had to do is lower the pump and the pump worked and discharge continued the next morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.184" offset="1788113">Now, fortunately, the law in this case we had the situation of having all the witnesses live and testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.950" offset="1819146">And Judge Modarelli had to take the advantage of their testimony as well as watching them verbally testify in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.401" offset="1848926">And on all the evidence he held, that there was no duty here on the part of the ship to this man and dismissed -- dismissed the libel.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.781" offset="1886542">In part, he relied on a decision of the New Jersey court that is the Workmen's Compensation Bureau, who went through this hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.761" offset="1926457">And they decided that this man was entitled to his compensation under the New Jersey Act because he was in the twilight zone and was really not working for the ship, rather was working for the people at shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.230" offset="1980270">Now, in that connection I might say, sir that we have two causes of action on this case under the New Jersey Death Act one for negligence and one for unseaworthiness, and two causes of action under the survival statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.201" offset="2060204">I submit sir at the very time that this libel was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.824" offset="2074624">The -- the appellant had in mind that there was no such thing as recovering except under the survival statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.052" offset="2103568">But on the trial as I explained the death of this man, there was nothing left under the survival statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.995" offset="2127391">He was practically dead when he fell into the tank.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.182" offset="2140139">The effect cause has been abandoned and then we went to the Jersey Death Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.904" offset="2158947">Now, in their brief, they tried to give the impression as not only a death statute -- statute, it's survival statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.294" offset="2188518">And I submit it is not the -- Congress didn't intend it to be such because when Congress passed, the Death on the High Seas Act, they specifically said -- I refer to page 17 of my main brief, "After giving a cause of action, a death of a person shall be caused by wrongful act, neglect or default occurring on the high seas beyond a marine league from shore."</text>
            <text syncTime="547.959" offset="2295202">Now, the second provision was, the provisons of any State giving or regulating rights of action for remedy for death shall not be affected by this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.375" offset="2332923">Now, the statute of New Jersey that is a similar statute, the statutes of New Jersey has never been interpreted for the maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.820" offset="2362702">But in similar statutes, they've always held that rather it was a limitng statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.302" offset="2384541">In other words, you come up to the point if the man had a cause of action himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.039" offset="2403558">But that's the Jersey legislature didn't intend that that be a survival statute or to give any more than the Jersey law gave.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.618" offset="2433860">They then filled in the gap by giving a right of action to a -- to a survivor.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.710" offset="2454235">That is that that cause of action which he haven't solved for pain and suffering, medical expenses and other expenses in that line.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.386" offset="2484955">I'd also submit, sir, there's two that if we look at this statute, suppose that there were two men, left the El Dorado plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.235" offset="2520273">Two men went down because the holes would leak where the oil went in to the tank on shore and the other man sent aboard the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.143" offset="2551933">I don't think it can be said that the New Jersey legislature intended in 1846 that there'd be two separate causes of action for its citizen, because I don't think there's any question about the fact the man would fall into the tank, he would only have -- have his rights that this man had them under the state act, he would have recovered his compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.105" offset="2635839">Now, on the other hand, this other man, he goes on the ship and he derives his right under the decisions of this Court from a seaman.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.507" offset="2673351">He is a seaman.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.007" offset="2679411">But if he were a true seaman, he would have no cause of action in this case for unseaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.429" offset="2705115">His -- his cause of action for unseaworthiness would die with his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.279" offset="2720475">And yet, this man stands in his shoes and his right claiming under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.168" offset="2760077">Now, Mr. Baker and I assumed it will be followed up.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.690" offset="2778154">Makes more to the fact about the case being brought in admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.517" offset="2793409">But I think cases in this Court are uniform in holding that admiralty, and I cite them at page 20 of my brief, Western Fuel versus Garcia and Just versus Chambers.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.401" offset="2845027">In one, Western Fuel case we say, "Admiralty courts move in to obtain a libel in personam for damages sustained."</text>
            <text syncTime="693.692" offset="2878151">And the others they say, they won't force a wrongful death act.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.692" offset="2894137">And admiralty does no more and provide the forum, it doesn't provide any rights under the admiralty law.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.795" offset="2922559">It's just the forum that admiralty law provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.725" offset="2954324">Now, in the -- in the courts below, we might say it was agreed, all eight judges agreed that New Jersey's death statute was the only statute involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.005" offset="3023391">And under that statute, of course, Judge Modarelli held no duty with respect toward conditions growing out of the nature of the work that the man was doing at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.472" offset="3073233">Maybe I should save a few minutes or --</text>

            <text syncTime="766.157" offset="3168005">In this particular case, I don't think there's any question, but that the petitioners' officers and crew were on board all during this period and that they participated in the operations which were involved in getting the pump on board.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.156" offset="3231953">They conducted inspections, they discovered the leak, they called the Mr. Sexton who was the employee of El Dorado on board, when the condition existed and shortly exercised control of everything that went on, on their vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.553" offset="3317635">So that, I don't think there can be any issue in this case on the undisputed fact, but that the -- they remained in full control of every part of their vessel during this entire time.</text>

            <text syncTime="836.037" offset="3447515">And I might mention it here so that I won't take it up in my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.096" offset="3467786">In this case, Skovgaard was as analogous to Hawn as any individual could be short to being strained on the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.172" offset="3500074">Because if you recall in the Hawn case, Hawn was -- ships carpenter or a carpenter repairmen who was called on board to adjust some grain fittings that were used in connection with unloading or loading some grain.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.701" offset="3558170">Now, in this particular case, here is oil that's being unloaded and they called him on board to get the pump started again so that they can discharge the oil from the vessel.So this is a completely analogous situation for the Hawn case.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.498" offset="3613341">Now, in this state of facts, the -- there's no question, but that the ship's officers knew of the condition of the deck at least an hour before this accident happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.042" offset="3655555">As a matter of fact, it's -- it was their factual contention that all they had to do was to tell the -- the El Dorado foreman, Skovgaard, that he should clean up the mess.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.504" offset="3701426">That that, it was -- their only responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.601" offset="3709785">But they admit it, appears in the log, it appears in the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.803" offset="3722533">They admit that they knew of this condition, they admit that it was a dangerous condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.212" offset="3744266">They suggested that sawdust and sand be put over this oil in order to prevent the hazard and as a matter of fact after the accident happened, the testimony is that when the El Dorado crew returned, there was sawdust put on the deck and the inferences, it was done by the crew and that the crew was actually putting up some lines around the open tank.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.576" offset="3849697">The deceased's injury in this case did not stem from a condition he was called upon to correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.211" offset="3888253">Now, we mentioned that fact because that was the point at which the trial judge stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.326" offset="3912704">The trial judge did not make findings of facts relative to negligence, relative to unseaworthiness, relative to comparative or contributory negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.152" offset="3959933">All he said in the case was that he felt it was not the duty, and that's the legal duty, of the vessel to clean up this acknowledged dangerous condition and he relied upon the Broecker case in New Jersey which I will discuss shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.646" offset="4037987">Judge Modarelli said, “Here, Skovgaard boarded the vessel to help repair the defect and restore to operation the pump which caused the oil spill," and that's the only that could be considered a finding of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.194" offset="4084172">He does not say that he was called on board to clean up this condition, to remove the oil on the deck, or to take any safety measures with reference to this oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.333" offset="4124714">He was called from his home after two other men had tried to get the pump to operate and acouldn't for the specific purpose of getting the pump back in operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.681" offset="4178108">I also would like to call attention to the fact that there was testimony that the two men who had been working on the pump had partially squeegee using some kind of a device, some of the oil from the deck.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.877" offset="4226905">I also call the Court's attention to the fact that unmistakably, since there's some mention of it in the dissenting opinion that the deceased here is entitled to a presumption that he exercised due care and certainly, in view of the fact that he -- when he came on the scene, two men were working in the area, it's not unreasonable to say that he, as a matter of law, assumed the risk of -- of the dangerous condition that would have been created by the oil spill on the deck.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.814" offset="4342680">Now those, I think are the important facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.860" offset="4350830">The other important fact is, of course, that the man fell into the tank of hot oil and as a result of it, died leaving a widow and children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.479" offset="4397328">Now, our contentions in this case are, first, that the deceased, if he had lived, would have been entitled under the general maritime law to a cause of action for negligence, to a cause of action for unseaworthiness, and that the rule of comparative negligence would have been applied to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.028" offset="4487502">And we have already adverted to the fact that he was analogous to Hawn so I won't develop that point any further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.426" offset="4521044">On the next point, our contention is, that the general maritime law both as to unseaworthiness and negligence and as to the defenses to be applied is the law to be applied in this case and we arrived at this result on two -- through two routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.471" offset="4613308">And I'd like to discuss one route first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.316" offset="4640684">The first route is by an interpretation of the New Jersey Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.815" offset="4662627">Now, we all recognize the historical situation that has arisen in the case of wrongful death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.020" offset="4691466">It's caused a great deal of trouble both in common law jurisdictions and an admiralty jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.376" offset="4712887">For some reason, the common law was unable to visualize a cause of action in terms of the laws of next of kin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.422" offset="4749040">In other words, that common law, the common law was unable to recognize that the next of kin, a wife and children, suffer damage from a negligent tort committed, say to a husband.And so, the common law failed to provide a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.998" offset="4811316">This was the reason that Lord Campbell's Act came into existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.336" offset="4828766">For some reason, this doctrine had sinked over into maritime law and we have the statement that has been quoted and that appears that maritime law as such does not, from its own sources, provide a remedy for wrongful death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.964" offset="4899192">And I think that the -- the thing that has caused the -- the Court's great trouble in fashioning a common law rule as -- as the courts or -- or a maritime law rule as the courts have done in -- with respect to business and by piece and other types of liability that have developed through the years has been that, there seems to be no model for determining who shall take, who has this right and how much they shouldn't get -- shall get.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.485" offset="4997308">And as Judge -- Mr. Justice Frankfurter has pointed out, the various states have enacted these wrongful death statutes and there is some variation as to who may recover and how much and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.541" offset="5045582">Now, the New Jersey statute is modeled after Lord Campbell's Act which is the English statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.607" offset="5073795">And we must start out by looking at the New Jersey statute and the interpretation of the New Jersey statute by the New Jersey courts.That's our starting point on our first leg.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.515" offset="5109426">And this is the case -- on -- on this approach, I can distinguish every other case and every other jurisdiction because I can say to Your Honors, I don't know how the courts have interpreted their statutes in Tennessee or in Florida or in Ohio, each State would have to be -- each statute would have to be interpreted in the light of its own state court decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.448" offset="5197197">I can only discuss the interpretation in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.505" offset="5217364">Now, it's clear under the New Jersey decisions that the courts in New Jersey regard the action as to liability as derivative, as to liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.501" offset="5261354">It's a new cause of action in the sense that it creates a right for somebody who didn't have it before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.341" offset="5288730">But -- and -- and one case I think it's a good example of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.438" offset="5301164">There's one case in New Jersey where there, the Court applied the two-year statute of limitations which does not appear in the Wrongful Death Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.427" offset="5337109">The Wrongful Death Act says, "You must start an action within two years, if you don't, you automatic -- two years from the date of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.597" offset="5365739">If you don't, you automatically loose your right to a cause of action."</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.764" offset="5378382">In addition, there's a general statute which requires that suits be instituted for personal injury within two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.015" offset="5407431">Now, on this particular case, the deceased had been injured and had lived for more than two years and had not instituted the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.095" offset="5439718">Then the party came along, the next of kin came along and they attempted to institute suit on the Wrongful Death Act and the state personal injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.688" offset="5482141">The two-year claim was pleaded as a defense on the ground that at the time that the deceased died, he no longer had a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.964" offset="5511189">And the Court said, "That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.486" offset="5517354">You can only sue if the deceased had a cause of action at the time he died."</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.200" offset="5540133">He lost it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.699" offset="5546193">Because at the time he died, the two-year statute, the general two-year statute had applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.853" offset="5570748">Now, I quoted several of these decisions in my brief and I won't avert to all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.288" offset="5600528">As far back as 1896, Chief Justice Beasley said, first -- the first question is, could the deceased, if he had survived, have maintained the action?</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.872" offset="5638875">That's the first question under the New Jersey Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.003" offset="5659355">And here, we have a situation where at least, since the case of Hawn versus Pope &amp; Talbot, the test of whether the deceased could have maintained his action is the general maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.088" offset="5711705">So that the New Jersey Act, by this reference language, refers to New Jersey law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.913" offset="5747022">And this is reasonable, this is sensible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.790" offset="5754546">We do the same thing in the case of Landlord and Tenancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.940" offset="5771160">This Act was not designed to specifically lay down each and every ground of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.295" offset="5792580">This was simply designed to cure a defect, namely, to -- to say, "Who shall receive money, who shall have a right and how much they shall receive?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.272" offset="5828420">But in all other respects, I submit, that the New Jersey statute, in terms of liability is coextensive with the liability rights of the deceased if he had lived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.259" offset="5876381">In addition to that, the New Jersey courts have said again and again, the New Jersey statute is in the highest sense remedial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.726" offset="5906265">It's intended to correct the defect in the law.It should be liberally and broadly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.239" offset="5928312">It shouldn't be narrowly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.977" offset="5935313">And I quoted from cases on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.348" offset="5952763">Now, as Judge -- Judge Hand said in the Halecki case, it would be incongruous to say that the New Jersey legislature would intend to give the widow less rights and liability than the deceased would have had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.717" offset="6014203">In other words, if you sue on the survival or if the deceased have lived, the rule of comparative negligence, for example, would apply to the fullest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.327" offset="6052655">But if he dies, we're going to make a construction of this statute and say, “Well, we're going to be harder on you than the general maritime law even though you weren't at fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.205" offset="6088182">We're going to say that you're going to have to apply the contributory negligence rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.279" offset="6104482">"I say that the only fair construction of the New Jersey statute is that it's a referral statute and that it incorporates the general maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.340" offset="6136769">And for this reason, if this action was -- were started in the state court on this analysis, the state court would say, “We will have to look to the rights of the deceased if he had lived and we would apply the general maritime law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.266" offset="6204479">Now, the second question that comes up under the interpretation of this Act is whether the words "wrongful act, neglect or default" includes an action for seaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.636" offset="6257873">That's already been passed on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.277" offset="6264456">I don't want to repeat it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.113" offset="6283786">Mr. Justice Brennan, who iss sitting in this Court, wrote an opinion in the Jensen case indicating that the phrases could be broadly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.060" offset="6319626">I also note that Judge Lumbard who dissented in the Halecki case had this question come up very recently in -- in the (Inaudible) case in interpreting the New Jersey statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.419" offset="6369050">The New Jersey statute of limitations uses the phrase “wrongful, neglect or default”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.924" offset="6391097">And the New Jersey courts have generally construed that any personal injury case where the rising out of contract or tort -- in other words, including breach of warranty or -- would be governed or would -- be governed by this particular phrase “wrongful act, neglect, or default”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.416" offset="6473017">And as a result of that in the (Inaudible) case, it was construed that an action based on unseaworthiness was barred by analogy under the New Jersey statute of limitations because of the broad scope of this phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.851" offset="6526725">And of course, Judge Lumbard cited and referred to the Halecki and Skovgaard decisions which are the two prior cases on this point.</text>

            <text syncTime="1617.035" offset="6571551">As a matter of fact, the day I was reading proof in the Halecki, I got the copy from the printer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.174" offset="6596106">And it came out just at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.550" offset="6605615">I have also cited Judge Walsh's opinion which was affirmed which was the District Court opinion which is cited in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.387" offset="6644903">Page 23, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.407" offset="6652949">Now, aside from the interpretation in the New Jersey law, I have cited cases, we have cited cases in the brief showing that certainly, New York State in the Greco case has -- has extended this language of wrongful act, neglect and default to include an action for breach of warranty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.979" offset="6739257">And some of the language, particularly the quotation from Justice Cardozo, I think, is very appropriate, in which he says that the purpose and the policy of the courts is to -- is give life to these statutes, not to kill them by strict construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.517" offset="6809475">And that these statutes themselves are source of new law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.726" offset="6822327">And I think that answers part of the argument that -- how could a New Jersey legislature back in 18 something have visualized unseaworthiness coming under this particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.591" offset="6865690">I say the New Jersey legislature didn't have to visualize because it doesn't enumerate what the grounds are for recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.440" offset="6893171">It -- it deliberately takes a referral position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.178" offset="6908113">It -- it goes to the rights under such as if the deceased had lived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.264" offset="6924413">And because of that, I think that any fair construction of that statute comes to this result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.499" offset="6957328">Now, in the -- on the issue of contributory negligence, there is another tact which I would like to raise and bring for the Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.813" offset="6998601">Let us assume that the New Jersey statute specifically say, "Contributory negligence shall be barred to this action."</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.768" offset="7034441">Now, I call the Court's attention to the fact it does not so state and I -- I submit to the Court that the only reason contributory negligence is a bar in New Jersey is because it is a bar to the -- to the deceased if he had lived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.788" offset="7094523">Now, let's assume we come to New Jersey or perhaps another state where there is this positive rule in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.606" offset="7121795">There's no question about it that the intent is to cover everything including martime cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.863" offset="7146872">In that situation, I think we come back to fundamentals which were adverted before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.190" offset="7168084">The maritime law has a void here which it's supplying by adopting the State Wrongful Death Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.995" offset="7199326">The maritime law as I understand it, grows in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.661" offset="7214059">It's -- it's analogous to the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.725" offset="7226284">One is by assimilation of common law doctrines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.782" offset="7242480">I think the business invitee doctrine is coming to maritime law by assimilation from common for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.894" offset="7270902">The other is when you get a situation like this where the maritime law hasn't a provision where it has a kind of a vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.765" offset="7310399">It will permit the state law to come in and for the specific type of cases, and which cases which occurred in New Jersey will adopt that statute and say, “It applies here.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.468" offset="7353240">Now, in the maritime law, there is a strong positive rule against contributory negligence, or to put in another way, there's a strong positive rule of comparative negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.939" offset="7395140">This is an affirmative doctrine of maritime law and one that I think maritime law is justly proud of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.634" offset="7425860">And again, in the Hawn case, there is strong language indicating that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.814" offset="7446653">And I think they refer to the contributory negligence rule as being a discredited rule if I recall correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.038" offset="7475493">Now, when the New Jersey Act comes up assuming it did have the specific provision, I think that this is a situation where the maritime law can say, “We have a strong positive rule which we consider superior to the state rule.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.117" offset="7539858">And since this is being adopted into the fabric of maritime law where we have a strong positive rule, we will not adopt the state rule, we will insist that our own rule be followed for the purpose of uniformity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2151.062" offset="8707636">And the Broecker case stands for the proposition that if a man is called to repair a hole in the floor, he can't complain that a place where the hole in the floor is an unsafe place to work.</text>

            <text syncTime="2188.044" offset="8855594">And the distinction has been followed in the (Inaudible) case, I think Judge Wright wrote a -- a very clear opinion on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.621" offset="8893837">In that case, which Mr. Baker has adverted to, the man was called on board to repair a broken -- a rusted pipe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.242" offset="8928319">And in order to do so, he -- which was in a confined place, they rigged up some kind of very clumsy scaffolding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.582" offset="8961651">And while he was doing that, the rusty pipe, I believe, gave way and he fell off the scaffolding and was injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.039" offset="8991535">And the judge's opinion said, the rusty pipe does not -- is not an unseaworthy condition, he was called to repair this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.247" offset="9028315">But the scaffolding was an unsafe place to work and it rendered the vessel unseaworthy and gave him recovery on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.790" offset="9062484">Judge Goodrich in the (Inaudible) case and we've cited all these in our brief, has pointed out this distinction and has said that the Bruszewski case is one that is very narrow and is to be strictly confined to that type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.200" offset="9132178">I might even add on the New Jersey in the Berquist case which is cited in our brief, Judge Goldman indicated that the Broecker case also is a case that is to be interpreted strictly in terms of the precise point it's raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.811" offset="9198634">Now, in this case, there is no question, not in the judge's opinion, not in the facts that are in the record, that it was not the duty of Mr. Skovgaard to clean up the oil on the deck.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.309" offset="9240639">He was called from home for the specific purpose of getting the pump back in operating order.</text>

            <text syncTime="2311.464" offset="9349204">Then there's no liability on the part of that owner to warn him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.575" offset="9365713">Now, we have the additional fact in this case to that forgetting about Mr. Sexton refusing to correct that, and as fellow employees trying to correct it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.912" offset="9399045">We have the additional fact that at the end of this loading, these men were going down into that tank, go down this ladder that had been submerged in the oil all the way from the Philippines to scrape it off the sides and get it -- and wallow in it to get near the -- the muzzle of the hose so they could get it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.727" offset="9474278">And the fact of the matter is that when this man fell, they did go down in that tank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.806" offset="9494549">Now, here, the crew on the ship, here, they had men aboard whom they knew at some stage of the proceeding were going down after this oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.318" offset="9528613">And that was one of the reasons that the lower court held and under New Jersey law, there was no obligation to warn a man of the condition that was perfectly obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.828" offset="9566647">Now, contributory negligence wasn't in this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.741" offset="9582320">As a matter of fact, the case was tried before the District Court on a theory of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.664" offset="9602069">I don't see where unseaworthiness came into this case of the reply brief in the Circuit Courts, tried it on a -- on a question of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.511" offset="9637386">Now, we say, sir, there's no -- no need to send this back because if this Court agrees or the judges below thought the libel should be dismissed that this Court agrees with those four judges on that point, there would be no need to send it back for new trial.</text>
