            <label>Mr. John F. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="35.871" offset="246888">Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.633" offset="277922">The issue here is whether a sum of money owed by a bankrupt restaurant to the trustees of a union welfare fund, whether these sums of money are wages due to workmen within the terms of the Bankruptcy Act so that they will be entitled to a priority of payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.001" offset="399339">If these sums due to the welfare fund are to be considered as wages due to workmen, then they are entitled to a priority to be paid immediately after the expenses of administering the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.930" offset="471124">If on the other hand they are not wages, then they will share with the other secured creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.659" offset="513964">Now, the Embassy Restaurant in Philadelphia had contracted to pay to the trustees of the welfare plans for the local unions, which represented their chefs, theirs cooks and the local union representing the waiters and waitresses, the sum of $8 a month for each union employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.620" offset="625873">This obligation arose from a collective bargaining agreement which had been entered into between the Greater Philadelphia Restaurant Operators, Inc., representing the restaurants generally, and the Local Joint Executive Board of Philadelphia which was made up of the unions of the workers who worked in the restaurants and the hotels.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.619" offset="725870">And the purpose of these -- the purpose of these payments and it's set forth, page 30 of the record, and this is quoted from the collective bargaining agreement under (b) and this is all what is stated about the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.983" offset="799326">“These funds shall be maintained and utilized to promote life insurance, weekly sick benefits, hospital and surgical benefits and other benefits for the employees who are members of locals,” and it names them, “in the employee of the employer as in that practice.”</text>
            <text syncTime="201.020" offset="907473">Now, the funds were to be operated -- were to be used in accordance with a trust agreement which is also set forth in the record at pages 9 to -- 9 to 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.059" offset="995558">The restaurants are not a direct party to these trust agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.436" offset="1009142">The trust agreement entered into by the local union, in this case, the chefs and cooks union, and the Board of Trustees for the welfare fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.635" offset="1057938">And this is the document under which the recipients of these payments from the -- from the restaurant were to be governed in -- in the administration of their trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.619" offset="1109870">This, too, is stated in the most general terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.775" offset="1126484">I call the attention of the Court to the provision on page 11, which names the purpose of the trust and to Article II, Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.185" offset="1164100">It says, “The purposes of the chefs, cooks, pastry cooks and assistants' local union -- Local 111 welfare plan shall be provide welfare benefits for employee who use -- who meet the eligibility requirements for coverage as such eligible -- eligibility requirements presently exist or are amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.778" offset="1258454">Almost a cut blank but they don't define welfare benefits other than just welfare benefits as such.And then, in the duties of the trustees, the trustees are given authority to determine how these funds shall be used.”</text>
            <text syncTime="305.651" offset="1325955">And Article IV on page 13 states -- gives these trustees the -- the authority to make the determination as to what welfare purposes they shall be used for.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.784" offset="1378513">It's one of the item in the -- in the trust agreement and that is with respect to the rights, the beneficial rights of the union members.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.966" offset="1419264">On page 22, this was specifically stated, “The money is to be paid in the said Local 111 welfare plan shall not constitute or be deemed moneys due to the individual employees.</text>

            <label>Mr. John F. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="347.921" offset="1495019">Page 22 of the record, Mr. Justice Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.787" offset="1534516">Now these, I think, are -- are all the facts which we have before us in -- in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.653" offset="1561997">And the question which we have to answer is whether this $8 per employee, which was not paid, is to be considered wages within the provisions of 64 (a) of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.465" offset="1633259">The language of that section is not helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.632" offset="1645902">It merely says that there shall be a priority for wages due to workmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.830" offset="1670666">Legislative history of that section is also, as far as any reference to congressional debates or reports, is also not helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.770" offset="1710477">The words have been in the statute in these words since about 1841, although there have been some changes in the details.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.285" offset="1748511">But as far as interpretation goes, it's always just referred to wages to employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.695" offset="1778186">So far as judicial interpretations of this section are concerned, there is a split between the Second Circuit which in a case named Local 140 against Hack in 242 F.2d, decided that these funds were not wages on facts which are very close to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.210" offset="1884244">And the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in the -- in this very case which recognize the conflict and came to the office with result.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.256" offset="1920397">There are several District Court opinions in New York, in New Jersey and in Southern California.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.157" offset="1951953">New York and New Jersey going one way, California the other, and these opinions are divided on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.721" offset="1982255">I find them unusually -- unusually helpful in -- in analyzing the question, they're good opinions and they raised the issues very close -- very, very carefully.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.166" offset="2024051">As far as this Court is concerned, the closest that this Court has come to this question, I think, is in United States against Carter in 353 U.S. 210.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.930" offset="2079117">You did not have before you at that time priorities under the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.394" offset="2096985">You had a question as to whether a bond given to secure a payment in connection with construction of federal buildings, a bond which secured amounts justly to the persons for labor, would include an obligation to pay funds to a welfare plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.756" offset="2190399">And the Court in deciding that the bond did cover those payments, was specific in saying that it covered more than wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.135" offset="2227911">And that even though these particular payments were designated as not being wages, they were still covered by the bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.194" offset="2260198">So that the case, insofar as it has any application, is not -- is not inconsistent with the position which we take here.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.212" offset="2304188">I think that it is note -- noteworthy that in other statutes, however, payments to welfare funds are generally not treated as wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.370" offset="2348805">Thus, they are not taxable to the employee under the Income Tax Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.422" offset="2373047">They're not taxable to the employee under the Social Security taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.338" offset="2396766">Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, payments made to welfare funds are not considered to be part of the regular wages which would be doubled for over time.</text>

            <text syncTime="622.119" offset="2591848">There's -- as far as I know, there's no judicial decision on that but it's -- that's the way it's been administered throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.407" offset="2617031">I mean similarly, under the Walsh-Healey Act, it's been administered by the Department of Labor where there is a provision for the payment of prevailing minimum wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.608" offset="2653811">That too has been always interpreted as not including welfare benefits within the term prevailing wages.</text>

            <text syncTime="1669.681" offset="6782098">I think that the first and essential consideration and problem which we must face in this case is a definition of the term “wages” as it appears to the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.963" offset="6827238">Congress has never defined this term in this Bankruptcy Act but has left it to the definition of courts for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.161" offset="6864018">And courts have consistently, beginning back in 1903, defined the term as meaning compensation for services rendered, reward for labor performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.338" offset="6916681">And this is the meaning which is attached and described to the term wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.603" offset="6937788">And I think it's critically important that it be considered in this fashion in the context of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.196" offset="6960149">Because, the term wages, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out, has been an ambulatory one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.532" offset="6985540">It's expanded tremendously as are industrial economy has expanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.013" offset="7003408">Then there's various and new types of compensation have been developed in the field of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.797" offset="7026604">Vacation pay , severance pays, sick leave pay, holiday pay and numerous kinds of fringe benefits all exist and are all today considered by our Court's to be wages for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.652" offset="7078013">It's well settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.664" offset="7081984">For example, as vacation pay is wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.250" offset="7096404">As Mr. Justice Brennan pointed out, it's deferred wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.090" offset="7107688">The courts have said, the Third Circuit said in the early Public Ledger case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.991" offset="7123362">And I think that concept of compensation of reward for labor performed is one which is inherit in the definition of the term wages as it appears in the Bankruptcy Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1804.938" offset="7323146">But I think we must consider how this contribution, as welfare contribution arises here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.333" offset="7344671">It arises from the product of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.682" offset="7358151">It's due to the welfare fund as a result of the compensation and as part of the compensation due to employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.253" offset="7388348">In normal situation, an employer and a union sit down to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.365" offset="7408828">Union makes numerous demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.908" offset="7414993">The employees want 20 cents an hour increase and they want a welfare fund contribution and they want more vacation pay and they want additional holidays.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.051" offset="7451564">And as the parties gradually meet and counter proposals are made and they merge toward a middle ground where there's going to be a meeting in their minds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.736" offset="7478314">The employer says to himself, “I have so much money to spend for a two-year agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.914" offset="7499003">I can afford to pay 20 cents an hour for labor fees for two years.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.269" offset="7520423">And he in effect, says to the union, “You do what -- what you want with this amount.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.541" offset="7537560">You can take 8 cents in wages this year and 5 cents next year and somewhat 2 cents which will cover increase vacation cost and 5 cents to a welfare fund or have it anyway you please within certain limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.105" offset="7591790">If you want to take 10 cents this year and 5 cents to welfare fund, that's up to you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.700" offset="7610180">But the union and the employees of course and the union acting as collective bargaining agent for the employees decide that they want so much money in welfare fund contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.270" offset="7652498">If they want 5 cents an hour or in this case $2 a week or $8 a month to go to the welfare fund, and this is a part of their compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.394" offset="7688965">This is the part of the reward for the labor that they performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.043" offset="7703594">Just as if they put this 5 cents an hour in their pocket as part of their wages, is added to their hourly rate of pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.575" offset="7733687">So they take 5 cents and had -- and asked the employer to give it directly to the welfare fund as part of the compensation for the labor that they performed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2379.231" offset="9620250">But it seems to me that where the Bankruptcy Act talks about wages due to workmen and that with the term wages, while certainly it means compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.134" offset="9667897">I think it means in terms of employer cost for labor performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.934" offset="9687124">Now, the Internal Revenue Code which Mr. Davis mentioned and a number of other taxing statutes all specifically accept wages from the definition of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.810" offset="9730591">And we contend that this doesn't show that these contributions are not -- weigh also specifically accept -- excuse me -- welfare fund contributions from the definition of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.208" offset="9768208">So that an employee is not taxed for the benefit that he receives by virtue of the employer contribution to the welfare fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.774" offset="9806451">Now, this shows it seems to us, number one, a recognition by Congress that where the exception not made, this welfare fund contributions would be income, would be wages to the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.688" offset="9874160">But the need for a specific exception from the definition of income shows that -- shows the Congressional recognition of the fact that otherwise, they would be interpreted to be wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.338" offset="9912717">And in fact, the -- the congressional purpose of benefiting welfare funds by encouraging contributions is to be found in this exception in the Internal Revenue Code, the Social Security Act nor the other taxing statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.002" offset="9971336">And if we take this 5 cents which I mentioned before and pay it directly to the employee and have him assign it to the welfare fund or have it -- have him assign it to the insurance company or to the welfare fund where the Government says, “This is entitled a priority,” he there has to pay taxes on that money because it's paid to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.129" offset="10047927">But if it's paid directly by the employer to the welfare fund there is no tax on it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2500.300" offset="10104560">Well, by analogy perhaps except in the recent welfare fund and Pension Fund Disclosure Act which was passed and approved last August, the legislative history of that statute shows without a doubt that Congress recognized that welfare fund contributions are part of the compensation to employees that they are part of the wages which employees earned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.770" offset="10194422">And they're earned by employees by virtue of their labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.548" offset="10209573">Now, I cited the -- the Senate Committee reports in our brief and there's no sense repeating them here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.517" offset="10237471">I would like to call the Court's attention to the Carter case which we think is most important and in which we think the analysis and the rationale of the Court clearly points the way to defining these welfare fund contributions as wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.078" offset="10307688">In the Carter case, there was a collective bargaining relationship obligating the employer to make a welfare fund contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.384" offset="10336946">And the Miller Act under which that case arose provided that a contractor who engages in construction work for the Government must file a bond guaranteeing to labor and material men, all sums justly due to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.051" offset="10403610">Now, the employer did not make his welfare fund contributions and the trustees of the welfare fund brought suit against the bonding company, against the surety, saying that you're responsible for this welfare fund contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.557" offset="10461602">And the bonding company defended on the ground that these aren't sums justly to the employees who performed the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.919" offset="10495039">And the both -- this Court reversed both the District Court and the Court of Appeals and said that the trustees in the welfare fund stand in the shoes of the employees who performed labor to receive these contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.701" offset="10558151">And the trustees to the welfare fund have the right to collect these benefits because they are in a sense, although perhaps not the formal or technical assignees to the employees, they are -- they stand in the shoes of the -- the exact phrased used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.537" offset="10621471">And they -- the - -the trustees, the welfare fund have as much right to receive these benefits as the employees did to receive their wages in cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.371" offset="10660864">Now, I believe that contrary to the Government's position, the original purpose of the wage priority is fulfilled by granting a priority to these welfare fund contriubutions because the very purpose of these contributions is to give protection to the employee against illness, accident, hospitalization, not only of himself but also of his family in a time when he most needs it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.535" offset="10769533">Because certainly, when illness strikes at times -- at time of unemployment, that certainly is when the benefit is most needed and there is a direct benefit to the employee, because of the contribution.</text>

            <text syncTime="2725.766" offset="11006412">Well there's no question about it because the eligibility rules of the welfare fund may -- may make the determination in the receipt of benefits dependent upon the receipt of contributions for so many hours of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.717" offset="11054268">And if those contributions aren't received, an employee may not be eligible to receive benefits unless if they aren't granted a priority, he may not be entitled to the funds which the welfare fund would pay him in case of accident, illness, hospitalization and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.989" offset="11115290">And -- and this Court recognized that fact in the Carter case where in a footnote it's pointed out, that eligibility may depend upon receipt of contributions for certain number of hours work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.263" offset="11168475">So that essentially and basically, the position of the welfare funds here is that the contributions are part of the collective bargaining package.</text>
