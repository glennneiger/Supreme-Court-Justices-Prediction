            <label>Mr. Ray H. Lafky</label>
            <text syncTime="14.927" offset="163088">This case is but another facet of workmen's compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.435" offset="181164">And in my 14 years of legal adviser to the Oregon Commission, I have gradually adjusted and adapted myself to the philosophy of the liberal construction of the law which must accorded all workmen's compensation actions to the growing field, the judicial expansion of the “twilight zone” which was enunciated in the Davis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.784" offset="274474">There were more recent cases where the conflict comes between various state jurisdictions where this Court has permitted actions in both States.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.066" offset="303626">And I think the “twilight zone” is certainly a proper judicial expansion of the philosophy of workmen's compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.698" offset="346154">Now, actually, as we compare, for I want to oversimplify the Longshore Act and the Workmen's Compensation Act of Oregon, each of them require a certainty of compensation in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.694" offset="398190">And if the employer fails to provide that certainty of compensation, the alternative of a negligence action is provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.838" offset="426715">Let us assume that the factual reverse, that the action was under the Longshore Act and he had failed to provide his workmen under the benefits under the Longshore Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.173" offset="476035">Then, if action were commenced there, could they say, “No, you have a definite right over into the workmen's compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.215" offset="504247">And also, you can't have a damage action.”</text>
            <text syncTime="101.920" offset="511039">I think that that maybe an oversimplification.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.328" offset="524727">I -- I did wish to answer Judge Stewart's question in -- under the Oregon law, an employer must bring all of his employees in a given occupation under -- he may have separate occupations and have one under and the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="129.514" offset="621380">He could have, at any time withdrawn it and then his workmen would've been entitled to the compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.617" offset="645831">Now, if we were to deal on hypothesis and what can happen, there are two cases cited in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.715" offset="674252">One of which is Hess against the United States which have been cited by the respondent, 259 F. 2d 285.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.813" offset="706644">That case involved six workmen on the face of Bonneville Dam who were preparing to repair the floodings and faces of the dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.877" offset="750843">They set out from the Oregon shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.626" offset="757844">They got too close to the spillway, five of them were drowned.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.580" offset="777697">No question was raised by the Oregon Commission as to the maritime coverage on this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.232" offset="804342">The employer was shore based, he was out there working on a fix structure but there was a barge, there was an instrument of navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.721" offset="830255">There was some delay of the question of whether Oregon or Washington should take.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.104" offset="847809">I mention this case not because of the law involve but because of the factual situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.096" offset="871737">That employer had lost his financial surety in the contract with the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.515" offset="897442">He had state compensation with both Washington and Oregon, but he had a very minimal policy to protect him against any possibility of maritime injury like possibly applied to the skipper of a tug who was drowned, but he was very dubious if it would apply to any of the other carpenters and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.749" offset="978317">Now, what situation that we have there?</text>
            <text syncTime="221.840" offset="990751">If those workmen had proceeded against that employer, they would have a right but no effective remedy certain.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.690" offset="1018128">The Oregon Commission voluntarily accepted those four fails probably, I think, $1000 are better in liability of the state fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.785" offset="1050520">The Oregon Supreme Court is correct in its very narrow assertion that merely because navigable water are concerned to state laws of jurisdiction and that's just about as far as they went, I have ill-advised my client to the extent of $100,000 in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.770" offset="1122408">And in another case mentioned in the briefs, King against the Accident Commission mentioned in the petitioner's brief, 309 P. 2d 159.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.271" offset="1160443">There were five workmen drowned on Elsie Bay, the tidewater and the river, navigable waters involved workmen out in a -- in a boat who were repairing a broom, protecting logs, preparatory to having these logs moved up in navigable waters of the Elsie River.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.938" offset="1227107">So there are nine fatals along numerous dependent children left without fathers.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.796" offset="1254588">And my interpretation of the Davis case would lead me to believe that in both cases, they were “twilight zone” injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.248" offset="1280397">Both cases, I -- it is not in the record but I know of known personal knowledge that there was no longshore insurance provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.695" offset="1310177">And certainly, in this broad scope, I think that looking at the interest of the workmen and as I stand here now, actually, when I say this I -- I am referring to the liability in the State of Oregon and the state fund for these things but I think that that is a proper field of activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.525" offset="1377468">And you do have the other facet here too and that is -- well, I have no direct interest with Mr. Hahn, I don't even know the gentleman.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.067" offset="1411636">I see in these arguments here the question of the standard of care and -- and respondent here feels that the -- this employer should not be subjected to a higher standard of care.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.982" offset="1455313">No injured workman can ever be made whole again.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.308" offset="1464613">We can't put him back together again.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.836" offset="1470673">All you can do is set up a yardstick to measure damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.083" offset="1487705">But certainly, decision should be geared and tempered so that employers are required to maintain the highest standard of care to workmen because we may not put Mr. Hahn back together again but by insisting upon a high standard of care, we may prevent some other workmen from being injured and I think that that is --</text>

            <text syncTime="395.892" offset="1686967">He himself has deliberately rejected state compensation, exposed himself to this damage action by virtue of that voluntary election on his part.</text>

            <text syncTime="543.046" offset="2275558">Mr. -- Mr. Justices, I feel compelled at the outset to make some remarks which I think would be irrelevant except for the contentions of the petitioner in this case, and that is the inference or the direct statement that the defendant here, Ross Island Sand &amp; Gravel did not carry state workmen's compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.594" offset="2369703">The statement of the Attorney General of the State of Oregon was as I said on the briefs here that the State Industrial Accident Commission is the only entity authorized by law to provide workmen's insurance as such in Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.031" offset="2431457">We pointed out in our brief here from the Chairman's report of the Oregon State Workmen's Compensation Law that there is private workmen's compensation in Oregon and that the Chairman's report went on to say that the safer employers carried private workmen's compensation instead of compensation with the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.838" offset="2514735">Now, in our -- what I think is rather peculiar set up, the state industrial accident fund is the only official -- officially recognized source of workmen's compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.535" offset="2557471">And any employer who rejects the state act and carries his own private compensation either with private carriers or self insured, he lays himself open to negligence suits or suits under our Oregon Employers' Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.309" offset="2612642">But as the report of the State of Oregon here points out, employers who reject the State Workmen's Compensation Act still continue to carry workmen's compensation either in private carriers or self insured.</text>

            <text syncTime="1358.309" offset="5536580">If I may ask the Court's indulgence to go into the history of this matter very briefly, I think it may be of some benefit in understanding the problem at least as the respondent sees it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.567" offset="5597602">This Court, if I may go back, the grant of admiralty power, and I use power rather than jurisdiction, is found of course in the -- the judicial article of the Constitution regards to all cases involving admiralty and maritime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.848" offset="5662804">It's also found in the grant of power concerning commerce between the States and among foreign countries and also among the -- the grant of all other powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.618" offset="5705853">Now, it -- it was not until Southern Pacific versus Jensen in 1917 that the conflict between the States and the Federal Government came to focus on this particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.468" offset="5765204">And looking at Jensen just a moment, not in regard to compensation laws but generally, the two dissenting justices are the two justices that wrote the dissents in the Jensen case, those were Justices Holmes and -- and Mr. Justice Pitney, both were the opinion in 1917 that in state courts, the State was free to apply state laws and did not have to apply any admiralty laws if -- even if the event happened on navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.749" offset="5878366">The majority in that case held, and again, I'm leading out compensation laws, the majority in that case held that anything concerning navigable water, anything concerning maritime that there -- the Federal Government was supreme in that regard and that because of this supremacy, the State Workmen's Compensation Law of New York could not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.070" offset="5959659">Now, the Jensen decision, as the members of this Court are so well aware, has certainly been blunted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.459" offset="5981184">However, this Court repeatedly reiterates in its decisions the fact that in matters of maritime, the Federal Government is supreme and state law cannot be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.727" offset="6030294">Now, as the Court so well knows, this matter was wilt at the way after Southern Pacific versus Jensen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.982" offset="6059342">And courts, this Court as well as other courts held that even though it did occur on navigable waters, in the particular instance of workmen's compensation that the Federal Government was not necessarily supreme simply because the injury or death happened to occur on navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.464" offset="6133217">And then the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Act was passed which of course gave the -- or was a federal statute covering injuries on navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.615" offset="6173863">Even after the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Act, this Court as well as other courts said, “Well, even though it happened on navigable waters, still for various reasons, State Compensation Acts could apply."</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.516" offset="6217435">Then, because an injured workman, it was getting impossible to tell where his remedy was.Was it in the state or was it federal?The same thing was true of employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.284" offset="6256515">So, this Court in the Davis case in 1942, in an effort to solve this problem of which compensation act applied, solve it for the employees benefit and for the employers benefit instead of leaving the line as Congress drew it under the -- drew it under Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Act set up a zone.And said in this zone, either state workmen's compensation or federal workmen's compensation is possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.246" offset="6360377">Now, the Court, I don't think, attempted to say that that was a legally logical answer but it did point out that it did solve a very definite problem in supplying compensation benefits to employees and at the same time giving some benefit to their employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.797" offset="6430595">Now, if the respondent understands the Davis case, the thread that the respondent sees in that case is if the only Act which would bring this under maritime and admiralty jurisdiction is the fact that it happened on navigable waters, if that's the only thing, then there's nothing wrong with defying State Workmen's Compensation Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.191" offset="6528188">On the other hand, if there is something else in addition to the fact that it happened on navigable waters, if there is something else, then the Davis case cannot apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="1639.647" offset="6661935">But I -- I've gotten this -- I thought I got this guidance from some other cases of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.622" offset="6685863">This Court has held in other cases where an injury occurred on -- on navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.852" offset="6710732">This Court has held the fact that it occurred upon navigable waters alone made it a maritime tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.640" offset="6733928">And this Court has said, if it's a maritime tort, there is federal supremacy and the Court cannot change the federal law in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.089" offset="6767679">Now, I'm referring particularly to three cases of the Court which I think have been within the last six, seven, eight years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.143" offset="6795995">The first case in point of time was the Garrett case, now, that was a seaman's case, true, but the question there was what -- was who had the burden of proof in proving the validity of a seaman's -- of a release taken from a seaman?</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.355" offset="6852838">Now, the Court in that case said, “This happened on navigable waters, also, of course, it was brought under the Jones Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.478" offset="6873318">But the Court stressed the fact that this was a maritime matter and therefore, the state law, on the burden of proof in a release, could not apply that it was necessary to apply the maritime law, that applied customarily in seaman's case that the employer had the burden of proof of proving that this release was taken free from any fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.529" offset="6949491">Then I think a more important case on this subject, more important than this particular regard not because of the nature of the case was Pope &amp; Talbot versus Hawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.571" offset="6985644">Now, in that case, a carpenter was onboard the ship, went onboard the ship to make some repairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.840" offset="7010722">Now, the ship was in Pennsylvania, in -- in a harbor in Pennsylvania, and the carpenter was injured by something alledgedly wrong with the ship and he sued the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.292" offset="7048547">Now, this was not a Jones Act case, he was a -- a ship repair man and was suing a ship for a -- I'll call it a maritime tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.662" offset="7081984">He brought the suit in the law side of the federal court or perhaps it was removed to the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.416" offset="7105076">In any event, it was on the law side in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.545" offset="7121586">This -- and the question before this Court, one of the questions was, “Will the Pennsylvania law of contributory negligence apply which would bar Mr. Hahn or will the general admiralty law of -- contributory negligence is merely a mitigation, will that apply?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.742" offset="7186369">Well, this Court held an unmistakable language that if the tort occurs on navigable waters, it's a maritime tort and the state law can have no application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.802" offset="7226598">It must be federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.553" offset="7237569">Then this Court in the last term, I believe it was in the McAllister case, when the question was when a seaman sued for both unseaworthiness and under the Jones Act and the question was, would the state statute of limitations on unseaworthiness, would it apply?</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.067" offset="7303607">If it did, the plaintiff would have been barred because it was brought after the two years, which I think was the Texas statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.767" offset="7326490">This Court again held that this having occurred on water was a maritime tort and the state law could have no application.</text>

            <text syncTime="2763.030" offset="11155519">State law here isn't trying to take away any admiralty rights and all the court said in those cases, as I understand it is that where state law conflicts with established admiralty rights or attempts to deprive a person of those rights that the federal law prevails.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.965" offset="11223228">Now, obviously, there is no conflict here because in the -- the Garrett case and the Davis case were both decided the same day, and the opinions were written by the same justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="2934.505" offset="11841390">There's nothing in the record on it that Mr. Hahn even knew about it or there was never offered to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.119" offset="11867826">And they set out in their brief a policy of workmen's -- a private policy of insurance, and I think the inference is or they want this Court to understand that that is their policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.150" offset="11928012">Now, this is completely outside the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.387" offset="11948910">Normally, I wouldn't mention it except the Court here seemed to be interested in it and I did point out in the brief, in our reply brief starting at page 10, to the end of the brief, how this private so-called policy of insurance is nothing like workmen's compensation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.790" offset="12018500">To begin with, it has no standing under the law whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.811" offset="12034591">And if the employer rejects the Compensation Act, they are held responsible under the law of negligence whether they have one of these policies or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.490" offset="12069282">It's a voluntary act on their part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.622" offset="12077850">Now, the quality of this insurance, this so-called compensation insurance is well illustrated by paragraph 16 of that insurance which provides that a simple agreement between the insurer and the employer will cut the injured employee off without one cent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.381" offset="12164890">In other words, all the -- all that has to be done is the insurer and the employer agrees that this fellow gets nothing and he gets nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.060" offset="12195610">Now, what a -- what a whip to require an employee to take a smaller inadequate award in a situation like that, all they have to do is agree he'll get nothing and he has no rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.768" offset="12242422">I think that answers the questions of one of the justices asked as to whether an action of law can be maintained against the insurer or the employer under one of these policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.275" offset="12288502">Furthermore, in order for the employee to get any rights at all, he must give a full release.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.867" offset="12310862">In other words, he has to sign a release to the insurance company before he's paid anything, that's Provision Number 14 (e) of this policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.426" offset="12345031">Now, if he asked to sign a release before he gets any benefits or before he is in entitled to anything, how can he bring an action under the policy?</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.800" offset="12374601">Obviously, he can't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.822" offset="12382647">The policy provides that it can be canceled by the insurer or the employer anytime on 10 days notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.035" offset="12403545">Of course, in Workmen's Compensation, under the Workmen's Compensation Law, he's entitled to it at all times and even if the employer has not complied with the Act by putting -- paying the premiums.</text>
