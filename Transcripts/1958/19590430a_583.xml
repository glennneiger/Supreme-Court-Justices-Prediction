            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 583, Henry Napue, Petitioner, versus People of the State of Illinois.</text>

            <text syncTime="23.067" offset="195688">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.913" offset="215019">This Court granted certiorari to review the judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois in which post-conviction relief was denied to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.925" offset="263084">The federal question is whether petitioner was denied due process of law in the Illinois criminal court because perjury was knowingly used in obtaining petitioner's conviction for the alleged crime of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.123" offset="327868">Petitioner is now serving a sentence of 199 years in the Illinois State Penitentiary pursuant to the state court conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.960" offset="367261">In its judgment to the opinion, the Supreme Court of Illinois held that there was perjury knowingly used in petitioner's prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.142" offset="411982">The facts arose in this fashion, if Your Honors please.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.769" offset="430477">In an indictment in the state court, the petitioner was prosecuted for a crime that was alleged to have been committed in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.205" offset="464227">The trial took place in 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.635" offset="477915">The principal witness against the petitioner was a man who previously had plead guilty under a separate indictment in which he was charged with the same murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.498" offset="525354">He was the only witness that the prosecution could rely upon because the other alleged eyewitnesses had moved away from Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.824" offset="562657">It is conceded by the prosecution in this particular case that without this man's testimony, the petitioner's conviction could not have been obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.297" offset="608528">The man's name was Hamer.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.941" offset="615111">He was bought back from the penitentiary on habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.204" offset="636217">On cross-examination, counsel for petitioner here, the defendant in the original prosecution, asked this witness whether or not he was testifying freely and voluntarily, and he said, "Yes," that he was.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.285" offset="704554">On redirect examination, the prosecutor asked this witness directly, “Has the judge,” naming the judge, “promised you any consideration for your sentence,” and there was a negative answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.967" offset="759202">And then he asked him, “Have I,” meaning himself, the prosecutor, “promised you any consideration?”</text>
            <text syncTime="169.682" offset="782085">And there was a negative answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.167" offset="788041">The witness was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.335" offset="800684">Some six years later, this prosecutor resigned from the Office of the State's Attorney of Cook County.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.323" offset="828688">And on his own, filed what in Illinois is called a coram nobis petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.921" offset="851048">At that time, the post-conviction law of Illinois had not been adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.890" offset="870902">It was supported by this prosecutor's affidavit in which he described in detail the agreement that had existed between him and this witness by which this witness promised that he would testify against the petitioner and furnish evidence which the prosecutor thought was indispensable to obtain his conviction in return for an expressed promise that he, the prosecutor, would recommend to the appropriate authorities the reduction of this witness' then 199-year sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.109" offset="991796">In fact, the prosecutor was so strong in his language that he characterized this agreement as a compact between this witness and the lawfully instituted authorities of the State of Illinois in return for his testimony against the petitioner, flatly contradicting the testimony of this principal witness at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.387" offset="1072880">The petitioner then obtained a copy of this coram nobis petition and this affidavit of this prosecutor and made it a part of his application for post-conviction review in the Illinois court.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.819" offset="1118647">There was a hearing held and relief was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.394" offset="1140903">There was a petition for writ of error to the Supreme Court of Illinois, and the Supreme Court affirmed, holding as a matter of fact that there was perjury and that it was knowingly used according to the dissenting opinion construing the majority opinion, five judges voting for affirmance and two judges dissenting including the Chief Justice of the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.427" offset="1221047">But the majority opinion went on the ground that this perjury, though it was used, somehow, the Supreme Court said, was explained to the jury by what they characterized as subsequent testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.400" offset="1281024">A reading of the record, as we point out in the brief, shows that when Hamer testified in direct answer to the questions put to him on redirect examination, there was no further testimony by Hamer, and there is no evidence of any other kind going to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.100" offset="1343822">The Supreme Court of Illinois seemed to adopt the doctrine which I'm not familiar but there is something ameliorating about revelation of perjury and we say, in our brief, we know of no -- no such doctrine that if perjury is explained to a jury, it doesn't amount to the infraction of the guaranties of due process which Your Honors have said.</text>

            <text syncTime="426.826" offset="1810683">Now, just where it was revealed, it doesn't appear as far as we can tell.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.639" offset="1821968">And our position is that the Supreme Court erred in this construction of the record that the perjury committed by him was never revealed because Hamer was discharged as soon as he made this answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.476" offset="1865226">I might say this in order to emphasize the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.880" offset="1882885">The gravamen of the injury here occurred on redirect examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.800" offset="1902529">Mr. Myers' affidavit clearly shows that he was very familiar with Hamer.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.789" offset="1930533">He had questioned Hamer at the time of the crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="462.315" offset="1952684">He then prosecuted Webb.</text>

            <text syncTime="468.690" offset="1978180">And I'd like to call Your Honors' attention to a fact, which is significant to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.015" offset="1995421">It is common practice in Illinois Criminal Law which I am familiar in these -- years at the bar, that where there are multiple defendant, the practice is to join them all in one indictment and charge them all as principles under our principal and accessory statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.391" offset="2060936">It is significant, it seems to me, that in this case, they indicted each of these alleged defendants separately, indicating to me and this record is assessable to this understanding that when Hamer was first arrested, he never mentioned Napue's name because if he had, they would have returned one indictment against Webb, Napue, Hamer and Poe.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.610" offset="2149857">And under our Illinois practice, they could -- they could prosecute them each seriatim as they were apprehended.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.381" offset="2176920">It is significant, it seems to me, in this record that each of them was indicted separately and prosecuted separately and in the record is shown the numbers of their respective indictment, indicating that when Hamer first spoke to -- to Myer, he did not tell Myer, who was the principal prosecutor, about the existence of Napue.</text>

            <text syncTime="703.550" offset="2917543">Now, I'd like to devote just a moment to the contentions of the respondent with regard to the brief filed by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.630" offset="2965922">The respondent relies in Hysler versus State of Florida which, we submit, is clearly distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.079" offset="2995702">In the Hysler case, what the Supreme Court of Florida said and which Your Honors upheld was that the coram nobis practice under Florida law complied with the requirements of due process, the provisions which Your Honors have said should be maintained in some State, in some form, by which post-convicting relief can be granted one who claims that his conviction denied him due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.724" offset="3118268">But Supreme Court of Florida held plainly that on Hysler's application for coram nobis, he did not make out a case by which he could have obtained relief even if he proved the allegations of the petition and the case was peculiar on its facts because as Your Honors pointed out, Hysler had remained in jail for four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.637" offset="3221922">Then on the eve of the execution of one of his co-defendants, the co-defendant issued an affidavit exculpating Hysler.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.559" offset="3253582">Now, that case on its facts was difficult to handle like in (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="793.210" offset="3276257">But in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Black and two other Justices of this Court dissented holding that it was not a matter of testing the credibility of the affidavit at that state of proceeding but rather, if the allegations were such as to show a denial of due process, Hysler was entitled to a hearing which the denial of the application did not grant him.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.628" offset="3373850">But in this case, in our case, the Supreme Court of Illinois has found as a matter of its judgment that there was perjury here.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.928" offset="3403107">And I call Your Honor's attention to fact that in an earlier phase of the post-conviction proceeding, the petitioner here, Napue, had been denied a hearing and the record shows that he took a -- an application for writ of error to the Supreme Court of Illinois and the Supreme Court of Illinois remanded the denial of a hearing, and this appears on page 34 and 35 of this record, and found as a matter of fact that his allegations in the post-conviction petition entitled him to a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.788" offset="3538526">And this judgment of affirmance, denial of relief, came after the reversal in which the Supreme Court ruled on his earlier writ of error proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1107.878" offset="4534836">Your Honors, Mr. Leighton has made a fair statement of the case as he invariably does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.723" offset="4570258">However, it may assist the Court in his consideration of this case by stating the facts a little more elaborately than he did and I refer not only to the facts that he omitted that helped the State but facts that he omitted which, I think, may help the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.348" offset="4648730">The perspective of the facts is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.788" offset="4666493">On the day in 1938 in question, four men entered a cocktail lounge near the wee hours of the morning armed and undertook to execute a holdup.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.435" offset="4749145">An off-duty police officer, police officer off-duty by the name of O'Malley drew his gun and started shooting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.622" offset="4793866">Officer O'Malley was fatally wounded in the mallei, the affray and died some nine days later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.302" offset="4840573">Also slain in the affray was one of the robbers named Townsend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.122" offset="4871816">One of the participants in the robber was -- in the robbery was this witness Hamer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.142" offset="4903894">Two other men, one of whom Hamer identifies as petitioner Napue took Hamer out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.897" offset="4946944">Still a fifth man was at the wheel of a car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.645" offset="4965961">One man, Your Honors will recall, one of the robbers had been slain and was in the cocktail lounge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.662" offset="4989994">The policeman was mortally wounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.153" offset="5003995">These two men who were not hurt took Hamer who was badly wounded in the chest and the third man drove Hamer with them to a doctor's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.324" offset="5064704">Hamer was left at the doctor's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.654" offset="5074004">The doctor administered first aid, perhaps saved his life, and called the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.777" offset="5106500">Hamer confessed -- well, that isn't quite a fair statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.103" offset="5127816">Hamer admitted participating in the robbery but said at first that he was an involuntary participant, that the other men told him that they were going for an automobile ride that they stopped into the cocktail lounge, that he didn't know that any robbery was meditated and that somebody handed him a shotgun and said, “This is a stickup,” and that he wasn't an involuntary participant in the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.641" offset="5257906">He identified Poe, Webb and petitioner, Napue, as three of the other four participants in the robbery, the fourth being, of course, Townsend who had been slain in the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.771" offset="5338467">Poe was apprehended, tried, convicted, sentenced to death and has been executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.572" offset="5377651">Petitioner was apprehended some two years after the original occurrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.805" offset="5406595">It appears that he made a confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.386" offset="5424880">It does not appear that the confession was used in his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.477" offset="5453302">It appears that he reenacted the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.256" offset="5472423">It doesn't appear whether that reenactment was testified too at his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.316" offset="5504606">He was tried and on the trial, Hamer was brought from the penitentiary and testified against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.152" offset="5543999">I think with the Chief Justice's permission, so to be absolutely accurate, I would like to read some of the language in which perjury admittedly consists.</text>

            <text syncTime="1445.529" offset="5885471">Mr. Myers, the prosecuting attorney is interrogating Hamer and he asks, “Did anybody give you a reward or promise you a reward for testifying?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.344" offset="5932701">Answer, “There ain't nobody promised me anything,” after some material that neither the petitioner nor the State deem as important to print, Hamer is asked by Myers, “Directing your attention to that time and place in Statesville, did you tell Mr. Steinberg," one of Napue's attorneys, "that you were drunk that day?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.875" offset="6026846">"No, I didn't."</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.971" offset="6031235">I don't want to read all of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.689" offset="6050147">Hamer had pleaded guilty and been sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.886" offset="6082957">He testified that a man whom he thought to be an assistant public defender had promised to recommend leniency to the proper authorities if he would testify against his co-defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.890" offset="6162892">He said he thought the man was a public defender.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.304" offset="6188596">On redirect examination, he testified that the trial judge had promised him nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.027" offset="6215450">And the last question he was asked, “Have I,” that's Mr. Myers, the prosecuting attorney, “promised that I would recommend any reduction of sentence to anybody?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.128" offset="6267904">The answer is, “You did not.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.548" offset="6281592">Now, Myers deposed in his affidavit that in fact although him -- he, himself, elicited this testimony, "You have not made me any promise."</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.228" offset="6328299">He had promised the petitioner that if the other witnesses, the other participants corroborated Hamer's claim that he was an involuntary participant in the robbery, he would recommend a reduction in the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.105" offset="6419832">But the Supreme Court of Illinois said that petitioner could hardly have understood Hamer's promise to be other -- anything other than a categorical promise to recommend leniency if he would cooperate in testifying against his co-defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.767" offset="6526412">Now, the question that emerges from this record is this, Your Honors, and its foreknown which the Supreme Court of Illinois divided by two.</text>

            <text syncTime="1639.108" offset="6659845">Hamer's sentence was 199 years, as I recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.520" offset="6685445">Now, the question as phrased in our brief is, I think, carefully and accurately phrased.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.057" offset="6747617">We thus phrase it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.648" offset="6753991">Petitioner was convicted of murder upon inter alia the testimony of an accomplice who first denied then admitted that he had been promised the recommendation of leniency for his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.517" offset="6821491">However, the witness testified falsely as to the author of the promise of leniency, ascribing the promise to a man who may believe to be an assistant public defender when, in fact, the testimony -- the promise was that of the prosecuting attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.341" offset="6908740">The prosecuting attorney vowed safe to the Court no revelation of the falsity of the testimony and conviction ensued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.334" offset="6952730">The question is the trial court and the Supreme Court of Illinois held that the jury was surprised by Hamer that he had lied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.511" offset="7029426">They were not apprised, however, as to the author of the false testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.769" offset="7062444">The majority of the Supreme Court of Illinois concluded that in no reasonable likelihood could the identity of the author of the admitted promise of leniency have resulted in an acquittal or any lesser sentence in that meted to petitioner and held that there had been not any denial of that fairness which is of the essence of due process avowal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.406" offset="7204968">They affirmed the trial court's dismissal of petitioner's post-conviction proceeding, two justices dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.508" offset="7249377">Those are the facts and that is the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.154" offset="7267976">And I have very little to say other than to argue with -- in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.310" offset="7324609">The Supreme Court says in its opinion that it doesn't appear whether petitioner's confession was used against him or not, and it doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.702" offset="7370167">It does appear that no -- no writing signed by petitioner or allegedly signed by him was introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.395" offset="7404962">It does appear, however, that upon being apprehended, he readily admitted his guilt and reenacted, voluntarily reenacted the slaying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.042" offset="7463581">It doesn't appear that he testified in his own behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.384" offset="7476955">Of course, he didn't have to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.091" offset="7491688">The witness Hamer first said, “Nobody has promised me nothing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.360" offset="7520841">He later retracted that perjurious statement and said that in fact a promise of recommended lenity had been made but he lied about who made the promise, attributing it to an assistant public defender rather than to the prosecuting attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.583" offset="7625749">Now, the Supreme Court of Illinois respected the rule of Mooney against Holohan and sequent cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.385" offset="7688861">And it -- there's still the essence of its holding in this case in language that I should like to cite briefly, if I may have the Chief Justice's permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.044" offset="7747584">The Supreme Court of Illinois said, “Where a conviction is obtained by the -- a presentation of testimony known by the prosecuting authorities to be perjured, the constitutional requirement of due process is not satisfied," citing authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.116" offset="7851865">"To show a denial of due process within the meaning of this rule does not necessary that the false testimony be concerned directly with a question of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.770" offset="7890422">Even though it bears only upon the credibility of the witness, it may have the effect of depriving the accused of a fair trial."</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.520" offset="7921455">Then the Supreme Court adds immediately this sentence, “Whether such effect is present, depends, of course, upon the circumstances of the particular case."</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.219" offset="7964296">And the Supreme Court of Illinois held that the jury knew that Hamer had been promised something that he was testifying with an expectation of reward and that it couldn't, in any reasonable likelihood, have made any difference to the jury whether the author of the promise was a member of the staff of the public defender or of the staff of the prosecuting attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.344" offset="8092714">Two justices thought there was a vital difference between the two functionaries, the public defender and the prosecutor and the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.670" offset="8138062">That's the position of Illinois, Your Honors, that not that it was a burden that -- that -- once a man is shown as -- as petitioner did show that perjury has been knowingly suborned by prosecuting officials, it must fairly appear, affirmatively appear that the perjury couldn't, in any reasonable likelihood, have affected the result once it's known that perjury is committed even though there isn't a disclosure that the witness has correctly identified the man who made the promise.</text>

            <text syncTime="2419.738" offset="9782314">Mr. Leighton.</text>

            <label>Mr. George N. Leighton</label>
            <text syncTime="2420.990" offset="9787329">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.905" offset="9794957">I would like first to answer Justice Stewart's question about the fate of Hamer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.422" offset="9821080">When we appeared before the Supreme Court of Illinois, one of the arguments made by the State was that Hamer was still in prison under his 199 years sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.474" offset="9857233">I didn't want to sound facetious but I thought it's proper to observe that all that proved was they were unfair both to Hamer and to Napue that Hamer, they told me, he's still in the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.961" offset="9903208">Now, Mr. Wines make some point about the concessions and admissions by Napue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.336" offset="9944691">I don't sole read the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.944" offset="9959111">Hamer pled guilty to the crime in which he was charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.046" offset="9975515">This petitioner pled not guilty, submitted his case to a jury and the record here shows through the testimony of one of the police officers who testified in the post-conviction proceeding (Inaudible) that when he was present in court, Napue took the stand and testified and he heard Napue, the petitioner here, testifying in his own defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.390" offset="10060884">In the post-conviction proceeding here, Napue gave detailed testimony explaining how he happened to know Hamer and explained it quite diametrically opposed to the version which Hamer gave in his prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.471" offset="10117308">He explained that he was at home with his wife when Hamer came there in an automobile and someone told him that is rumor, Hamer had been wounded and he assisted this other person in helping Hamer because Hamer was sent to him to have been wounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.235" offset="10180315">And that's how he happened to know of the incident of Hamer being wounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.414" offset="10197034">So that his testimony, we must presume that his testimony in the post-conviction was the same testimony gave in his own defense at his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.723" offset="10238307">He -- he denied that he was a participant in this crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.584" offset="10249697">He pled not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.167" offset="10256071">He submitted his case to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.154" offset="10264012">And in his post-conviction case, he gave detailed denials of his participation in this crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.658" offset="10285955">And he claims in his testimony and in his affidavit that not only was Hamer aligned with regard to this promise, and his point is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.341" offset="10320750">That had Hamer testified truthfully, then his lawyer would have had the opportunity to have revealed to the jury that this man is giving this testimony not because he's telling the truth but because he's hoping that his 199 years would be reduced, and it's a very important principle of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.841" offset="10386787">In People versus Savvides, I think the best proof that I have or the best case that we can find in this country, and I concede that it was not a case construing the Fourteenth Amendment, it was the case in which the Court of Appeals of New York ruled that the duty of the prosecutor whose witnesses lie in the presence of the jury is to speak up immediately and tell the Court and jury, "My witness is lying."</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.442" offset="10497128">That's the duty of the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.295" offset="10504547">That's the tenor of a fair trial before one of our state courts or jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.367" offset="10520848">Otherwise, due process doesn't mean what we think it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.420" offset="10533073">And this petitioner said that when Hamer lied about a public defender and he knew Maury Myer from a public defender.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.813" offset="10566614">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.205" offset="10568182">Because he had seen Maury Myer in the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.669" offset="10578004">He knew that Maury Myer was not a public defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.068" offset="10587617">And Hamer was trued enough to know that by same public defendant, he was creating an impression, which was not only misleading but basically untrue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.149" offset="10623979">He gave the impression to that jury that a public defender who couldn't help him was -- made a promise of recommending leniency which he couldn't make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.651" offset="10653968">And the man who recommended -- who -- who told him that was the man who was standing before the jury, eliciting from him a false bit of testimony which, if revealed, would have lead the -- the way to the truth to being shown to that jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.115" offset="10703809">And inherent in this due process question is the duty of the prosecutor, an indispensable part of a trial and living up to the finest tradition of the bar when a witness of his tells a lie, to speak up promptly and reveal that fact to court and jury and accord to the man before the bench and bar a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.849" offset="10798791">Thank you.</text>
