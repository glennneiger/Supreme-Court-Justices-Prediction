            <text syncTime="27.203" offset="212198">This case was on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.428" offset="245112">Petitioner is a motor carrier holding operating authority from the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.212" offset="288266">It conducts operations of principally between defined areas in the States of Virginia and West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.248" offset="356394">The State Corporation Commission instituted proceedings against petitioner which led to fines totalling of $5000 for transporting shipments between two points in Virginia through Bluefield, West Virginia in accordance with its interstate certificate as construed by the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.454" offset="509158">There were a total of 17 counts specified in the rule to show cause before the State Corporation Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.665" offset="553984">And at the hearing, in the submission of briefs there, they convicted on a total of the seven counts omitting three that the Government later confessed thereon.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.497" offset="621380">So to summarize on that points -- on that point, Your Honors, there were 10 counts involving shipments moving from one point in Virginia to a second point in Virginia where the State authority has conceded that the operations were interstate in character.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.776" offset="722526">Now, I believe that if I can make reference to a map that I have here behind me.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.570" offset="761605">I may more quickly inform the Court on the facts and circumstances surrounding the growth or development of these interstate certificates and I earnestly state that an understanding of these facts, I believe, will make it easy for the Court to decide the question of law that's involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="293.250" offset="1276322">Now, with respect to this first certificate of petitioner, the Interstate Commerce Commission has consistently held that a -- the radial authority of this truck authorizes the whole of thereof to conduct operations between the radial base which would be the Bluefield area here on the one hand and on the other any or all points described in the outlying territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.516" offset="1377468">That is, that it could pick up a shipment at Roanoke and deliver it in Bluefield or pick up a shipment in Bluefield West Virginia and deliver it in Bristol or Whitfield or Charleston, West Virginia.</text>

            <text syncTime="343.992" offset="1479346">Later, I believe in 1943 Service Storage through a Section 5 application asking Interstate Commerce Commission to be permitted to acquire the authority previously issued to a gentleman by the name of (Inaudible) and he was the holder of authority described here in yellow that is between Bluefield, West Virginia enforced within five miles thereof and on -- on the one hand and on the other points in within 75 miles of this base area in Virginia and West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.572" offset="1649664">Now, pursuant to the provisions of Section 216 (a) of the Motor Carrier Act, prior to the time that these two individual carriers were merged in one carrier, they were permitted to interchange or interline the track just as railroads and for the regulated carriers are permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.125" offset="1759901">For example, a shipment could be picked up at Roanoke on the yellow certificate brought to the radial base which is the point in common to both certificates and then delimit, so to speak, on the blue certificate or pick up at Roanoke brought to Bluefield, West Virginia and deliver it at Charleston, West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.349" offset="1860733">Now, getting to the actual operations that were involved in this controversy, I have drawn in an attempt at simplification of the whole problem, some of the halving of operations that have been conducted historically since the certificates were merged but certainly as the record discloses for a period of more than four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.535" offset="1977553">They had the -- a collection of LTL shipments as they say in the trade, less-truckloads, small shipments averaging, in my case I believe, approximately 400 pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.775" offset="2046516">They would be consolidated at a terminal location at Roanoke, Virginia and move in line haul service or over the road service to the base territory Bluefield, West Virginia where the carrier has its principal terminal and some 74 odd units of equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.037" offset="2143483">They also had operations coming down from Charleston, West Virginia into this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.210" offset="2164172">Coming up from Bristol, Virginia into this area moving through the same terminal so the result of it would be, you'd probably have 20 shipments on a vehicle, moving from Roanoke to Bluefield, 17 of them going on to destinations in West Virginia, and the remaining three going on to various points down on Southwestern Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.572" offset="2265631">It was stipulated on the record, there's no dispute about this fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.552" offset="2285589">And that is that all operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.030" offset="2295515">All questioned shipments physically moved from a point in Virginia out-of-state through the Bluefield, West Virginia terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.196" offset="2336162">So, we have no problem of them -- in some cases where a carrier short -- shortcut its radial base or its so-called gateway point.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.577" offset="2389661">Now, the State of Virginia's evidence in this case consist almost exclusively apart from the conceded facts that we were doing this, of a map, an official map of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.958" offset="2447235">And they take the position that operations conducted between Roanoke and Whitfield, since they have a percentage of security greater than the most direct highway through were illogical, none direct and the abnormal routes of movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.941" offset="2567084">Unfortunately, by using a map and picturing oneself as driving a car instead of working at -- worked through the transportation experts (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="628.414" offset="2617031">It is -- we are easily mislead by the security problem raised by the State of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.026" offset="2643466">They contend that since there is certain securities in certain of these operations that the operations are a subterfuge to evade the State regulatory process.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.332" offset="2696652">We introduce evidence in this proceeding demonstrating that the operations conducted again, I take my example as Roanoke because it's the only large city in the area and it generates the most traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.589" offset="2757778">From Roanoke to White Sulphur, from Roanoke to Bacliff, from Roanoke to Charleston all of these operations, Your Honors, are securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.264" offset="2808456">So also is the one that -- one of those seven to Whitfield.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.503" offset="2829354">It is securities for mileage and some cases is but twice as great as great as the direct route.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.612" offset="2853804">The reason why there was twice as great as the direct route in transportation handling is that in order to effectively transport a lot of traffic and conducting operations profitably, you must have a flow of freight as the only qualified express transportation witness stated in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.614" offset="2953801">He stated that because the flow of freight -- freight was moving towards Bluefield he could handle shipments down in Whitfield economically by moving them first into Bluefield and then later consolidating with shipments coming in from the north out-of-state points such as Charleston, West Virginia.</text>

            <text syncTime="1364.325" offset="5560717">And accordingly this Court held or sustained the holding of the Missouri authorities to the effect that this was a subterfuge to avoid or evade state regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1543.809" offset="6278562">Now, in the precedent which we rely on presently, the Interstate Commerce Commission case involving Atlantic Freight Lines 51 M.C.C. 175, Atlantic Freight Lines was a carrier and authorized to conduct operations between Pittsburgh all over Maryland, Philadelphia and points in the upper east including New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.713" offset="6386186">It conducted operations in the transportation of sugar from Philadelphia to McKeesport which is a point adjoining Pittsburgh.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.088" offset="6419728">The Pennsylvania authorities prosecuted or proceeded otherwise simply I believe against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.963" offset="6451179">And ultimately prohibited them from further transporting traffic between two Pennsylvania points when they were going out-of-state over this -- over to secure this route through Baltimore and Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.397" offset="6512933">After the -- the approval of PUC's order in Pennsylvania that case came up here on writ of certiorari which was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.851" offset="6566745">The carrier then went to Interstate Commerce Commission under Section 5 (d) of the Administrative Procedure Act and asked the Interstate Commerce Commission to construe its certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.698" offset="6610213">The PUC or -- or Public Utilities Commission of Pennsylvania intervened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.135" offset="6627871">They became a party to that proceeding and ultimately the Interstate Commerce Commission said, “We have issued a certificate here, both points were on the routes involved even though it goes through Baltimore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.131" offset="6679907">We have authorized it, is bona fide, that certificate is a final order and cannot be attacked collaterally in a state court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.153" offset="6720031">And, subsequent thereto, the Public Utilities Commission and the Atlantic Freight Lines in and then there were a consent decree which I have made an appendix to by in my reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.940" offset="6775097">The situation of Pennsylvania at least with regard to that carrier has been clarified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.449" offset="6797145">And I think that it's very strong precedent that the -- the order and the report sustaining the order by the Commission is persuasive on every point and it does consider this Court's opinion and decision in my calls a case that became a -- came on 10 years before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.081" offset="6883662">Now, in addition to the criticism that we may have of the decisions of the Virginia authorities, we'd like to raise the point developed in Castle versus Hayes Freight Lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.260" offset="6956387">The Interstate Commerce Act has, as you know, Section 204 (c) which permits State or any interested party to complain to the Interstate Commerce Commission if the State feels that an interstate operator is conducting operations in violation of its interstate certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.136" offset="7043950">I think the strong suggestion if not actual statement in the Hayes case is to this effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.693" offset="7082193">Now, whether is a genuine problem, a dispute between carrier and State and it appears that the Interstate Commerce Commission has finally jurisdiction, instead of taking up the matter in their own forums, the State should first resort to the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.793" offset="7182503">On the State's reply brief they have suggested that there are so -- certain local aspects in this case and that accordingly that the order be given jurisdiction because of the local aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.553" offset="7233599">The local aspects -- Your Honors, in this case are no more local and operations between Philadelphia and points of New Jersey, New York and New Haven they're 90 miles apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.008" offset="7291382">Some of these points in -- in Virginia are as many as 150 miles apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.100" offset="7319803">But on the law I believe the -- the cases that I've cited on my reply trial brief, Capital Transit cases where you held that the Interstate Commerce Commission had great jurisdiction over the -- over Capital Transit in spite of the fact that they didn't leave or that carrier didn't leave the District of Columbia, fully disposed of the local aspects, contention of the State in amicus curiae.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.152" offset="7420008">They cite in support to their contention the Panhandle case and the Connecticut Light and Power case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.984" offset="7443310">Both of these same cases were cited by the same parties to this Court in the Capital Transit cases and no -- no reference is made to those authorities cited by the State of Virginia in your decision or in your disposition of the Capital Transit cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.281" offset="7544456">Moreover, and finally on the issue of local aspects, protection of local carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.859" offset="7570787">Let's assume that there are so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.551" offset="7577579">I know of one that served at some point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.413" offset="7584998">But let's assume that there are some carriers.These carriers are assumedly, would have the most direct routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.763" offset="7610389">They would be able to operate more quickly, assumedly, or at least that's what the State asks this Court to accept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.859" offset="7638810">Assumedly, they can operate on -- under lower rates because their -- their cost would be lower.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.015" offset="7659395">Then it would seem to me that they could capture all of these traffic which amounts to about $500 per week without difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.085" offset="7695757">Having the direct routes, I see no reason why they couldn't capture it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.894" offset="7710908">But Congress must have recognized in defining interstate commerce as it did in Section 203 for intent of the act that there would be some effect on state operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.027" offset="7771512">And accordingly, I believe that they enacted 206 or the second proviso of 206 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.866" offset="7802859">That proviso permits any Virginia intrastate operator holding a certificate issued by the Virginia State Corporation Commission, to mail that certificate to Washington with an appropriate application form, identify itself, to publish tariffs and it automatically is entitled to an interstate authority, coextensive with its intrastate authority.</text>
