            <label>Mr. Telford Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">This case coming up from the Fourth Circuit is here on reargument under the Court's order of June 29th, 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.765" offset="54962">In that order, counsel were asked to address themselves to a series of questions specified therein, and then both parties have now done this by filing supplemental briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.059" offset="100206">I should add that in both cases, both the Government's brief and the petitioner's brief are directed and pointed specifically to those questions put by the Court and they are, therefore, not intended to replace the briefs that were filed prior to the initial argument of 1958 term.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.051" offset="176170">The Government, however, has reprinted its original brief and bound it with the supplemental, petitioner, being less affluent, has been unable to do that and, therefore, the courts still has our brief and reply brief from the 1958 term and our supplemental brief from the 1959 term and reply brief filed last week.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.350" offset="269375">Now Your Honors, the questions that are stated in that order of June 29th all go to the validity of the indictment, both in the constitutional and statutory sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.747" offset="322978">The Court will recall that when this case was on argument in the 1958 term that there was considerable discussion of other issues, specifically, the sufficiency of the evidence and the fairness of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.626" offset="382433">The Court's order of June 29th, as we read it, does not exclude those -- all the matters from the further discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.935" offset="411690">I doubt the time will permit me this morning to go back to those but we would like to reiterate our belief that they are very substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.224" offset="448888">We have dealt with one or two of them in the supplemental brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.381" offset="461427">And if time permits, I will say a few more words on that score.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.267" offset="476996">However, we do believe that the validity of the indictment itself should now be passed upon, and accordingly, I will proceed directly to the questions that are posed in the Court's order for reargument.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.311" offset="537182">That order incidentally, if the Court has occasion to refer to it, is set out in Appendix A of our supplemental brief on reargument.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.608" offset="578351">The first four questions relate to constitutionality and the fifth to the statutory sufficiency of the indictments.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.490" offset="609907">And with the Court's permission, I would like to deal with the last question first.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.879" offset="631432">I do that because it is quite separate because it can be dealt with more briefly and because, if our view is correct, there is a statutory bar to this prosecution and that would be finally dispositive to the case without touching the constitutional issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.460" offset="713770">And this statutory question can be stated very simply, and that is, whether the statutory bar is coextensive with the statutory crime known as the membership clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.024" offset="772075">Might I also interpolate at this point that the relevant statutes were set forth in our brief filed in the 1958 term.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.899" offset="811572">As a matter of convenience, we've also put the -- the most closely involved statutes, the Smith Act and the pertinent sections of the Internal Security Act in the back of our brief on reargument.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.973" offset="871863">The Court will recall from the prior arguments that the crime charged here under the membership clause is becoming a member or an affiliate of a group or society of persons that advocate force to overthrow its governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.322" offset="945215">And the statutory bar that raises the question under the Internal Security Act, Section 4 (f), provides that neither the holding of office nor membership in any Communist organization by any person shall constitute a violation -- constitute per se a violation of either subsections (a) or (c) of that section itself of the Internal Security Act, or of any other criminal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.029" offset="1052108">Therefore, by its terms, it applies to all of the criminal statutes including the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.474" offset="1073842">The question is whether that bar is coextensive with the membership clause that I have read to before.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.284" offset="1101113">Government says it is not. Government says it is not and that Section 4 (f), with that bar in it, should be read as if it said neither the holding of office nor membership in any Communist organization without knowledge of its advocacy of violent overthrow shall constitute a violation of this or any other criminal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.675" offset="1186691">Of course, 4 (f) doesn't say that and the Government's construction must therefore be derived by inference from the words "per se" constitute per se a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.230" offset="1236846">Now, the Court often and properly reminds counsel before it that when one approaches a question of statutory construction, the first place to look is that the language of the statute itself before entering into the realms of legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.590" offset="1306331">And if we do that, one must first take note of the fact that the Government's principle argument here throughout has been that Section 4 (f), with that statutory bar, relates only to what has been variously described as mere membership, naked membership, membership without more.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.148" offset="1404552">Those descriptive phrases occur throughout the Government's briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.603" offset="1426390">But if we look at the language of 4 (f) itself, we see that that construction is impossible under the -- on the face of the statute because the face of the statute extends that bar not only to membership but to the holding of office.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.851" offset="1487308">And that is certainly something more than mere or naked membership, whatever one is to infer from those expressions.</text>

            <text syncTime="399.728" offset="1598903">It would seem to me that with the word -- the hold it words, the holding of office in there, one must conclude that the bar extends to membership accompanied by the normal attributes of office holding whatever those maybe.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.907" offset="1659611">And I certainly think also that that suggests some familiarity with the purposes of the organization which offices held.</text>

            <text syncTime="625.852" offset="2503367">And Section 2 of the Internal Security Act contains various recitals and findings by Congress about the Communist Party indicating clearly enough that the Congress believed the Communist Party to be an organization that advocates violent overthrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.165" offset="2572643">It says so in so many words in paragraphs 8 and 13 of Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.056" offset="2592183">And then again, and it says in that same section, the Communist Party members are rigidly disciplined and carefully indoctrinated.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.542" offset="2622067">It seems to me incredible that Congress after writing that into Section 2 and writing Communist officers under Section 4 would have intended to mean only Communist officers who do not know what they have been presumably indoctrinated to know.</text>

            <text syncTime="682.328" offset="2729273">And if Congress speaking in Section 2 in this thing about the party, about membership they are in, it would seem to be a -- an almost unavoidable inference, that when they said the office holding, they weren't thinking about what Justice Harlan described as naked office holding but office holding with the normal things one would associate with office holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.133" offset="2820493">And I don't think one normally assumes that an officeholder is -- is ignorant, inactive, or naked.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.352" offset="2853407">This -- these are the normal attributes of office holding and if one is looking for congressional intent, this, I think, is what one would see in that phrase.</text>

            <text syncTime="748.260" offset="2993006">Under the Smith Act, he would have to be charged with advocacy or distribution or organizing or conspiracy to do those things under the Internal Security Act in paragraphs 4 (a) and 4 (c) which are the two other criminal provisions specifically referred to in a statutory bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.363" offset="3077433">Under (c), he would have had to receive or attempt to receive some document from some -- some classified documents.</text>

            <text syncTime="787.781" offset="3151099">This means that under any of those provisions or any other criminal statutes, there must be some conduct other than being an officer or member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.256" offset="3196970">And indeed, all those other provisions do describe other kinds -- describe activities such as advocacy or getting documents which Congress has prescribed as criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.847" offset="3243363">That is the meaning we give to per se. You could not, for example, indict someone under 4 (a) and say that he had committed an act favoring the establishment of a totalitarian dictatorship in that he was an officer of the Communist Party.</text>

            <text syncTime="1313.564" offset="5254165">And if one then deals with office holding not in terms of what it necessarily proves, because I would concede immediately that the fact that you hold office doesn't prove that you have knowledge or prove anything else in particular, but the implications to be drawn from Congress putting that phrase in there and what they probably intended by is quite another matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.366" offset="5333368">That must be viewed in the context of the rest of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.646" offset="5346534">It seems to me incredible that they would have -- have met the holding of office without knowledge of the organization's purposes when they wrote that in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.875" offset="5375478">It doesn't fit with the rest of statute and it doesn't fit with the congressional purpose, because they were trying to write a bar that would assist and protect the registration provisions and if you construe this as the Government construed that they wrote no bar at all, nothing that bars any prosecution that brought without it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.723" offset="5470877">Now, with the Court's permission, I will pass to the other questions in the Court's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.978" offset="5507866">The other four paragraphs of the Court's order for reargument posed nine different questions with respect to constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.935" offset="5547677">And it's undeniable that most of these questions are posed by the case as it has developed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.459" offset="5573799">I should say at the outset that several of these questions arise from the Government's decorative work on the statutes, the addition of new elements to be engrafted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.573" offset="5614237">And it seems to us that the fact that the Government has been obliged by the pressure of the issue to argue based on -- on the things to be added to the statutes is some indication of the purview of the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.963" offset="5679752">These nine questions that the Court has posed, the parties had dealt with those in supplemental briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.733" offset="5702844">I couldn't possibly cover each of the nine in the time available anyhow, and I don't want to weary the Court's arbitration of what's in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.090" offset="5736281">I do want to address myself to several of them. But before doing that, I'd like to make a more general observation about the constitutional problem here because, I think, there's some danger that if we deal with these nine questions into limited way, one will lose sight of what seems to me a more basic and non-technical factor here that underlines them all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.214" offset="5836800">The Smith Act is in the nature -- is in the nature of a sedition statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.818" offset="5859265">It, therefore, deals with what have been called "political crimes", political crimes like treason and sedition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.271" offset="5896986">In defining these crimes and in applying them when people have been prosecuted for the commission, both the legislatures and the courts, I think, had been aware that this is a very tricky evidentiary field, tricky field in an evidentiary sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.998" offset="5963964">And that, generally speaking, guilt for political crimes such as sedition and treason should be based on evidence of the accused actual conduct rather than on or primarily on the state of mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.642" offset="6026553">Of course, this does not obviate the necessity for evidence about state of mind because acts which maybe quite innocent, done with one intent maybe quite guilty or maybe treasonable if done with another, same acts maybe guilty or innocent depending on the intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.201" offset="6100741">Nonetheless, that is evidence about intent coupled with and related to proof of specific conducts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.672" offset="6142642">The -- the wariness that courts and legislatures have felt about political crimes that rest too much in the mind is reflected in the formidable writ acts of treason that has been discussed in this Court's opinion, the Cramer case and, by the way, Justice Jackson dealt this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.455" offset="6217770">The Smith Act and other statutes the Court has had to deal within recent years that are in this general field, have vexed and divided the Court because they raised these acute problems under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.836" offset="6275344">Those that have been upheld have been statutes, which do proscribe seditious activities and utterances in one sort of another, not merely a state of mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.017" offset="6320065">Smith Act relates to advocacy, distribution of literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.007" offset="6335948">Taft-Hartley, filing the false affidavits, espionage acts to other kinds of conducts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.859" offset="6363429">But now, when we come to membership clause, even if contrary to what we think is the teaching of the legislative history here, even if we do read in the additional element of intent, we are still left with a crime, which involves nothing but the circumstances of association plus state of mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.448" offset="6449737">It -- and adding an attempt simply adds another subjective factor that what is already a very subjective crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.576" offset="6486204">Under the membership clause, the accused is not charged with committing or attempting or conspiring to commit any seditious act or utterance at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.699" offset="6534792">It's the matter of association or state of mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.706" offset="6542733">And I think it is awareness of this weakness that has led the Government when this case was already three years old after first conviction to propose this requisite of activity which is referred to in question number three.</text>

            <text syncTime="1733.497" offset="6933943">But here we have a relationship which is far more remote than the quest of the ones in the law such as conspiracy or complicity, and the only thing that is added to that association are subjective factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.211" offset="6988800">It is, I think, undeniable that the other cases, the other crimes that have come up in other cases here, have involved charges of specific conduct such as advocacy, organizing, distributing literature, filing false affidavits, trying to obstruct the drafts, somebody is doing something that they ought not to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.797" offset="7067167">Now, here, we have a much more remote thing and all I am saying this point for the moment is to indicate that awareness of this ephemeral quality in the crime as defining the membership clause is what has pushed the Government toward the interjection in this element of -- of activity, to try to give the crime some more substance and concrete reality than it has in the -- on the Congress to find it in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.637" offset="7194540">Now, does the addition of this factor of activity help unconstitutionality?</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.749" offset="7230903">If the Government proposed, reading into the clause, a requirement of some kind of activity in furtherance of the advocacy that the Smith Act condemns or in assistance of the advocacy that Smith Act condemns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.043" offset="7288163">We would have a different situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.023" offset="7300075">If a defendant were so charged with activity in aid of the advocacy of the unlawful advocacy, then he might be, in any event, guilty of complicity as a principal or an accomplice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.531" offset="7354096">If he engaged in activity pursuant to some kind of an agreement with others that is charged or proved, then you will make out a case of conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.863" offset="7395370">But, if I am at a loss to see, how a charge of activity that is not related to the thing the statute is getting at, which is the advocacy, shows any culpable connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.216" offset="7452839">Now, the Government answers that in their supplemental brief on reargument by saying that any activity indirectly supports and assists the unlawful advocacy, that even though the Communist Party member spends all of his time going around distributing copies of the Stockholm Peace Appeal or something on which opinion certainly might defer but is not guilty advocacy of any kinds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.686" offset="7566733">That conduct of that kind of normal party activity promotes and indirectly supports the unlawful advocacy and that is the reason they say that to add this requirement of activity will sufficiently assist the Constitutionality of the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.257" offset="7644996">It seems to us that this argument proves too much, that its acceptance would greatly large the possible bounds of criminal liability in this field, and would make very deepen roads on the constitutional guarantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.606" offset="7722423">Quite apart from those general observations about this argument, it seems to us that it -- it applies squarely in the face of two decisions of this Court, one quite recent, those two decisions being the De Jonge case and the Yates case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.271" offset="7797029">In the De Jonge case, after all, the -- it was not disputed that the organization involved there was engaged in criminal advocacy. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't but on the appeal to this Court, that was assumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.178" offset="7844676">It was assumed that the organization was engaged in an unlawful advocacy, and it was charged against De Jonge that he assisted in the conduct of a Communist meeting, spoke at it, spoke at length.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.934" offset="7903713">What he said is set forth in length in the stipulation and it was charged that it could be made a crime to assist in the conduct of the meeting under the hospices of an organization engaging in an unlawful advocacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.231" offset="7964839">Certainly, it could have suggested well there that what De Jonge did indirectly supported the unlawful teachings of the Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.000" offset="7995977">Indeed, in that very case, it was charged that De Jonge had urged everybody to come to a meeting the next night in order to show defiance to the police and support the revolutionary activities of the Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.845" offset="8043311">He was not charged in the indictments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.670" offset="8050625">Therefore, the Court said, as charged in the indictments, this is insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.818" offset="8075180">It seems to us the Yates case is -- is equally cutting on -- on this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.716" offset="8102766">The Court there distinguished very carefully between those defendants against whom the Court thought the evidence was so insufficient that there should not even be opportunity for another trial and those that were sent back for another trial, which the Government never chose to proceed with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.000" offset="8175909">And in distinguishing between those two subsequent defendants, certainly, it wasn't on the ground of activity in general, and indeed those five defendants that were acquitted, were exceedingly active members of the Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.797" offset="8239125">And the -- the point goes even further than that, because in the case of the defendant Richmond, the Court specifically noted that there was evidence connecting Richmond with the other conspirators including conspirators who might have been engaged in the unlawful advocacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.880" offset="8311432">Richmond had been the editor of the Party newspaper on the west coast for a period of many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.438" offset="8337659">He was functionary of -- of great importance in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.880" offset="8355422">The Court said his activity did not show anything but lawful and therefore, in -- even though there was evidence of association with the other conspirators including those that might be guilty of unlawful advocacy, this was held not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.672" offset="8430655">I think it might be helpful, in analyzing the constitutional problem at this point, to spend a minute on how the court below, which included eminent and distinguished judges like Judge Parker and others, how did they so easily come to the conclusion that this clause is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.206" offset="8524800">Well, it -- its scholarly sense is rather interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.727" offset="8538906">In Judge Parker's view ever since -- before the Scales case, he had taken the position that association plus knowledge is the same thing as conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.979" offset="8583837">And in his opinion after the first conviction in this case, he said in substance that this is nothing more or less than a charge of conspiracy to overthrow the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.267" offset="8625006">Of course, that view reduces the membership clause to redundancy, because if it's nothing more or less than a charge of conspiracy to overthrow, we are really right back with the other portions of the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.198" offset="8668787">And it seems to me that he also overlooked the distinction between the conspiracy to overthrow and the conspiracy to advocate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.004" offset="8691984">But more important than all of that is that Judge Parker's particular view of this matter of conspiracy is a matter that's been debated in the law institute for a number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.061" offset="8740153">His position, which opened up the concept of conspiracy in his very broad way is one that is not wanted favor and that has been specifically rejected by the law institute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.213" offset="8780800">The citations are in our reply brief filed earlier this week.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.757" offset="8802952">And I think that the Government's defense of the membership clause leads into this same cul de sac.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.824" offset="8831269">The Government is now here in the position of defending this clause primarily on the basis of two elements, intent and activity, neither of which is specified in the statute, and one of which isn't even charged in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.085" offset="8888320">The development of their defense of this clause is, I think, insignificant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.514" offset="8905979">The first membership indictments that were filed in 1948 do not charge specific intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2375.017" offset="9500003">So after each sip, the government cook reaches for some other ingredient to throw in the pot to see if it will make it strong enough.</text>

            <text syncTime="2396.227" offset="9584849">Even if they doubt that the statute might be constitutional in other applications to uphold it as applied to a dedicated fulltime proselytizing communist and hold it constitutional in that application.</text>

            <text syncTime="2438.461" offset="9753809">They never went to the jury about whether or not he's a proselytizing communist fulltime.</text>

            <text syncTime="2447.198" offset="9788709">In the record, it shows that he spent a good deal of time on Party activities, but I don't know exactly what a fulltime Communist is if -- if it means the same thing at elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.826" offset="9827265">There's nothing in the record to show that he was a fulltime Communist.</text>

            <text syncTime="2511.045" offset="10044082">Now, in the -- in the Court's order for reargument, several subsidiary questions are raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.653" offset="10074593">It's asked whether the statute -- whether the -- the membership clause will be valid without activity as a new element of the crime but as a constitutional overlaid standards, something like "clear and present danger".</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.207" offset="10136764">This was suggested by the Solicitor General in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.396" offset="10157558">I confess I have been unable to fathom this idea of the activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.994" offset="10179918">If it's to be brought in the case at all, it should be brought in as a -- as a constitutional standard like clear and present danger that doesn't go to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.118" offset="10216385">Of course, there has been divided opinion about whether the clear and present danger issue should or should not be kept away from the jury but the reasons for doing it were pretty clearly set forth in the various opinions in the Dennis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.372" offset="10269466">We need to take account of a very wide area of factual and circumstantial data, the need for uniformity of outcome, and so forth, but the issue of activity is nothing like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.124" offset="10316487">If there is any proper issue of activity in this case, this is a matter that concerns the individual behavior of one man, the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.805" offset="10351177">It's a kind of issue that juries traditionally deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.683" offset="10366642">And if that issue can be taken from the jury, I should suppose that the question of whether the mails were used in fraud or any other factual issue could equally be taken away in violation of the constitutional guarantee of jury trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2652.571" offset="10610207">This matter of activity went to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.361" offset="10625358">So charged by the judge and went to the jury and jury questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.201" offset="10640718">And so if this is a thing which like clear and present danger should have been found by the -- by the trial court, it never was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.362" offset="10677394">Therefore, it seems to me, if we're going to look to activity at all, the -- the side of this which must be taken more seriously is the idea of activity as an element of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.850" offset="10723370">Now, even there, I think some clarification is needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.153" offset="10736536">As Justice Frankfurter indicated earlier in the argument, proof of membership itself involves some kind of indicia of membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.528" offset="10774047">This may involve some proof of activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.378" offset="10785437">The Court has dealt with the question of what membership is as used in these statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.329" offset="10809260">It isn't necessarily always the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.317" offset="10817202">The nature of the statute may affect it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.164" offset="10828591">But in Galvan against Press, the Court mentioned such things as occasional attendance of meetings, payment dues, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.641" offset="10862550">Therefore, if the Government meant only that proof of membership may entail proof of some activity, I suppose nobody could have any quarrel with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.361" offset="10905391">But if they meant only that, then it would not import any new element to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.423" offset="10933603">It would not do what they appear to hope would be accomplished, that is, inject a new element in the strength of its constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.438" offset="10969652">And therefore, elsewhere and indeed, in the -- in the Court's charge with the jury, it's quite clear that what they really mean is a requirement of a greater degree of activity than would be necessary to prove membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.004" offset="11027958">This is an additional element or additional proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.140" offset="11044467">And their last brief, although as I say in some spots, speaks about an interpretation of the word "membership"; in other places, it's quite clear that they mean proof of something more than is necessary to show membership.</text>

            <text syncTime="2802.849" offset="11211337">Well, it seems to me there had been two or three questions there, Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.031" offset="11236101">I believe that the reason they put for the idea of constitutional standard was in order to meet our argument about the indictment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2818.008" offset="11271941">I've dealt with the constitutional standard part of it already. Now, we come to the thing as an element of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.671" offset="11302661">It can be one or two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.870" offset="11307468">It can be how much activity do you need to prove to establish membership or are we construing the statutes that when it says "membership", it means especially active membership, membership more active than is necessary merely to be a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.774" offset="11375073">I think they mean the latter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.569" offset="11382178">They -- they say in several places, the new element of proof, I think the Court's question number three was phrased in terms of an additional element of defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.062" offset="11420212">Perhaps, an illustration would be helpful here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.681" offset="11438707">Suppose you have a statute that punishes displaying a red flag in public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.652" offset="11462531">How red does the flag have to be?</text>

            <text syncTime="2869.386" offset="11477473">How public must a display be?</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.759" offset="11486981">Well, it obviously must be read enough to be unmistakably read and it's got to be big enough so it's plainly a flag and not a handkerchief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.393" offset="11513522">And it's got to be displayed where the public can get access to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2886.831" offset="11547272">But the Government's apportion of the statute, you would, as if, you would say that to display a blood red flag more than 10 feet square by brandishing on the capital steps is what the statute really means.</text>

            <text syncTime="3116.214" offset="12464797">I shall pitch my argument on the assumption that the opinion of this -- that the decision in United States against Dennis is still good law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.631" offset="12522475">The petitioners have not asked that it'd be overruled and in fact, this Court, in the Yates case much more recent than the Dennis case, has really affirmed the principles established in Dennis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.014" offset="12587990">So I think that the earlier cases dealing with this type of statutes are to be read in the light of the Dennis case itself and that our problem is an application of those rules to the membership clause as such.</text>

            <text syncTime="3283.613" offset="13134367">And so it was very careful to instruct the jury that was necessary for the Government to prove in proving advocacy, not only persuasion but had to prove that the Communist Party was engaging in inciting to action to carry out this aim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.830" offset="13219318">And it was in the light of these instructions that the jury found the -- the defendant guilty.</text>

            <text syncTime="3342.309" offset="13369156">And these schools took place not in one part of the country but all over the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.560" offset="13386188">They were in New York and they were in St. Louis, in Chicago, in Washington and in California.</text>

            <text syncTime="3359.489" offset="13437910">And they were specifically on with respect to the -- the -- whether or not the advocacy dealt with overthrow by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.843" offset="13479288">And everyone of these schools -- in everyone of these schools, this was the -- was the message which was taught.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.823" offset="13515233">The jury had this before them and the jury decided at this point as been proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.808" offset="13531220">Then the question is was this merely discussion, was this merely persuasion or does this amount to incitement to action?</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.500" offset="13577927">Here again, the evidence in all of the school and in private conversations too is explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.106" offset="13616379">The students were told that theory without action is nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.073" offset="13636232">They were told about -- they were -- they were encouraged, they were instructed to take place, take pride in concentrated activity in industries which were important to the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.616" offset="13694433">They would -- in one school, they would require to take an oath at the conclusion of the school that they would act to carry out the -- the aims of the Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.439" offset="13737691">They were instructed to take -- undertake details in connection with the underground, details in connection with communications, shelter, publication and the -- the details of carrying on the -- the Party's duties underground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.198" offset="13804774">In one of the schools, they were instructed with respect to methods of violence, how to use a -- a pencil as dagger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.292" offset="13837166">In other, it wasn't in the school but the defendant himself in -- in instructing one of the witnesses suggested that he attempt to avoid the draft by -- by pretending that he couldn't pass the intelligence examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.993" offset="13911876">The -- the record is replete with instances which show that this teaching wasn't a study group of the Communist manifesto, of the average Communist classics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.546" offset="13970181">These students in these schools were being taught specific action which they should take in order to prepare the -- the Party to carry out its -- its avowed aims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.792" offset="14031099">Now, the third element in proof is to tie the petitioner himself into these pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.573" offset="14062237">Did he know about the Communist thing?</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.171" offset="14076656">If he did know about them, did he intend that they should be carried out?</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.583" offset="14102256">Now, the petitioner in this case was an open and avowed member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.558" offset="14122214">He was the chairman of the District for North and South Carolina for a long period of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.811" offset="14151158">And there is no -- there is no dispute actually that he, for -- for years performed the functions of the -- the leader of the Communist Party in those two -- in those two States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.517" offset="14218031">He organized schools, he attended schools whether our eyewitness accounts of the teachings of the school is including force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.745" offset="14258887">He himself told one of the witnesses in the case that force and violence was the method to carry out the aims of the -- of the Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.757" offset="14294936">He told that the witness listen in so many words.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.376" offset="14313430">There can be -- the -- the knowledge of the Communist aims and purposes is brought home to this particular petitioner in explicit testimony which the jury, under instructions, believed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.822" offset="14371213">So the only question then is whether there was intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.508" offset="14385946">But all of the indicia of what goes on in the man's mind would indicate that he did intend to carry out these purposes which he taught and which he instructed Clontz, Reavis, Childs, the other witnesses as to what they should do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.485" offset="14453864">Unless he was -- unless he was carrying on a -- a double deceit by -- he must have -- must have intended the things which he taught over this long period of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.810" offset="14523141">Therefore, I think as far as the evidence in this case goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.546" offset="14534113">We don't have anything like the problems that occurred in the Yates case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.231" offset="14548846">The case was tried with the Yates case in mind, the instructions were good, and the evidence, it seems to me, certainly justified the Court the -- the jury in making the findings which it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.093" offset="14616346">Therefore, we must turn to the questions of construction and questions of constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.710" offset="14642782">And I shall go first, as Mr. Taylor's did, to the question of Section 4 (f) in order to determine whether or not there was a modification -- modification of the Smith Act through the Internal Security Act which, in effect, wrote membership in the Communist Party out of the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.957" offset="14771827">The language is, "Neither the holding of office nor membership in any Communist organization by any person shall constitute per se a violation of Section -- subsection (a) or subsection (c) of this section or of any other criminal statute."</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.369" offset="14853433">In another section, in the Internal Security Act, Section 17 provides, "The foregoing provisions of this subchapter shall be construed as being in addition to and not in modification of existing criminal statutes."</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.308" offset="14933159">But taking 4 (f) itself, question is what affects could 4 (f) have upon the Smith -- upon the membership clause of the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.154" offset="14984568">And I call that this statute is -- is printed on the appendix to the petitioner's main brief 2A and 3A.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.454" offset="15021767">And I call your attention to the fact that it first says that membership per se shall not be considered a crime under subsection (a) of this same Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.809" offset="15083207">I assume that (f) has the same effect on (a) and (c) that it does on the membership clause of the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.576" offset="15134302">It is intended that (f) should be read, in effect, as part of the Smith Act just as it was to be read in part of -- part of (a) and (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.389" offset="15189473">Now, if the petitioner's argument is sound, I would think he would have to argue that no longer can a Communist because of his Communist activities be proceeded against under section (a) of this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.702" offset="15266795">He would have to say that they wrote the Communist membership in the Communist Party, participation in the Communist Party out of section (a) and section (c) in the same that they -- he would claim they wrote it out of the -- the membership clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3833.944" offset="15335758">Yet, it seems perfectly apparent that Congress didn't intend that you should no longer prosecute Communists under section (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3842.417" offset="15369613">All it meant was that you couldn't prove a violation of section (a) by proving membership in the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3850.424" offset="15401691">And then meant equally, you may not prove violation of the membership clause by proving and stopping that just proving membership per se.</text>

            <text syncTime="4861.223" offset="19444820">We come then to the questions of the construction of the membership clause itself and its constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="4869.851" offset="19479301">In these -- with respect to these, we are referring to -- specifically to the questions asked by the Court in its order setting the case down for reargument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4880.356" offset="19521411">These questions are reprinted on pages 1 and 2 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4888.409" offset="19553593">And the first question is whether the statutes can be sustained even if construed not to require either intent or activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4901.295" offset="19605107">Now, we had thought in view of the Court's holding in the Dennis case that this question was not open to us, because we thought that it was pretty well decided by this Court in the Dennis case that intent should be read into these provisions of the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4922.261" offset="19689012">And in fact, I -- I still believe that -- that this is a proper construction of the -- of the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4930.937" offset="19723703">But assuming for a moment that it's impossible to read intent or activity, you know it, and we have to have the statutes just as -- as membership in the Communist Party with knowledge of its illegal aims.</text>
            <text syncTime="4946.027" offset="19784098">Is that -- is it constitutional, is it constitutional under the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment to punish such action?</text>
            <text syncTime="4956.255" offset="19824953">Well, there's -- there's certainly authority to support the fact that it is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="4961.283" offset="19845120">This Court in Bryant against Zimmerman, 278 United States 63 upheld the New York statutes, which punished membership in the Ku Klux Klan as such, felt that membership in an organization, an illegal organization with knowledge of that organization's aim was, itself, punishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4984.802" offset="19939161">Whitney against California, 274 United States 357 involves a California statute, which punished organization and membership, and there was there a single count indictment alleging both.</text>
            <text syncTime="5003.477" offset="20013871">So that in effect, in upholding that statute, the Supreme Court was upholding a statute with respect to ownership, I think, with respect to membership alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="5011.030" offset="20044069">I think that Judge Parker's statement in Frankfeld against the United States, one of the Smith Act cases, states my position about as well as it can be stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5025.522" offset="20102060">He says, "Membership in an organization renders aid and encouragement to the organization, and when membership is accepted or retained with knowledge that the organization is engaged in an unlawful purpose, the one accepting or retaining membership with such knowledge makes himself a party to the unlawful enterprise in which he is engaged."</text>
            <text syncTime="5053.561" offset="20214178">In other words, membership is an indirect way of carrying on the advocacy which the Party carries on.</text>
            <text syncTime="5064.517" offset="20258064">By being a member, by supporting the organization, by lending one's -- one's moral support or whatever other supports involved in membership to an organization with these purposes is making a contribution to the purposes of the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="5082.847" offset="20331311">Remembering, of course, that it must be done with knowledge of the aims of the organization, then it should be unnecessary to prove intent because the -- the intent almost follows the matter of -- of course that whether or not it does, there is this aid and encouragement to the advocacy whether intent is present or is not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="5107.556" offset="20430158">Now, the second question is whether or not the statute construed to require intent, but presumably not activity, whether with -- when you add the element of intent, you aid in -- in upholding the constitutionality of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5126.431" offset="20505704">Well, I may say that Judge Hand in the Dennis case, and in this Court's opinion in Dennis case, apparently felt that reading intent into this -- into this statute does aid in upholding the constitutionality of the act, because in both of this -- in both of this opinions, both Judge Hand in the Second Circuit and in this Court's opinion in the Dennis case, it was felt that intent was a very important element, and that reading the -- and that it -- that it aided in -- in reaching the -- the -- in tying up the -- the individual with the organization making the nexus clear so as to -- so that one wouldn't be punishing one man for something which an organization did.</text>
            <text syncTime="5174.169" offset="20696607">And there was seemed to be a little difficulty reached by either Judge Hand who dealt with it in a page and a half in this Court that dealt with it just about as previous as a span in finding that Congress intended that intent was an element of this crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="5744.318" offset="22977202">So that Congress very reasonably could have intended that when it used the word "membership" that it's meant membership in an active sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5755.244" offset="23020878">And I think that the Court won't be going far afield in -- in reaching such an interpretation certainly when -- well, when it came to this -- to the -- the anticommunist oath in the labor field.</text>
            <text syncTime="5771.552" offset="23086184">There, the question was, what did belief mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="5774.640" offset="23098514">Congress had to -- the Court had to determine what Congress meant when it used the word "belief in".</text>
            <text syncTime="5782.258" offset="23129025">And the Court had no difficulty in construing belief in as being adhering to and approving rather than just an abstract idea that they understood and -- and gave their general approval to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5800.450" offset="23201750">So we feel that, as a matter of construction of the term "membership", this Court may well find that Congress intended the word to mean active membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="5812.987" offset="23251905">And that was that construction, the -- the constitutionality of the act is -- is considerably bolstered.</text>
            <text syncTime="5823.524" offset="23294015">However, even if -- even if we do not mix this as a matter of construction, it seems to us that it can be considered that in its application to this case, we can consider that here we are applying it to an active member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="5852.508" offset="23409998">And that we need not concern ourselves in this case with how it may be applied in some other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5862.150" offset="23448555">This is what we mean by saying that if it is constitutional in its application to men like Scales, then we don't -- don't need to consider whether it would be constitutional if it were applied to men like the aliens who were involved in -- in the (Inaudible) case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5881.610" offset="23526400">We don't have that case before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="5884.208" offset="23536744">And just as in the -- in the clear and present danger doctrine, we consider whether or not the application of the statute is to a situation where there is a clear and present danger, and if so, uphold it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5897.514" offset="23590034">So here, when it is applied to a situation where you have an active member, as Scales was, you need not consider what the situation would be if it were applied in some other context.</text>
