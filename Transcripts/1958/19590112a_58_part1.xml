            <label>Mr. Philip B. Vogel</label>
            <text syncTime="1.390" offset="108962">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3.412" offset="117008">This lawsuit comes before the Supreme Court of the United States in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.113" offset="143862">The plaintiff below and the petitioner here started her lawsuit in the North Dakota District Court back in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.368" offset="184822">And in her complaint, she alleged that her husband was accidentally killed by gunshot wounds on January 20, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.042" offset="235499">She alleged that at the time of his death, and for many years before his death, he had two different life insurance policies with the New York Life Insurance Company that doubled for accidental death, and she asked for $15,000 on these policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.302" offset="324629">The New York Life Insurance Company, because more than $3000 was involved and because there was a diversity of citizenship, removed the case to the Federal District Court in North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.179" offset="384084">They interposed in answer in which they set up as an affirmative defense their conclusion that Mr. Dick, the husband of the plaintiff, had died by his own hand intensionally and that his death was a suicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.373" offset="452838">The lawsuit was tried before a jury in Fargo and the jury returned the verdict in favor of Mrs. Dick, and held in effect that the death was accidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.365" offset="504874">The attorney for the New York Life Insurance Company moved for a new trial or for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.318" offset="540609">There were extensive arguments before the trial court and the trial judge immediately denied both of those motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.025" offset="579480">The New York Life Insurance Company then appealed to the Eight Circuit Court of Appeals and the Eight Circuit Court of Appeals, by a unanimous judgment, held that because two shots were fired in connection with this man's death that the death had to be suicidal and they ordered judgment for the New York Life Insurance Company.</text>

            <text syncTime="148.138" offset="695881">That is how the lawsuit came before the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.010" offset="711450">We asked for certiorari and certiorari was granted last summer.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.763" offset="734438">Now, these are the facts that are justified by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.477" offset="757321">They are facts that are not contradicted or, as I say, they are justified by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.462" offset="785220">Mr. Dick, at the time of his death, was a man of 47 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.715" offset="810193">He was a strong healthy man who had no troubles of any kind with his family.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.557" offset="837569">He was respected by his neighbors and by his friends.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.559" offset="853556">He owned a section of land near Lisbon, North Dakota and farmed it himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.144" offset="879992">His land was free of all incumbrances.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.769" offset="894412">He had about $1000 in the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.027" offset="911444">He had had no trouble with his family, with his neighbors or with his friends.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.527" offset="937462">He did have some prostate trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.216" offset="948224">He had been treated by that, but the testimony was, that it was a matter of very little consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.416" offset="977063">On the night before he died, he sat down with his wife and his 14-year-old daughter and went over with the daughter her general science lessons explaining to her for an hour the workings of a transformer.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.199" offset="1048116">He went to bed that night and slept soundly.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.672" offset="1062013">The next morning, he got up and ate a hearty breakfast and backed the car out of the garage, so that his wife could take the little girl to the country school.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.423" offset="1109034">He then went out to the barn to take care of his milking and his chores.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.872" offset="1126902">And he and his wife would arranged that after he was through with his chores that what they would do would be to go over to a neighbor's house and help make sausage.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.999" offset="1167339">When Mrs. Dick got back from taking her child to school, her husband was not back in the house from the barn, and so she went out to the barn to look for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.823" offset="1214673">She thought the he might be throwing silage down from the silo.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.052" offset="1235571">And so, she walked into a silage shed, a little building that was about 12 feet long and 8 feet wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.000" offset="1267336">Her husband was lying there on his back with a great wound in his left side and with the top of his head completely blown off.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.095" offset="1303803">She ran back to the house and called the neighbor for help.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.101" offset="1323760">When the sheriff and the other officials arrived, they found the body as it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.899" offset="1346957">They noticed that by the side of the body, there was a double-barrel shotgun and that both barrels of the gun had been discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.428" offset="1385096">The sheriff also noticed that there was a screwdriver, six or eight inches long that was lying somewhere close to the body.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.349" offset="1420727">The officers and the other witnesses also noticed that close by the side of the barn, there had been pin stack of place where Mr. Dick had his hay and his corn and his feed that he kept for his cows.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.501" offset="1481331">They saw that on one side of the fence were the cows and they could see that the cows had eaten up the corn, that the farmer had put over that fence into the mangers for the cows.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.118" offset="1531800">But side by side with the barn and on the side of the fence away from the cattle themselves, there was a bucket that was filled with ground corn.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.322" offset="1576626">And the farmer had been in a habit of always, after he had thrown the silage into the manger of distributing this ground corn over the corn and the silage.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.515" offset="1625422">But on this particular occasion, the ground corn was not distributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.531" offset="1649455">The testimony shows at several months before the happening of this man's death, he had been bothered in the operation of his farm by vicious dogs attacking his flock of sheep.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.816" offset="1702640">He had a flock of about 100 sheep.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.280" offset="1712462">And on one occasion, several months before his death, about 30 of the sheep were either killed or mangled.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.702" offset="1746213">I believe that the jury believed and I believe that what happened was that he was out feeding his cattle.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.886" offset="1774947">He had put the corn on the side of the fence where the cattle were.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.696" offset="1794173">He was about to pour the corn over the feeds so that the cattle could eat the feed and the corn when he saw something close to his flock of sheep whether it was a vicious dog or more than one dogs, no one knows, because no one was on the farm at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.374" offset="1860838">But at any rate, he put the bucket of corn down.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.849" offset="1874735">It was snowing at the time and there was a slight amount of snow that covered the basket of corn.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.769" offset="1902425">And into the barn he went and there, he was found with these two wounds, one in his side and the other on the top of his head.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.845" offset="1946728">The insurance company took the position that what he had done was to set down the bucket of feed and had gone into the barn, intent on killing himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.096" offset="1987793">We believe that he went into the barn to get his shotgun which was always kept in the barn to attack the vicious dogs that may have been in the neighborhood at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.798" offset="2034604">At the time of this man's death, when he was found lying on the shed of this silo room, he was wearing some heavy gleasy, woolen, cotton gloves that were bulky gloves that could only, with some effort, be inserted into the gun trigger guard so that the trigger of the gun could be pulled.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.546" offset="2141602">And I am sure that the jury felt under those circumstances that if a man have planned to and wanted to do away with himself, wanted to perform what was for him the most important act of his whole life, under no circumstances would he be wearing any gloves at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.183" offset="2208057">And if he wanted to do that, he certainly would not be wearing heavy bulky gloves that could hardly be inserted into the trigger guard of the gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.841" offset="2250689">Another important thing, it was important, I believe, to the jury into the trial court was that there was no blood whatsoever on the gloves.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.738" offset="2286320">They're entirely free of blood and so as the gun itself free of any blood.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.685" offset="2306069">And it seems to me that what had happened was that if the insurance company were right that this man would set down his bucket of corn and would go into the shed the intent upon killing himself and aimed the gun barrel at his side here and pull one of the triggers to shoot off one of the shotgun shells that under those circumstances, if he had done that, he certainly would have taken his hand or his gloves to examine his sight to see whether the wound which he had was mortal or not, to see whether he was about to die from the wound that he had inflicted, but as I say, there was no blood of any kind either on his gloves or on his hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.512" offset="2501465">The doctor who testified in the lawsuit and who came to the scene of this man's death testified that the first wound that the man had on his side was a wound that was about six or seven inches long that started rather low in the back on the side and came in an upward point that it was a severe wound, abrasive wound, but that the effect of it was to completely collapse the man's left lung.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.020" offset="2631450">The doctor said that under those circumstances, the pain that the man would have would be unbearable and if -- yes --</text>

            <text syncTime="1619.371" offset="6580851">And again in that case, our Supreme Court held that it was for the jury to determine whether or not the man died from suicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.188" offset="6616168">Mr. Paulsen was arrested by some officers in a canyon in Montana in connection with the hunting violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.793" offset="6654516">It was apparently not a serious violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1657.334" offset="6732675">And into the room, they searched him thoroughly and found nothing on him of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.774" offset="6754513">One of the officers testified at the trial that if he had strychnine on him at the time he was taken to the room, he must have had the strychnine in his boots.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.321" offset="6796622">He went to sleep that night.</text>

            <text syncTime="1680.972" offset="6827238">A container that was empty and that had contained strychnine was found below his bed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.363" offset="6852838">The man died very shortly thereafter, and our Supreme Court held that under those circumstances, particularly because his violation of the law was not great and was not serious because there was no reason why the man should do away with himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.707" offset="6918248">It was for the jury to determine whether or not this strychnine had been given to Mr. Paulsen by Paulsen intentionally or unintentionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.521" offset="6973419">It is the position of Mrs. Dick that as far as the Circuit Court of Appeals is concern, that what they did was to weigh the evidence in this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.642" offset="7021902">It is our position that the jury had decided this case in favor of the plaintiff that there was substantial evidence and more than substantial evidence to show that this man's death was accidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.933" offset="7087104">The jury decided that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.149" offset="7095986">The District Judge supported the jury and when the Circuit Court of Appeals in its opinion weighed the evidence and decided for themselves to the contrary, they were doing something that under the command of the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, they could not do.</text>
