            <label>Mr. Alan J. Hofheimer</label>
            <text syncTime="10.912" offset="146996">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.186" offset="164133">I think I -- I've said that the Department of Labor launched a two-pronged attack against that firm, the firm that we represent and I used that divisively for this reason that both in the trial court and in the Court of Appeals the Department of Labor stressed the point that plans and specifications were goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.685" offset="278131">That was their main frontal attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.805" offset="290565">They set out I think to prove that plans and specifications were goods if they could and of course they did not succeed in either tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.259" offset="344377">Failing that, and as a second prong of the attack was the contention that the employees of this firm were engaged in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.699" offset="402160">I note that in the appeal on the writ of certiorari to this Court the -- the seal has been slightly reversed and now the first frontal attack is that the employees are engaged in commerce and secondly, we meet the issue that plans and specifications are goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.537" offset="489514">I should like to say at outset that -- and I think it should be clearly understood, that our clients in this case, the respondent -- respondents are independent art -- architects and engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.711" offset="562239">Case after case in the various Courts of Appeal have been resolved, some one way and some the other where draftsmen and chainmen and other people who do the same type of work that our employees do who are employed by contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.402" offset="644995">I think there is not a large contractual firm that doesn't employ chainmen and draftsmen and other people similarly to those employed by an independent firm, but we think that under the Act, it's very important to bear in mind the fact because we get to the question eventually of remoteness to bear mind in the fact, that the firm that we represent the defendants in this case as originally brought, do not participate in any construction whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.486" offset="805282">They -- there's no evidence in the record of their having any job site engineers and there is no evidence in the record of their participating actively in any construction work at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.840" offset="858781">Now with that as a background I should like first to direct my argument to the question of whether or not plans and specifications are goods under this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.919" offset="914996">I'd like to say here that I do not believe that there's a single court in the country that has held that plans and specifications are goods.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan J. Hofheimer</label>
            <text syncTime="216.935" offset="971107">In the Brown case Mr. Justice it was particularly held in the last sentence of the Brown case that we will not pass upon that point because we will hold that the employees are engaged in commerce and the judge in the Brown case particularly said that he wouldn't decide whether or not plans and specifications are goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.139" offset="1047907">He wasn't called upon to pass on that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.193" offset="1068178">The case that we think is the leading exposition, in other words, in the Brown case -- we think the case that is the leading case on this point in that it discusses the matter or one of the leading cases because Judge Learned Hand did in a case dealing with the -- not with plans and specifications but with a -- a similar typewritten manifestation.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.977" offset="1195238">In the -- in the case that the appellant refers to as the old Turpin case, which is a District Court case decided by Judge Chesnut down in Baltimore.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.816" offset="1238601">He went into the matter in great detail and we think with a great deal of effectiveness and conviction and with the Court's permission I should like to read what Judge Chesnut said.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.099" offset="1291786">This is case is McComb against Turpin.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.577" offset="1301713">It's in 81 F.Supp. 86 and I'm reading from that brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.146" offset="1327940">Judge Chesnut with impressive clarity and reason then he explained why plans, drawings, and specifications are not goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.104" offset="1363780">They are only a physical embodiment in words of professional conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.442" offset="1393142">The opinion continues in the words of Justice Holmes in Federal Base Ball Club of Baltimore against National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs, 259 U.S. 200 and I quote, “Personal effort, not related to production, is not a subject of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.443" offset="1465135">That which in its consummation is not commerce does not become commerce among the States because the transportation that we have mentioned takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.979" offset="1499303">A firm of lawyers sending out a member to argue a case, on the Chautauqua lecture bureau -- or the -- or the Chautauqua lecture bureau sending out lecturers, does not engage in such commerce because the lawyer or lecturer goes to another State. Certainly the word goods could not be construed to include professional advices and its definition should not be construed to include the type-written or mechanical expression by which the advice is given.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.997" offset="1623333">Now that was the opinion of Judge Chesnut on plans and specifications which we think is the only case that we have been able to find and I think our adversary certainly would have found the other if he could tell the other way, this is the only case we've been able to find, dealing directly with plans and specifications.</text>

            <text syncTime="690.904" offset="2866970">Certainly the words “goods” could not be construed to include professional advices and its definition should not be construed to include the typewritten or mechanical expression by which the advice is given.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.861" offset="2918797">These plans, drawings and specifications are not themselves the subject of border or sale but only the written embodiment of professional advice incidental thereto -- and incidental thereto.</text>

            <text syncTime="727.135" offset="3011897">They are of course quite unlike stocks, bonds, and commercial paper which call themselves instrumentalities of commerce, Bozant against Bank of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.535" offset="3053484">This distinction was well made by Circuit Judge Learned Hand in the case cited the 156 F.2d 789 as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.983" offset="3087339">Some of the activities which went on we agree should on no theory be counted.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.030" offset="3107506">A lawyer who in the course of his practice writes letters or draws deeds or wills, (Inaudible) in the record, is not on that account within 203 (j) and the same as true of the correspondence of a broker and of a banker.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.344" offset="3176782">And if Your Honor please that, is we come to that -- we think would obtain to lawyers analogous as well as to us analogous too incidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.652" offset="3210010">The definition of goods in 203 (i) might literally go so far even as that, but it would be unreasonable to the last degree to suppose that Congress meant to cover such incidents of a bidder whose purpose did not comprise the production of goods at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.655" offset="3285974">And if Your Honor please that we think it disposes of the question and we think it disposes of the question of whether or not plans and specifications are goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.863" offset="3330800">We think the Judge Chestnut's opinion and Judge Hand's opinion in the absence of any opinion to the contrary leads us to believe that it's just with these two judges -- that they are just what these two judges say they are, typewritten manifestation or expressions if you will of professional ideas.</text>

            <text syncTime="1613.716" offset="6558281">It was constructed in Maryland and if any supervision had furnished that -- of course it's done outside of the district.</text>

            <text syncTime="1652.789" offset="6714493">And the Judge said, he spoke about the Fair Labor Standards Act as constituting in Laudadio against White.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.331" offset="6748662">And, that was the case where the draftsmen in that case were employees of a contractual firm.</text>

            <text syncTime="1676.696" offset="6810206">So, here defendant employee's preparation of plans and specifications for the repair and improvement of existing instrumentalities of commerce together with the activities of the resident engineer at the actual job site was sufficient to bring him within the coverage of the in commerce rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.725" offset="6886275">Now we submit that we have no evidence in this record about having done any work on an existing instrumentality of commerce nor is there any record, any evidence in the record about having ever had a man at a job site a resident engineer at the job site to supervise construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.302" offset="6968613">We just don't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.204" offset="6976240">We have never done it and there is nothing in the record that says we did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.430" offset="6989093">So we submit that -- that this independent profession firm is not producing goods in commerce and it's too remote to be considered as an employee engaged in this.</text>

            <text syncTime="1888.909" offset="7658977">Well, but now the definition of goods in this Act was certainly broad enough to cover any kind property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.691" offset="7686144">Now we ask the Court to consider what Judge Soper's reasoning was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.818" offset="7706624">This -- his first reasoning and he rested largely on the Turpin case which was the District of Maryland which was decided some four years I think before the Powell decision came down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.426" offset="7753122">The Powell decision made it very clear that the Act was not limited to articles of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.183" offset="7776110">Western Union had already made it clear, it's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.433" offset="7789066">That this was -- what not was so limited, it was specifically amended, the definition of goods so as not to limit it to all articles of trade and in Powell, this Court said Congress was concerned with eliminating widespread existence of substandard working conditions which could be reached by Congress through its through interstate, through its power to regulate interstate transportation of the products of those conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.347" offset="7904737">In other words what Congress was concerned with was the work product of substandard condition -- of substandard conditions and there's no question but what these plans and specifications are the work products of employees who are doing routine work, they're the same kind of workers that Congress was concerned with and in fact that the plans and specifications are not merely the architect's ideas or the engineer's ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.611" offset="8025840">They're the composite of the work of ordinary laborers and the architect and what seems to be obvious here is that because professional people supervise these ordinary laborers, ordinary employees that therefore the employees should be exempt their -- as these professionals here.</text>
