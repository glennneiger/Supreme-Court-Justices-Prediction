            <text syncTime="110.851" offset="546774">Review was sought and granted in 12 of the cases on two separate petitions for certiorari, which are No. 5 and No. 6 as they now stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.505" offset="589406">The 12 cases were along with the other that made up the 22.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.169" offset="608005">They were briefed together in the Supreme Court of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.737" offset="622320">I believe they present identical issues although there were separate records even though some of the trials were combined for convenience and although the findings and injunctional orders are not identical in the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.693" offset="682193">The final order were all orders of injunction pursuant to a decision of the Supreme Court even though it's different somewhat as I shall later explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.329" offset="732662">The -- it is difficult with -- throughout the separate records and 12 separate proceedings to trace the course of this litigation which has an important bearing upon the case in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.389" offset="800893">And in order to -- in some convenient way since a stipulation to consolidate it was not available because of the counsel on the other side thought were good and sufficient reason, I'm sure they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.183" offset="852093">I thought it might be convenient for the Court to set out a litigation chronology.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.746" offset="870379">And you may find it convenient as I make my argument to refer to that chronology.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.522" offset="893471">It is contained in Appendix B through our brief, the green brief and sets out in quite graphic form the history of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.875" offset="946866">I shall have occasion to make reference to the history as we go along.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.581" offset="961703">And I think Your Honors may find it, as I say, convenient to -- to examine this chronology.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.296" offset="1004544">First, let me address myself to the background of facts before turning to the course of the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.317" offset="1028681">In February 1955, the petitioner union, which organizes hotel and restaurant workers throughout the country, began a campaign to organize the employees in the service trades in the Miami Beach, Miami area in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.106" offset="1099839">The record in the case shows that while these, as the respondents probably goes in their answers and pleadings, are luxury hotels and as perhaps, we can recognize from the names of the hotels which are set forth from the chronology, there was a considerable background of dissatisfaction with the wages, hours and the poor working conditions of these hotels.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.405" offset="1209031">And consequently, the campaign for organization met with considerable success.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.152" offset="1239960">Now, normally, at this stage of the proceeding, the workers having been organized and the hotels themselves have engaged in an industry affecting commerce, the recourse would have been made by the union to the National Labor Relations Board for election and certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.121" offset="1323865">However, it was not available to the union because the National Labor Relations Board in the exercise of its alleged discretion, and this matter will come before this Court immediately following in case No. 21, where this is challenged by the union by way of a -- injunction proceeding to compel the Labor Board to take jurisdiction in this very -- this very dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.886" offset="1430967">However, in -- at the setting as it stood in the organizational stage --</text>

            <text syncTime="898.547" offset="3697560">You will see that while the state law declares it to be the policy of the State to encourage the right to self-organization and to engage in concerted activities, the State of Florida prescribe neither a method for resolving representation cases for elections nor did it prescribe any procedure for handling unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.737" offset="3794317">This is a declaration of general policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.194" offset="3808110">And it's very interesting to note, although I don't think it's involved in this case because the Florida courts avoided this issue except one lower court withheld it that this provision unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.778" offset="3854503">Section 9, which appears on page 3, it says, “It shall be unlawful for any person -- person to participate in a strike or a walkout without the same being authorized by majority vote of the employees to be governed thereby provided that this shall not prohibit any person from terminating employment of his own volition.”</text>
            <text syncTime="957.650" offset="3934020">There is no procedure in the state law for determining any majority vote on the strike issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="970.545" offset="3985533">Now, in this State, I -- I should point out that the union in addition to making a request for secret election published advertisements to this effect saying that they wanted secret election.</text>

            <text syncTime="1063.452" offset="4357204">This complaint alleged that a couple of carpetbaggers from the north came in to organize the union, that the employees did not want the organization and that the picket line was formed, that violence had been committed on the picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.215" offset="4420211">And that also the object of the picketing was to coerce the employer to coerce the employees to join the union.</text>

            <text syncTime="1110.871" offset="4546853">It also appears from the record that the plaintiffs, in many instances, who owned these hotels, were residents of northern and western cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.507" offset="4589380">In any event, complaint filed, and you will notice that immediately following on April 17th, the strike and picketing commends at the Sans Souci Hotel and immediately following strike and picketing commenced at the Sherry Frontenac Hotel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.710" offset="4658239">Now, it is important for Your Honors to know what it was that in the picketing that was complained about and the -- the picket sign which is set forth on page 5 of the record, and I wish to quote it, “This hotel refused to negotiate with the Hotel Employees Union, Local 255, American Federation of Labor, 1575 Worthington Avenue, Miami Beach.</text>

            <text syncTime="2293.198" offset="9276165">And upon the hearing of the evidence by the Chancellor, the Chancellor entered orders in which he found again that the union had met the standards, which appeared by a way of dicta in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.191" offset="9336142">In some of the cases, the union brought in their people into Court, and they testified that they were members of the union.</text>

            <text syncTime="2355.068" offset="9523597">And at this election, a majority -- an overwhelming majority of workers in all of these hotels voted to support the union and support the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.174" offset="9564035">It ran 2000 and something to 80.</text>

            <text syncTime="2393.914" offset="9679078">Then, in order to speed this chronology alone, then the cases went up again to the Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2507.271" offset="10132459">They were confronted with this other decision which said you must demonstrate to the employer what you represent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.644" offset="10157955">They didn't quite know what it meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.805" offset="10166627">But they went to the employer and they did follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.335" offset="10176763">Before they conducted any picketing, they went to the employer and they said number one, we would like a secret election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.132" offset="10207901">Number two, here is a list of our demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.098" offset="10223783">There have been some questions of whether they had notice of the demand.</text>

            <text syncTime="2535.470" offset="10245204">Three, these are all set forth, the -- the notice are set forth in 310 of the record, the bargaining demands in 312.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.548" offset="10281566">They then said to the employer, “Here is an affidavit from a certified public account, which certifies that he has examined our records and checking them against the list of hotel employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.705" offset="10334229">We represent a majority of accountants certified who represent a majority of the employees at the hotel.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.904" offset="10367039">The hotel countered by saying this, “As we read the decision, you have to prove this to our satisfaction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.301" offset="10400580">They said, “Here is the CPA affidavit.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.676" offset="10410088">They said, “That does not prove our satisfaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.501" offset="10421373">What we want is the right to interrogate these employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.982" offset="10439346">In your presence of course, but interrogate.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.872" offset="10450840">Now, mind you, in the first four case, three cases, where the employees had gone out on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.857" offset="10470797">They're all had been replaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.134" offset="10479888">The union said -- was even willing to go this far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.659" offset="10493994">They said, “If you interrogate the employees, would you recognize the union for those employees have say that the union represents them?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.626" offset="10525863">Under the law of Florida, there is no majority exclusive representation rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.733" offset="10546343">You may represent the union for your members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.069" offset="10555643">And in fact, the settlements that have been made in many of these cases that are not here were for members only.</text>

            <text syncTime="2655.039" offset="10723558">And the union said, “Well, we'll make you another offer, even though, under the law of Florida, you don't have to recognize what we can deal for our members.</text>

            <text syncTime="2704.645" offset="10921984">Finally, there's one other case which I want to mention very briefly and then I will move into the discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.099" offset="10951764">San Marino, the Chancellor confronted with this argument to who represented whom, thought in the exercise of his equity power since there were no machinery provided in the Florida statute for elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.844" offset="11002755">He denied the injunction pending a secret -- he grabbed the injunction pending a secret election by a commissioner appointed by him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.101" offset="11047790">The hotels promptly went to the Supreme Court of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.234" offset="11060328">And another one of its opinion, the Supreme Court reversed step section of the order appointing a commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.849" offset="11086764">But peculiarly enough that -- in effect that section of the order granting an injunction until an election was conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.609" offset="11117798">So they have the anomaly of an injunctional order that said you are enjoined from picketing until an election is conducted, but the Supreme Court tore down that part of the order which said there's an election ought to be conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.709" offset="11170252">Now, finally, in the final chapter in this unfortunate saga, there's the final decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.376" offset="11208913">These were all temporary orders, so they had to go back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.426" offset="11225109">Stipulations were made for final orders and there were all injunctions then.</text>

            <text syncTime="3034.886" offset="12242944">On this record, the questions presented, it seems to me, are whether the State, in this case Florida, consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment may prohibit picketing by union engaged in an attempt to achieve union recognition and collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.507" offset="12309400">And in an industry this case, the hotel industry, where the objective sought to be achieved by the picket is not unlawful or contrary to any policy in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.127" offset="12343881">The picket signs are truthful and the picketing is peaceful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.065" offset="12355584">And as I read the decisions of this Court, the decision of the Court do not, in their various treatments of the subject, even suggest that picketing has communication that maybe more than communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.652" offset="12405948">But the picketing I described was communications picketing that they were seeking to an election or seeking collective bargaining can be constitutionally restrained.</text>

            <text syncTime="5932.819" offset="23834624">No, it would not make them timely.</text>
            <text syncTime="5934.034" offset="23839535">They have no right to file without leave of court for 20 days after the case becomes an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="5939.348" offset="23860746">I say true, this was much after that and was filed without leave of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5945.478" offset="23885302">Now, in the Fairlawn case, the -- the Chief Justice has clearly pointed out, has clearly pointed out that throughout that litigation in the state court, there was always the question raised and urged in the National Labor Relations Board and the National -- preempted the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5968.567" offset="23977671">Justice pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="5970.208" offset="23984253">And it was not pointed out, I assume.</text>
            <text syncTime="5972.798" offset="23994598">And I -- it was pointed out because this Court in its inception had jurisdiction of this litigation at this class of cases, but something must be done and must be done timely.</text>
            <text syncTime="5985.189" offset="24044126">And in other cases, this Court had said there had been no suggestion when this question was raised that is frivolous or that is dilatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="5994.428" offset="24081115">Now, I ask, I ask, a court of general jurisdiction who perceives in a case -- in a class of cases that has jurisdiction made the union come in and litigate like the benefit of its decrees, like we find itself until the last moment and then filed in every case what they call the supplemental answer, and then we all stipulate the final decree so we'll get the cases on with and then he says I don't want to introduce an affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6031.178" offset="24228133">And we will stipulate that we'll go in and get final decrees, final decree, you read on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="6036.928" offset="24251120">We've got an affidavit for a man named Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="6040.093" offset="24263764">And stipulate here that you -- that you objected on the ground that it's immaterial and irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="6046.365" offset="24288841">And the final decrees are drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="6048.890" offset="24298977">And the trial court, not a single trial court, except one, ever knew that this issue was involved in this litigation.</text>
