            <label>Mr. David W. Peck</label>
            <text syncTime="8.769" offset="138428">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.651" offset="150026">I was advising the Court at the recess reminding you of the substance of the complaint filed in 1941 which was that the receipt of dividends, any dividends by the shipper-owners of the pipelines was a rebate.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.419" offset="257024">The Government painted with the broadest possible brush in that complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.599" offset="277817">There was nothing about relating the dividends to shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.229" offset="300283">It was all-embracing that the payment of any dividend to any shipper-owner was a rebate and the relief requested was treble damages over a period of years and an injunction against the payment of dividends in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.481" offset="377292">The answer of the defendants was a categorical denial that the payment of dividends which were calculated as any dividend would be calculated in ordinary course from earnings and paid in ordinary course without any relation to shipments out of earnings in due course, could not be considered in anyway a rebate.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.217" offset="492231">And the defendants contended that the Elkins Act had no application whatever to the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.331" offset="528697">In that posture, the parties agreed to a consent decree, a simple decree which was a limitation on dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.864" offset="586794">Now, if Your Honors would turn to the decree which you may find as an appendix to our brief, the pertinent provisions or at page 10 of the record, I would like to call Your Honors' attention to the exact wording of paragraph 3 of the decree because there in a sentence or two, is the whole issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.413" offset="693060">Paragraph 3 provides that no common carrier may thereafter, in any year, pay to any of its shipper-owners as a dividend or any payment, any sums in excess of its share.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.385" offset="792952">That is, a shipper-owner's share, its share of 7% of the valuation of such common carrier's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.522" offset="845511">And then it goes on to say that so far as the Interstate Commerce Act and Elkins Act are concerned, a carrier may pay 7%.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.479" offset="901308">Valuation is defined in 3 (a) and I think it not -- need not be tamed, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.738" offset="930356">There is no dispute about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.431" offset="937148">It is valuation as found from time to time by the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.497" offset="993364">Now, the question in this case, very simple question and we respect a very -- respectfully submit a very simple answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.885" offset="1034951">What is the meaning of the words “its share of 7 percentum of valuation”?</text>
            <text syncTime="242.702" offset="1074134">And we submit that that meaning is perfectly clear and always has been clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.516" offset="1101406">Valuation as I have advised Your Honor and as Mr. Bicks has told you is not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.211" offset="1124185">It is the valuation as found by the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.774" offset="1146441">Likewise, there can be and there's no dispute about what 7% of valuation is in any year.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.316" offset="1180609">So, the question is what is meant by a shipper-owner as an individual, single shipper-owner's -- its share of that 7% of valuation?</text>
            <text syncTime="285.319" offset="1244662">This decree obviously had two purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.644" offset="1257932">One, was to limit dividends overall to 7% of valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.268" offset="1284472">The other, was to provide a formula as to how that 7% of valuation was to be distributed among the shipper-owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.528" offset="1333478">That comes back to what I said to Your Honors in the beginning, a basic fact here that many of these carriers are owned by several shipper-owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.628" offset="1381857">In other words, the ownership is shared and as you observe this limitation is framed in the singular as to what a carrier may pay to each shipper-owner and of course what could be paid was its share, its equity share of 7% of the valuation as defined, because if Your Honors will just concentrate for one moment on that language and bracket out, if you're well either physically or mentally the words “its share” and you will see the significance and purpose of the words “except for its share.”</text>
            <text syncTime="369.507" offset="1581432">It would mean that a carrier could pay to each shipper-owner 7% of the valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.896" offset="1618944">Clearly, that was not intended and as I had observed because this decree was -- was framed in the singular as to what might be paid to each shipper-owner, it provided that each shipper-owner might get only its share, plainly we say, a share proportionate to share owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.548" offset="1705566">It would be impossible to give it any other meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.359" offset="1732838">Now, I come to the 16 years of uniform and consistent administration of this decree between 1941 and 1957 about which Mr. Bicks has been entirely frank.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.355" offset="1812773">Paragraph 8 of this decree requires each carrier, each year to submit to the Attorney General a report showing its compliance with the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.004" offset="1871391">There is set fourth the information which must be supplied in order that each year the Attorney General might check on compliance, be fully informed and know at a glance whether or not this decree is being observed and that is --</text>

            <text syncTime="480.028" offset="2023528">As the Government counsel has conceded, all during those 16 years from 1951 to 1957, the Attorney General was fully informed as to exactly how this decree was being applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.171" offset="2100015">Yes, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, at -- at page 31 of the record, 31, you will find the -- a sample.</text>

          <turn speaker="david_w_peck" startTime="518.416" stopTime="855.712">
            <label>Mr. David W. Peck</label>
            <text syncTime="518.416" offset="2177024">I'm told also page 100 -- page 118 of the record and 159 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.632" offset="2221850">The Attorney General has known what the fullest disclosure, valuation has been used, 7% has been taken, and that the 7% has been divided where there were several shipper-owners among the shipper-owners in any case in accordance what their shares of ownership and that no deduction at anytime has ever been made for debt, that no consideration has been given at anytime to any suggestion that there was such a thing as a creditor share of this dividend that could not be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.505" offset="2413380">The full 7% as the decree provides, 7 percentum may be paid, has been paid divided as I have indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.667" offset="2470013">Now, that is no mere negative attitude upon the part of the Attorney General who was not only charged with responsibility of observing the enforcement of this decree but who actually as has been pointed out, policed it by raising numerous questions over the years as to how this was being done or how that was being done.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.260" offset="2588400">But at no time suggesting that the central provision of the decree, this heart of it, the 7% provision was not being observed in exact accordance with its terms and intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.726" offset="2662275">And indeed, in the year 1944 in February I believe, Senator Gillette, addressed the communication to then -- then Attorney General, Attorney General Biddle who was also the Attorney General at the time in this decree was entered and who was, this record shows, actually participating in the framing of the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.154" offset="2775960">So the Court maybe sure that Attorney General Biddle was familiar with the decree, what was in the decree, what was intended by the decree, and how the decree had been observed.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.659" offset="2829981">And Senator Gillette addressed the inquiry to the Attorney General and asked whether or not the decree was being complied with by the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.189" offset="2884106">And the Attorney General responded by saying that with an exemption which is wholly immaterial as far as this case is concerned, the carriers have been in compliance with the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.945" offset="2959130">And then he summed up in order to enlighten the Senator, in a capsule, by saying that the shipper-owner may receive 7% of the valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.404" offset="3024959">Of course, that's what the decree said.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.319" offset="3040632">That's the way it had been observed.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.811" offset="3050663">Now, I want to address for just one moment to pick up one comment made by Mr. Bicks.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.733" offset="3094340">He suggested something about changing conditions over the years as far as debt is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.600" offset="3133733">He has appended to his brief here, as in Appendix Court, what purports to be a picture of the debt progress over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.933" offset="3187127">Not in the record, anything about this but he has produced that here and I will make a comment or two upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.742" offset="3234356">One, is that if regard is had for surplus as well as for capital, which he does have regard for in his Appendix A and B, the debt proportion will come down to about 50%.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.397" offset="3332995">In other words, at the present time accepting this chart and these figures, debt in these companies now amounts to about 50% which I suggest to Your Honors, is quite an ordinary debt picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.664" offset="3410004">Again, accepting this table, if you would draw some conclusion as to when debt became very significant, it certainly was there 10 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.820" offset="3486699">The reason is quite obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.371" offset="3496835">Within the year since this decree has been in operation, pipelines have been extended three times over.</text>

            <text syncTime="855.712" offset="3526196">Was debt there, Judge Peck, when the decree was signed?</text>

          <turn speaker="david_w_peck" startTime="858.716" stopTime="1255.324">
            <label>Mr. David W. Peck</label>
            <text syncTime="858.716" offset="3538213">Debt was there, Mr. Justice Brennan.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.247" offset="3556394">The record shows that several of the companies had debt in varying amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.363" offset="3592861">The plantation pipeline had debt at that time of 50% of its capitalization, $10 million of debt and $10 million in capital stock and there can be no question but what the Attorney General was fully conscious of the presence of debt because this decree in paragraph 5 which is also attached to our appendix and which might -- may be found at page 12 of the record contains this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.497" offset="3757328">The earnings in excess of 7% on valuation may not be paid out.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.028" offset="3795466">And Section 5 provides what may be done with such earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.045" offset="3823574">They may be employed for working capital or certain other purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.247" offset="3856384">But the particular one I would call You Honor's attention to at the moment in response to your question, Mr. Justice Brennan, is that one other thing that maybe done with the excess earnings is to pay off existing debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.688" offset="3918137">So, perfectly, obviously the parties were conscious of the existence of debt and that impact on the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.449" offset="3969128">In other words, perhaps there's still a prospect of debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.158" offset="3988041">Within the year after this decree was framed and entered, the Attorney General and the same Attorney General and the same Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division, Mr. Thurman Arnold, a gentleman who signed the decree received an application from the Great Lakes Pipe Line Company to recapitalize and for quite obvious reasons it was necessary to get an order of the Court that the proposed recapitalization would not be a violation of the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.009" offset="4155434">And to simplify it in a word, I think a word is all that is necessary, the proposal was in the case of the Great Lakes Company which at that time had some debt but not much debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.818" offset="4214680">It was at least 90% equity capital, less than 10% of debt, wanted to retire its capital by issuing the benchers in the amount of $12 million and to take almost the entire $12 million out and retire capital, in other words, the substitute debt to the extent of 83% of its capital structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.885" offset="4378937">Now, obviously, that had to be approved by the Court because all that could be paid under the decree was 7% on valuation in any year which I don't know what it was, perhaps -- well I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.370" offset="4432854">But nothing like $11 million or $12 million could have been paid out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.051" offset="4459604">So, without going into any curlicues about it, I would just advise Your Honors, that the Attorney General, Mr. Thurman Arnold, consented to an order signed by the Court saying that this might be done without violating the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.065" offset="4543613">So, there was there sanctioned in the clearest form, the creation of debt in a relatively huge amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.519" offset="4605471">Now, I'm come to 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.578" offset="4613726">I think that it is clear that the Attorney General has recognized what this decree has meant and has approved all this administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.196" offset="4688123">In 1957, at the time when the congressional committee was investigating the enforcement activities of the Department of Justice, the motion which started this proceeding was made by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.429" offset="4773073">It was denominated a motion to carry out the judgment and the Government selected a single company for the purpose, carefully selected quite clearly, the Arapahoe Pipe Line Company, a company which have been incorporated only three years or four which happened to have a very high debt ratio and undoubtedly thinking that they might not be so embarrassed with the new company as to this record of 16 years of administration they said that the Arapahoe Pipe Line Company was violating this decree by paying or at least crediting their shipper-owners with 7% of valuation without doing what the Government then suggested should be doing -- done making a deduction and now I'm going to practically quote verbatim what they said, “of making a deduction from valuation of that share of valuation attributable to the loans of third parties.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1279.096" offset="5219767">And in order to get that concept into the wording of the decree because the decree doesn't say a word about investment or a return on investment, that the slightest suggestion of it in words or thought in order to insert or insinuate that concept into the language of the decree, they seized upon this word “share” and said that there should be deducted from valuation, a share of valuation which they attributed to creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.445" offset="5389145">Now, that construction of the decree frankly has always been based upon what I call legerdemain with language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.776" offset="5450480">In their pleadings in the District Court and even in the reply brief, they post the problem as if the wording of this decree were not its share of 7% of the valuation but as if it were 7% of its share of the valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.767" offset="5574405">In other words, that share does not qualify 7% of its share qualifies valuation and by that transposition which is really the basis of the whole Government's case here, by that transposition of words they tried to impart the idea that what you should do is take a share of valuation, attributing a certain share of the creditors and a certain share to owners and then give the owners only 7% on its share.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.024" offset="5751515">Now, the reason for this transposition is quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.075" offset="5771682">It seems conceivable to the Government that there might be such a thing as a creditor share of valuation and that lawyers, drafting a decree, lawyers of experience, many of them representing the Government and the defendants might abuse the word “share of valuation”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.111" offset="5871783">To my mind, it's inconceivable that lawyers would speak about a creditor share of valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.450" offset="5901145">Creditors, of course, have a lien on probably everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.449" offset="5917132">They don't have a share of any problem and certainly, they don't have a share of a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.264" offset="5944404">That is the most formed thought to law one could suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.447" offset="5977109">But upon the assumption, that lawyers might speak of a share of valuation and then treating this decree as if they actually did speak of a share of valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.630" offset="6029876">They reach the conclusion that 7% of a share of valuation is 7% on the capital contribution of the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.753" offset="6094346">Now, the answer complete and conclusive is that there just isn't any such a wording in the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.811" offset="6134575">The lawyers didn't use that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.237" offset="6144293">They said each share of 7% of valuation and I submit that those words cannot be misunderstood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.628" offset="6201866">And so I'm suggesting to Your Honor, that the Government is not attempting to do what they suggested here originally, carry out this decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.508" offset="6245439">They're not even doing what they've said secondarily, they were attempting to do, which is to construe the decree because there is nothing to construe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.079" offset="6287653">This is an almost unabashed attempt to rewrite this decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.505" offset="6317432">And the District Court so observed it and in so many words said that he could not rewrite the decree which the parties agreed to in 1941 and which they interpreted by this amended order in 1942, in the Great Lakes case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.267" offset="6400397">Now, it's perfectly apparent by reading the Government's briefs here, particularly the reply brief that this is an attempt to rewrite the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.997" offset="6443342">Indeed that it is legislating in thought and effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.392" offset="6472913">It is addressed to minds who would be particularly interested in policy as to what should be pipeline administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.061" offset="6547623">For one thing, you will note that they have emphasized that all they intend to do here is something for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.543" offset="6577507">They are very careful to say that they couldn't possibly say that this decree has been violated over the last two decades.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.632" offset="6617945">Certainly, it would be unconscionable they recognize that, in view of their approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.205" offset="6640201">But they say to the future, legislatively, they want to make this decree over for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.075" offset="6675623">Secondly, they cite to Your Honors in an elaborate footnote, the report of the Royal Commission in Canada, charged with investigating the administration of energy in the dominion a policy body which started with the observation that pipelines were hardly regulated at all at Canada, said that there should be regulation of traffic and tolls, said that the pipeline shouldn't be constructed without a certificate of necessity and convenience which does not apply to pipeline construction here, anyone can construct a pipeline in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.295" offset="6868511">And then says as a matter of policy recommended, which Mr. Bicks says is a part of wisdom that the rate return should be based upon equity investment without leverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.166" offset="6964015">And the brief is otherwise largely beyond the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.635" offset="6989928">Now, if this Court with this late date were interested in framing a decree or in defining national or legislative policy in regard to pipelines, I can understand your being interested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.458" offset="7073207">But I suggest that these references have no place in this case or in this brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.299" offset="7116570">Now, the excuse for rewriting the decree is quite frank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.474" offset="7145305">It is based upon certain new theories of the application of the Elkins Act to the pipeline industry, and they say that this decree must be interpreted and by that they mean reframe to reflect what they regard to be the purpose of the Elkins --</text>

            <text syncTime="1924.429" offset="7801083">My observations on the subject were in response to Mr. Justice Stewart's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.917" offset="7839013">I would like to just mention in this connection, the decision of this Court in the Hughes case, Hughes versus United States written by Justice -- Mr. Justice Black for this Court in 342 U.S. 353 in which you will recall that the Government, to use the words of the Court, operating on a front broader than language seeking to serve what they consider to be the larger purpose of a bigger picture wanted to change the wording of a decree and this Court said in words very apt to this case, “the detailed plan of a decree may not be set aside as a matter of construction by ignoring language and looking to some larger purpose which is asserted.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.462" offset="8125210">Now, if I may, let me spend just a few minutes on these Elkins Act theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.317" offset="8156662">I think they are entirely beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.503" offset="8169409">I do believe that this case has been adequately covered to find me up to the moment as far as the problem before the Court goes but I do not want to neglect the Elkins Act theories which are now advanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.011" offset="8239417">These theories and why they have them, I don't know but I will state them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.778" offset="8258435">The basic theory seems to be that the normal method of financing a business, including any utility, should be denied to the pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.433" offset="8309112">They should not be able to borrow money to construct pipelines or if they do, they shouldn't be able to earn any money on either the money borrowed or the facilities so constructed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.120" offset="8383822">And then jumping over to their legal conclusion, they say just ipse dixit any return on borrowed money, any return on the facilities constructed with borrowed money as a matter of course becomes a rebate as a matter of law, must be so considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.670" offset="8482043">And therefore they say, that this decree must be interpreted consistent with that version of the Elkins Act to deny to the defendants any profit whatever on any facilities constructed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2139.431" offset="8661138">Now, of course, there's no law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.593" offset="8669706">There's no case to support such a theory and at the moment let me just call Your Honors' attention to what's perfectly obvious to my mind that the theories are economically untenable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.593" offset="8725713">I don't know what the earnings of the pipelines have been over these years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.840" offset="8746715">I wouldn't regard them as material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.613" offset="8765837">Appended to this brief, our figures, not in the record, for the year 1956 suggesting earnings in the terms of permissible dividends or actual dividends for that year of about 17% or 18%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.732" offset="8866252">I do not know why the year 1956 was selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.432" offset="8885060">I don't know anything about the accuracy of the table.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.889" offset="8902928">I'm not going to comment further beyond just saying one or two things which I happen to know and that is that the Humble Oil Company for example has not earned its 7% at anytime since the year 1944, that the Tuscarora company has not earned its 7% any year since 1946 and the Arapahoe Company which they talk about, all they paid out at anytime together is 1% on valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.184" offset="9044093">But sufficient through this point economically, that the suggestion that pipeline and the owners of pipelines should be limited in their return to 7% on their capital contribution is wholly unrealistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.171" offset="9124028">In the first place, it's unrealistic to talk about the “investment” of the shipper-owners and the pipelines as if their only investment was their capital contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.284" offset="9168541">That's almost the least of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.527" offset="9177527">Of course, their capital contribution is a foundation contribution but this isn't money put out of investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.674" offset="9206053">This is a business to which they give themselves in the planning, the designing, the building, the financing, the operating, the responsibility of management.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.562" offset="9257671">The capital that they put in it is -- is only one item.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.964" offset="9275225">And more than that, it has been quite the common practice for the owners to undertake to see that the debt which is incurred by the pipelines is repaid principal and interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.496" offset="9333321">Arapahoe for example, the company that they singled out, when they borrowed this large amount of money, it was under a throughput agreement in which the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company that loaned the money was assured not merely by Arapahoe but by the owners, Sinclair and Pure, that each intrastate, whether the pipeline was there or whether it wasn't there, whether it was earning money or whether it wasn't earning money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.342" offset="9436766">On each intrastate, that interest would be paid and in 15 years, the principal would be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.122" offset="9463829">And that's been quite commonly done, the investors in the pipelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.415" offset="9489011">I'll just digress for a moment to say that the reason that you find this pipeline picture of almost entirely oil company ownership is that no one else is interested in investing in a pipeline with the particular hazards of that business, hazards which have been pointed out by the Interstate Commerce Commission in their ratemaking cases over and over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.921" offset="9595068">The pipeline construction ownership and operation are a particularly hazardous venture for reasons which will occur to Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.974" offset="9643238">The pipes there, it can't be used for anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.623" offset="9653896">All it can transport is oil from an oil field to a -- a refinery in the case of crude and the oil field depletes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.815" offset="9690676">Other oil fields may come in, more accessible, more productive and in short time or long time, no one can say the asset is -- is wasted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.263" offset="9744384">No one wants to invest in a pipeline except in oil company as far as equity is concerned in operation and investors invest on ventures upon the assurance of the oil company owners behind them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.710" offset="9834245">Now, it's perfectly obvious that a 7% return on capital alone is no recognition of the contribution or the investment of the owners and that certainly, the oil companies would never have accepted the decree of any such terms, a word about the shipper and the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.748" offset="9950333">Rates which are reasonable come under the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission and the chairman, the then chairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission at the time that the congressional committee was in session, testified there and this was called to the District Court's attention that rates, pipeline rates had steadily declined from the year 1933 to the year 1948 that there had been no complaints whatever from shippers or anyone about pipeline rates being too high.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.892" offset="10114905">That the only complaints that they'd have about pipeline rates is from other competing carriers, water people, railroads and the like, the pipeline rates are too low.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.347" offset="10168717">An oil company, any oil company has complete freedom of the use of these pipelines, the same privilege as an owner, the same rates which were determined to be reasonable and without the necessity of making any investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.359" offset="10260773">Finally, I would suggest to Your Honors that the Government has wholly lost sight of the fact that there has been a settlement of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.666" offset="10314062">All these arguments, whatever you might say about them as a matter of merit and I have tried to indicate briefly why I think they have no merit, at least are inadmissible, I suggest, because this case was settled nearly two decades ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.258" offset="10416358">But I must pause for a moment to take exception to this adding to a brief, matters which are not in the record because it has an obvious vice and it's illustrated by one document which is referred to here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.189" offset="10508100">As a footnote in the brief, the Court has referred to a letter written by Mr. Chaffetz, counsel for Service Pipeline to the president of that company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.447" offset="10577168">The legend on when -- under which this letter is referred to is the indication that the Government believe that the investment concept had been adopted in the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.424" offset="10653027">And this letter is cited as proof of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.305" offset="10680613">The letter of March 29, 1950, refers to a position which was then indicated by a member of the staff of the Department of Justice an individual by the name of Snyder that at time it was doubtful whether the department was going to recognize new ICC valuations value written in this frame of reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.999" offset="10807359">During the war period, the ICC had suspended making a valuation of pipeline property so that for a period of years, the valuation employed under this decree was a rather an old valuation going back to 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.926" offset="10879039">After the war, they came back to making valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.719" offset="10898265">The first one as of the end of the year, 1947, they spent several years doing that, they didn't complete it until 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.280" offset="10932537">Since then, they've kept the valuations up to date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.859" offset="10946853">And the gentleman for the name of Snyder in the Department of Justice was casting some doubt as to whether the department was going to recognize the new valuation or whether it was going to try to insist upon a position that the decree throws the old valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.544" offset="11021563">Mr. Chaffetz had a conference with Mr. Snyder, and Mr. Snyder cast this doubt and in the course of a conversation he said that when the decree was negotiated, the department sought the limit permissible return to 7% on the shipper-owners investment and he said that was a discussion of putting in exhibit into that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.454" offset="11137233">According to him, at the industry's suggestion, valuation was substituted for investment and then he opined that they ought to stick to the old valuation instead of the new evaluation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.366" offset="11200867">So, the letter instead of supporting what it cited for of any idea upon the part of members of the department as to what this decree meant, it's' perfectly clear what it meant that while somebody may have had a notion back there in 1941, that investment would be a nice idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.734" offset="11274324">It certainly wasn't accepted and it wasn't incorporated in the decree, and I will finish this thought by referring to page 212 of this congressional record in which just completing the picture, that's all right on this point that Assistant Attorney General Bergson in charge of the Antitrust Division completed the question of what valuation should be used by saying explicitly the valuation has brought down the date from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.061" offset="11403577">So, there has been no question, and apart of the people in the department all these years as to what this decree meant and that's the importance of these 16 years of administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.126" offset="11459897">The Attorney Generals who have occupied this position and the gentlemen who have been in charge of the Antitrust Division have not been incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.162" offset="11500022">They've been able to understand this decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.704" offset="11514232">They've been duly conscientious, I think in the discharge of their responsibilities of enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.136" offset="11547878">I think they can be charged neither with neglect or dereliction of duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.315" offset="11568671">The importance of five Attorneys General and the heads of their antitrust departments over 16 years giving the same uniform interpretation to this decree is of the utmost significant namely, that this decree means what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.869" offset="11650800">Thank you, Court very much for your courtesy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2899.537" offset="11701478">Chief Justice and if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.123" offset="11715897">This is a proceeding as has been stated to carry out the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.961" offset="11735228">To carry out the decree as it was written in December 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.320" offset="11756648">It is not a proceeding to abandon, to modify or change the decree in any respect, but it is a motion to carry out the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.327" offset="11800639">And in further answer to Mr. Justice Stewart's question, of course a Court would have jurisdiction in fact, the Court in this case reserve jurisdiction to enforce the decree and in paragraph 10 they are -- they expressed the reserved jurisdiction to modify the decree, of course, upon proper motion being filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.623" offset="11889873">But that issue is not involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.324" offset="11904711">And of course, we would oppose any modification because we do not like a modification is justified under of any facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.916" offset="11947029">Now, I fear for the Great Lakes Pipeline Company which is one of the multiple ownership lines and it's the multiple ownership line that exemplifies and establishes the true meaning of the words as they appear in paragraph 3 of this decree on page 10, where it has said that no defendant common carrier shall give, grant, or pay to any shipper-owner in excess of its -- its share of 7 percentum of the valuation of such common carrier's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.623" offset="12109824">Now, what was the case with respect to Great Lakes Pipeline Company owned by eight shipper-owners, the Continental Oil Company owns 29%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.437" offset="12149112">The Mid-Continent Petroleum Corporation owns 19%, Phillips Petroleum Company 5%, Texas Company 12%, Pure Oil Company 8%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.327" offset="12192684">Each of those owners was not entitled for 7% of the valuation but each was entitled to its share of 7% of the valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.543" offset="12257573">And I submit to Your Honors that that's the reason that word “share” is in paragraph 3 of this decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.302" offset="12288606">Now, this is only one of the multiple ownership lines that was in existence in 1941 and that was a party to this decree and to this proceeding in 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.728" offset="12338239">There were 10 multiple ownership lines before the Court and it was essential that they placed the word “share” in this decree so that it would provide that each shipper-owner could not receive more than its share of the 7%, 29% of 7%, 19% of 7%, 5% of 7% or as the case would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.651" offset="12449938">Now, the Government tried in the trial court to say that share relate to valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.492" offset="12477315">Notwithstanding the fact that it immediately preceded 7%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.423" offset="12497063">Apparently, they have abandoned that position before Your Honors but we pointed out in the trial court as we do here that nothing is said in this decree about deducting indebtedness or property attributable to debt from valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.131" offset="12563937">But the decree expressly provides specifically and precisely what shall be deducted from debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.903" offset="12594970">It provides that the valuation should be the latest final valuation as established by the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.591" offset="12625690">And then it says there shall be conducted from that valuation depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.019" offset="12647424">There shall be deducted from that evaluation retirements from the property account and also at this frozen surplus this excess surplus if there is any is invested in additions to lines, it shall be taken out and excluded from the valuation, despite the fact that that's provided precisely as to what shall be deducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.963" offset="12731225">Nothing appears in this decree about deducting indebtedness or property attributable to debt from valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.030" offset="12763512">But it clearly provides that you shall take the valuation as established by the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.266" offset="12796426">Well, now they have more or less abandoned that argument and so they say, “Well, a creditor has a share of the 7% and the shipper-owners as a class have a share of the 7%.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.637" offset="12845955">But that's not what the decree says.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.971" offset="12855254">It speaks of each shipper-owner's share of the 7%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.812" offset="12874585">And further more, how could creditors have a share of the 7%?</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.969" offset="12895274">As the Government says, the permissible dividends or 7% of the valuation, creditors have no interest in dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.730" offset="12930278">Creditors can't share in dividends and both the Government and ourselves agree that the 7% states the limits as to what shall be the amount of the permissible dividends but creditors have no right to share in dividends and nothing is said in the decree about the creditors having any interest in the dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.197" offset="13032155">And furthermore, it does not refer to the shipper-owner as a class, but refers to each shipper-owner, and we submit that that language of the decree is clear on its face and just as a trial court said, it should be carried out on in accordance with the language and it's clear on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.445" offset="13113135">Now, this investment in the pipeline company, of course, is always carried out as a general rule by the -- by the oil companies themselves because they are the ones interested in getting their oil to the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.227" offset="13172276">Other invertors won't take the risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.006" offset="13183352">So when the Pure Oil Company and the Sinclair Company found oil out in Colorado, they became interested in building this Arapahoe Pipeline Company to Kansas City where it would connect with other lines and carry this oil to the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.438" offset="13245106">Other the investors weren't interested investing their money in that pipeline because the economic life for that pipeline was dependable in the oil reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.263" offset="13284394">There's various risk incident to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.305" offset="13296619">And furthermore, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company was not interested in loaning money to that pipeline company in the amount of $26 million until these two shipper-owners entered into a throughput agreement agreeing to ship and transport their oil through that pipeline to afford it sufficient cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.783" offset="13386480">But they'd not only agreed to -- entered into a proof of agreement, they also provided that if the transportation of oil did not furnish sufficient revenues and sufficient cash, these two shipper-owners will put up the cash to pay off all the current obligations and expenses of this pipeline company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.629" offset="13469863">They not only wrote, under wrote the debt in effect to the -- to the --of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, they under wrote the operating expenses of the pipeline company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.369" offset="13512808">And we respectfully submit Your Honors that this decree is clear on its face and that it should be enforced in accordance with this plain language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.183" offset="13556067">Thank you so very much for giving me this time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3374.270" offset="13600475">I would think that the basic disagreement between the United States and the defendant stands initially from certainty over the meaning of the word “its share”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.901" offset="13650944">The essence of the defendant's position as I understand it is that the word “its share” has been constantly and consistently understood by both parties as describing only the relation between groups, stockholders and not between the groups of investors more broadly, the relation between one stockholding and the total bundle of investors right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.901" offset="13746970">I'd like to -- on that point refer, a bit more specifically to the Great Lakes petition I think it's quite helpful on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.167" offset="13776018">The Great Lakes petition didn't deal with the problem of recurring dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.827" offset="13794722">It dealt with the problem as Mr. Judge Peck has accurately described with the capital or liquidating dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.871" offset="13814888">However in doing so, it did have occasion -- it did have occasion to define quite precisely rights as between shareholders the very problem, the very problem which defendants would now urge this Court the word “its share” beyond doubt clearly defines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.784" offset="13898480">However, when it came to defining that right, when it came to defining the relation between groups of stockholders, the Great Lakes petition did not use the word “share”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.463" offset="13945187">I think that is quite significant, that's one year after the decree was added and defendants argument is that its share was constantly understood and consistently understood to describe simply the relation between stockholders.</text>
