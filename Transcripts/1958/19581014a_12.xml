            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 12 Northwestern States Portland Cement Company versus State of Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.376" offset="144906">Mr. Maun.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph A. Maun</label>
            <text syncTime="17.178" offset="172074">Mr. Chief Justice, and members of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.455" offset="193181">This case involves that the validity of a portion of the Minnesota state income tax law under the provisions of the Commerce Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.323" offset="256711">Probable jurisdiction was noted by this Court on January 6th of this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.523" offset="281475">The appellant here is a cement manufacturer with his plant and place of business at Mason City, Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.280" offset="312508">It maintained one sales office in the State of Minnesota which was occupied under a lease and paid for out of Mason City.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.620" offset="349811">It owned no real estate in the State of Minnesota and its only personal property was such as was necessary to run the sales office, consisting of desk, two typewriters and some filing cabinets.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.752" offset="402369">Its salesmen had automobiles in the State of Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.349" offset="420760">The office consisted of two small rooms, some material, advertising material and that is all.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.923" offset="451062">During the years which are involved in this proceeding the appellant had at the most six employees and I say at the most because it extends over a period of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.357" offset="492753">Two of these employees and the secretary worked out of the Minneapolis office, the rest of the salesmen worked out of their homes throughout the State of Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.838" offset="534758">All employees were hired by supervisory personnel in Mason City, Iowa and no employee in the State of Minnesota had any authority to hire or fire any other employee or had anything whatever to do with the fixing of wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.866" offset="602885">The Minnesota office was used for the forwarding of orders that customers sent in and a place out of which the two salesmen in Minneapolis could work.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.281" offset="644472">These orders when they came into the Minneapolis office were transmitted directly to the Mason City office in Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.358" offset="676760">Credit extensions and collections were handled exclusively by the home office.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.289" offset="696508">No salesmen had any authority to handle such matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.331" offset="712704">All claims for adjustment were handled directly by the Mason City office.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.253" offset="732348">No employee in Minnesota had any authority to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.012" offset="751470">All cement was invoiced and by shipped by rail from the home office at Mason City directly to the purchasers who were located in the states of Iowa, Minnesota, North and South Dakota and Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.898" offset="810924">Price quotations were sent directly to the customers from the home office and all changes in price were authorized only by the Mason City office.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.944" offset="851153">Prices were quoted at the mill site, FOB Mason City, although the freight was added for the convenience of a customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.252" offset="892426">Now Minnesota has taken a position that part of the income earned by this taxpayer is taxable by Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.738" offset="922311">Upon Northwestern's refusal to file returns, the Commissioner of Taxation for the State of Minnesota prepared the returns himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.266" offset="956479">He prepared them for the years 1933 through 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.438" offset="977168">1933 was a year in which Minnesota adopted its income tax law.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.716" offset="1002245">When the taxpayer refused pay to these taxes disclosed by these returns, the state of Minnesota in 1953 commenced this action to collect these taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.651" offset="1049997">In preparing these returns, the Commissioner of Taxation used what is known as a three factor formula equally weighted, that is the ratio of the taxpayer's shipments into Minnesota, to its shipment replace or sales, the ratio of the taxpayer's property in Minnesota to its property everywhere, and the ratio of its wages paid in Minnesota to its wages everywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.222" offset="1152293">Now the income taxes, interest and penalties which were demanded as a taxpayer and which the trial court adjudged were payable for the years in question amount to somewhat over $100,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.783" offset="1214464">The Supreme Court of Minnesota in a five to two divided opinion upheld the action of the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.092" offset="1247692">Now the Minnesota income tax is what is sometime known as a second structured tax, there is two sections to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.452" offset="1277158">The first section provides that an excise tax shall be laid up on the privilege of the domestic corporations for the privilege of existing as a corporation for any part of a year and upon look -- foreign corporation doing a local business.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.776" offset="1350510">The second section or structure and that's the one we are involved here provides that there shall be an annual tax laid up on foreign corporations doing an interstate or foreign business within the state of Minnesota or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.431" offset="1421145">Now, the regulations promulgated by the Commissioner of Taxation for the State of Minnesota, under this particular act, provides flatly that the section requires the imposition of a tax upon the net income from interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.942" offset="1487182">There is no pretense that there is any local activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.682" offset="1502124">Had there had been any intrastate activities, this levy would have been made under the first structure of this tax, not the second.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.015" offset="1539427">Both taxes are measured in exactly the same manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.547" offset="1557608">The Minnesota Supreme Court held that the tax was not an excise tax, it was not a franchise tax, it was a not a privilege tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.884" offset="1598882">It said that it was a general income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.607" offset="1613824">It did not indirectly define what it meant by a general income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.575" offset="1645693">Now I'll address myself first perhaps to the due process aspect of this matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="390.700" offset="1666173">Before you go on may I ask this, (Inaudible) you said that Section 2 is invalid in its entirety and not because of its application to the particular fact of this case?</text>

            <text syncTime="403.849" offset="1718732">I say that this did not involve either personal question at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.418" offset="1733047">It's invalid in its entirety, as a direct tax upon interstate commerce.</text>

          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="450.927" stopTime="457.411">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="450.927" offset="1907127">Just that that is in the State of Iowa.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_a_maun" startTime="457.411" stopTime="1085.619">
            <label>Mr. Joseph A. Maun</label>
            <text syncTime="457.411" offset="1933040">It's in six states, I would say that again you get into Your Honor of whether or not you have the same deduction and that sort of thing, based on what the Minnesota law is, it wouldn't be true, and now Wisconsin we get into there and they don't permit a federal deduction, so we get into different concepts of what constitutes income, but based on the Minnesota formula Iowa does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.558" offset="2025618">Now first of all, as we probably know that due process may have a threefold impact on taxes of this nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.992" offset="2059368">First we get into the question of what we might call procedural due process of whether there can be in personam jurisdiction over this taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.353" offset="2104822">Now -- and then we get into the question of legislative jurisdiction over the subject matter of the tax and thirdly assuming those two aspects ever are satisfied, the question of whether there is due process in the apportionment factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.042" offset="2167515">Now we believe that in this case that Minnesota does have jurisdiction in personam over this taxpayer and that's not the issue before this Court, I think based on the International Shoe Company case against Washington where it provided that they needed only such notice as will satisfy the requirements of substantial justice, bearing fair play that there is jurisdiction as far as procedural jurisdiction over this taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.034" offset="2283499">We contend, however, if Minnesota does not have jurisdiction over the subject matter, so as to able it to impose a tax upon the income of this company, it would seem that if Minnesota does have jurisdiction over the subject matter, then probably we would never reach the question of whether this tax violates the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.343" offset="2376704">Although this Court has observed in some of it's prior decisions that the conceptions of due process in Commerce Clause is they related to validity of tax statutes, sometimes overlap, they are still not identical and we should sharply distinguish them.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.914" offset="2438980">It would certainly appear that Minnesota has any jurisdiction at all to tax here then it must be, because it can subject interstate commerce itself to income tax because that is the only subject matter within the boundaries of the State of Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.665" offset="2501987">Here the trial court itself followed that the only activities of this company carried on within the State of Minnesota were an integral part of interstate commerce and all of its revenues were produced from interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.381" offset="2568861">Now time and time again, this Court has said that the solicitation of orders, together with such acts as maybe in furtherance thereof does not provide the local incidence of operation, which ables a state to tax a foreign corporation, but should in all other respects stays at home.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.815" offset="2646601">The reason for this of course is that solicitation, is an essential ingredient of interstate commerce itself, and this fundamental concept of course was first pronounced by this Court in early case of Robbins against Shelby County Taxing District.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.104" offset="2711803">In more recent cases this question of due process of a state with relation to other kinds of taxes has risen many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.602" offset="2745762">In Miller Bros., the Court will remember against the State of Maryland, this Court stuck down the Maryland excise tax on the use, storage of consumptions of articles of commerce insofar as Maryland attempted to impose the responsibility of perfection.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.238" offset="2812322">It was in – and there the solicitation part took (Inaudible) of radio and newspaper advertising and this Court there pointed out that although its decisions were not always clear, and to the reason for the invalidity of these taxes, the principle remained that due process always required some definite link, some minimum connection between the state, the person, the property and the business, which it sought to impose a tax upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.893" offset="2934993">So we may ask ourselves here, what local incidents are taxable events in Minnesota?</text>
            <text syncTime="716.520" offset="2969475">This company ships 48% of its product into Minnesota and certainly if that fact is to become a basis or a subject matter of a tax, then a totally new concept would have been annunciated.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.384" offset="3028929">The theory of the Minnesota Supreme Court was that the volume of shipments was so substantial that such commerce in fact became localized, and thus separated from the free flow of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.459" offset="3077204">No attempt was made by that court to define the precise buy-in necessary to affect this localization.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.710" offset="3110222">In other words, under the theory, the Minnesota Supreme Court, the quantity of the shipment is critical.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.750" offset="3138330">However, this Court will notice as a matter of contrast, that in a case immediately to follow this one, the Georgia case, the State of Georgia argues that it's the quality of the connection between the state and the foreign corporation that is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.039" offset="3203532">And of course the reason the State of Georgia argues that is because in their case, less than 1% of that company's business was shipped in the state of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.647" offset="3241984">Now it would seem that neither quality nor quantity, nor regularity, could really turn interstate commerce into something that it actually is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.639" offset="3289945">Now under the decisions of this Court, had this taxpayer been engaged in some intrastate activity, then such activity in and of itself might have been used as a springboard upon which to base the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.931" offset="3347101">For instance, if this taxpayer had a plant in Minnesota there would be no problem of jurisdictional due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.503" offset="3377403">That was the situation in which this Court upheld levy in the Wisconsin income tax, in the case of the United States Glue Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.659" offset="3410004">There the taxpayer was a domiciliary of Wisconsin and it had a manufacturing plant there, and it did a large intrastate business.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.383" offset="3444903">The only question there was whether the statute violated the Commerce Clause, not the Due Process Clause because the substantive due process was well satisfied, and that is found in many of the cases of this Court, such as International Harvester against Evatt, Ford Motor Company against Beauchamp, West Publishing Company against McColgan, and Butler Brothers against the same Commissioner, but none of those cases was jurisdictional due process involved were there were local events.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.454" offset="3569142">Such cases are no different.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.686" offset="3582098">In those situations where this Court has time and time again upheld ad valorem property taxes, even though the property was used exclusively in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.310" offset="3628596">In every such instance, however, intrastate activities did exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.941" offset="3647091">Similar are those cases where gross earnings taxes upheld in lieu of an ad valorem property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.932" offset="3679065">Now in Shaffer against Carter, the right of the State of Oklahoma to tax the income of a non-resident from business carried on in Oklahoma was upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.770" offset="3726503">In doing so this Court reaffirmed the doctrine, first pronounced by Justice Brewster in the Michigan Central Railroad Company case, that the only possible subjects of any tense, are persons, property and business.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.607" offset="3785749">In the Miller Bros. case this Court again reaffirmed that principal and necessarily then the power of taxation, from a substantive jurisdictional standpoint is limited to those three subject matters, persons, property and business.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.103" offset="3859832">The Oklahoma tax upon a non-resident was upheld because the business was in Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.068" offset="3883656">Under on the same theory this Court has upheld tax levied on rental income received from real estate by a New York resident, even though the real estate was located with -- out of the state of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.674" offset="3938095">There again the subject matter was the privilege or domiciled residents of the person.</text>

            <text syncTime="984.276" offset="4040495">The reason for it is that the subject matter of the tax was within the State of Mississippi, and in answer to Chief Justice's question, Iowa under that case could impose a tax because it's a domiciliary state upon 100% of income of this company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.487" offset="4113324">But the tax in those cases is not upon income as the subject matter, it is upon the subject matter and it is measured by the income.</text>

            <text syncTime="1044.182" offset="4280090">Now in the Shaffer case the subject matter was said to persons, property and business.</text>

            <text syncTime="1588.670" offset="6458075">Now sometimes when it comes to analyzing an income tax, we will sometimes lose sight of the distinction between the question of the basis of the tax and the measure of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.222" offset="6520247">And sometimes some courts have had the tendency to discuss what I think is the equitable nature of the tax and thus neglect the real question which is whether or not the subject matter of the tax itself is within the states' grasp.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.998" offset="6587329">Exemplifying I think this type of tax is a comparison between the ad valorem real property tax which is levied on real estate as a subject, but still measured by the real estates' value and on other hand a gross earnings tax on a utilities' gross earnings as a measure, but the tax is actually on the property we'll get within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.227" offset="6684296">Now what's seen in this type of case that it would be impossible with regard to income in and of itself as a subject rather than a measure of a tax?</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.397" offset="6724942">Now the reason for this is that income is merely an abstraction which is arrived at by pre-described mathematical means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.341" offset="6760782">It is an artificial norm which provides a measure, but which by reason of its abstract character cannot logically provide a foundation or the subject matter of tax itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.333" offset="6816684">Now most state taxes are well grounded from this stand point because normally they are up on the residences or up on the domestic aided corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.979" offset="6859316">And the result of that at sometimes have led some courts to assume that so long as the income tax is fairly apportioned, it can be applied with respect to any income which the state directs the tax at even though there's not a proper subject matter within the state to ascertain that tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.705" offset="6942177">And it's for this reason that judicial reference to local activities or intrastate activities has reached a paramount significance of income tax cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.975" offset="6987316">A search for a local activity represents a proper (Inaudible) such as a search for the primer essential to tax, namely a subject matter within the territorial jurisdiction of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.490" offset="7049383">Now a law, if even -- if we could look at this case from a stand point of an equitable basis and ignore for a moment the tremendous upsetting impact, if these taxes could be leveraged by every state in the (Inaudible) we might ask what benefits have been sort afforded this tax, they're equitable entitled to this tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="1800.944" offset="7307160">I think this case, the facts of this case bring it squarely within the decision of the Alpha Portland Cement Company case and as a matter of fact, as you read this record, it will be clear that Northwestern patterns it's business practices, so come exactly within the Alpha case and there this Court held as a matter of due process, a state may not tax property beyond its borders under the guise of taxing intrastate business, of activities carried on by Alpha in Massachusetts were greater than those here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.664" offset="7442056">Alpha had a bank account in Massachusetts, there was none in Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.839" offset="7462745">Alpha solicitors made collections, Northwestern's do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.738" offset="7482284">Alpha solicitors ordinarily took orders and forwarded them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.413" offset="7497017">Northwestern's normally do not, they go around and they are goodwill missionaries and the orders normally go directly into the office of the company at Mason City for acceptance or rejection, the same as one aspect or element of the Northern case in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.339" offset="7568697">Now it has been suggested by some that each activity in interstate commerce is a taxable event, and taxes multiply only in the sense that each state taxes that which occurs within its own borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.681" offset="7626062">The argument is then advanced that a tax by more than one state is not upon the same activity and therefore it's valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.155" offset="7655946">If that theory is to be followed, Minnesota is free exact the tax because of solicitation, then other states to which any such commerce extends may with people rightly, of any tax on any activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.307" offset="7708609">If solicitation of sales such as separate activity, it would seem to follow that sending out of agents to make purchases of raw materials would be just as much as separate activity to many commercial concerns and then take this purchase of raw materials is much more important than the sales of product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.402" offset="7788962">In our own state of Minnesota where our rich beams of iron ore are -- host of cheap water transportation are fast disappearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.812" offset="7818637">That raw material is much more important than the question of finding a market for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.469" offset="7849253">Certainly it must be conceded that each activity in interstate commerce is a perquisite to the final result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.501" offset="7881331">Solicitation is only one of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.318" offset="7892616">There is no more justification for singling out that activity as a taxable event, than it is for separating out the natural gas that is absolutely necessary the fuel with which to produce the tremendous heat that is necessary to make this cement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.658" offset="7961997">Acquisition of that gas from Texas as well these had to be a separate activity of solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.845" offset="7990732">It is more essential and by far more regular and more continuous for it is used 24 hours a day, seven day a week, everyday of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.010" offset="8043395">Now the argument has been made that the taxing of a business twice is no difference than doubling the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.548" offset="8073592">In other words, if this company is taxed in Iowa, and taxed in Minnesota, it is no different than if Iowa doubled the rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.543" offset="8105566">This does not necessarily follow for the rate is doubled for intrastate business just as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.517" offset="8133465">The intrastate merchant has other safeguards.</text>

            <text syncTime="2067.638" offset="8373896">Now we all recognize of course that in adopting the constitution these states gave up certain aspects of their sovereignty in certain specified areas and that was to regulate commerce and the power was given to this Court (Inaudible) national legislation to see whether there was a burden or interference with interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.022" offset="8467414">And in addition when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, the states further relinquished another portion of their sovereignty by the virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that was the right for them to determine themselves whether a tax such as this and in many other fields overlaps so as to interfere with our national welfare and harmony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.128" offset="8547871">Now the proper limitation under the Fourteenth Amendment of the exercising of the tax sovereignty of the states to subjects within their jurisdiction is as vital to the political and economic harmony of this union, as are the restrictions on state sovereignty imposed by the other sections of the constitution, including the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.955" offset="8639195">Well this Court will be continued to be guided by the principle that interstate commerce in and of itself does not constitute a jurisdictionally sound subject matter upon which to base an income tax from a due process standard will not deprive the state of their revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.344" offset="8700740">This Court has in prior decisions chartered a course under which states can impose a tax even upon corporations carrying on interstate commerce activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.988" offset="8739297">Where there are intrastate activities itself they can use that as a springboard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.958" offset="8759254">The states should not either through their clamor for more revenues or any theory of alleged state rights be permitted to destroy the area of free trade that Commerce Clause sort to create.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.419" offset="8813066">We recognize that interstate commerce must pay its way, but it does pay its way and it has long been a -- certainly a well established rule by this Court that a state may not impose a charge for the enjoyment of a right granted by the federal constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.978" offset="8875238">This Court unanimously held so in Murdock against the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania where they refused to allow the license tax for the privilege of exercise of a religion on a theory that was a right granted by the federal constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.804" offset="8938559">Now the argument has been advanced that if Minnesota is not permitted to impose this tax, intrastate commerce will act as a disadvantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.917" offset="8978996">Well that's not true, because under the Lawrence case Iowa can tax 100% of this income, the same as Minnesota can tax 100% of income of companies domiciled there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.675" offset="9026121">And this taxpayer pays all the local taxes to Iowa that Minnesota corporations pay to Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.519" offset="9053497">And under the series of cases which this Court handed down in the used tax cases and the sales tax cases, Minnesota could have imposed a used tax on the sale of cement in the state of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.654" offset="9098010">And had it done so it would have received over this period of years over half a million dollars rather than the amount of which it's seeking in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.853" offset="9138761">Now merely because Minnesota does not want to follow that constitutional avenue of taxation there is no reason why this Court should extend it a helping hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.316" offset="9184632">And Minnesota like California in its brief filed amicus here cannot claim that this is a substantial source of its revenue, because it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.221" offset="9224234">Minnesota would not expect a decision either if someone had you believe that brought about the resistance to this type of taxation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2317.871" offset="9374908">So the states haven't been relying on this and the Court will notice in supplemental record filed by the Stockham case today, the Commissioner of the State of California said that this type of income being taxed by the State of California would produce about $600,000 a year out of $210 million or one-fourth or 1% of its total tax revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.233" offset="9508342">So it is not the type of tax these states have relied upon for any of the revenues whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.566" offset="9529657">They haven't enforced it, and at this late stage to enforce this type of tax will create chaos among companies doing business in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.791" offset="9566542">And it's not the type of the company like a General Motors or the Ford Motor Company or General Electric that is going to be bothered if this Court upholds this kind of tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.227" offset="9600293">It's a small company, doing business in one or two or three states.</text>

            <text syncTime="2473.944" offset="9999130">The corporation concern here is in the State of Minnesota concededly for one purpose, to make money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.167" offset="10032044">Its activity is selling cement manufactured in Iowa to persons who buy the cement in Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.733" offset="10066317">Although these activities are all an integral part of interstate commerce, some of these activities are something more than that are outside of the usual idea of the flow of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.108" offset="10127757">The corporation has salesmen who in addition to soliciting orders from perspective purchasers from the corporation contact the ultimate users of the product, architects those people who will be buying the product that cannot buy from the corporation and they quote to these people, pricing in the same manner that they quote to the dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.965" offset="10243218">They're driving for one thing of course, to enlarge the volume of their business that is by encouraging sales by their dealers who handle the products.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.882" offset="10286895">This is specifically the sort of activity which in Northwestern Milling Consolidated Corporation, Northwestern Consolidated Milling Corporation versus Massachusetts reported in Cheney Brothers Company versus Massachusetts was held sufficient to sustain a tax and the privilege of doing a local business.</text>
