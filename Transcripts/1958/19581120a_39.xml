            <text syncTime="16.254" offset="168417">Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.154" offset="192031">This case is a very simple one on the facts that has very complex, indeed very deep current certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.075" offset="239679">Actually, it is an action for debt, originates an action for debt by a trader, Hugh Lee on the Lee Trading Post Ganado, Arizona, in the middle of the Navajo Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.822" offset="310627">And the defendants are two Navajos, husband and wife whose flock of sheep was attached for the purpose of collecting a debt of $361.22.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.256" offset="376351">After some delay in holding the sheep at the plaintiff's trading post where they were carried for and at a per diem charge, they were finally sold to sheriff's sale for a total sum including $2 in cash, but the plaintiff, for some reason, put up $272, the total cost of maintaining the sheep during their incarceration, shall we say, was $246.72.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.090" offset="503724">So that had the plaintiff not paid in cash in his anxiety over this case the sum of $280, there would have been a net balance to credit on this debt of $27.28 and had the -- I cannot refrain from commenting in passing that had the jurisdiction of the Court in respect to this particular point then maintained, he could then have attached another flock of sheep and repeated the process calling up on the debt of this proof presumably at the rate of $27 or $30 in attachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.307" offset="648652">Now, actually, with the payment of cash, the final judgment was $82.22 which is still standing against these -- these defendants and therefore other property can be -- be attached for reasons explained in the course of my discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.675" offset="718033">The Supreme Court of Arizona held that that attachment was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.622" offset="741857">In fact, in the Superior Court proceedings below beginning there, the Superior Court judge, when the defendants challenged the jurisdiction of the Court proceeding this matter, held that having obtained the citizenship, they were subject to the state jurisdiction, I need not to spell out Superior Court's ruling anymore than that perhaps under the issues in the Supreme Court, where, on appeal, the Supreme Court of Arizona sustained these views.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.387" offset="892949">However, it reversed the District Court -- the -- the Superior Court on the -- in respect to the attachment on the grounds and for the reason that a specific regulation of the Bureau of -- of the Department of Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs forbad the sale of livestock without a -- an expressed permit by the superintendent.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.792" offset="998588">In this area, the federal regulations, the Supreme Court of Arizona held did in fact preempted appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.918" offset="1027009">And therefore, the attachment was invalidated.</text>

            <text syncTime="359.893" offset="1542980">On the broader ground that a regulation controlling the credits -- controlling the transaction between traders and Indians on the Reservation specifically provided that if credit is extended, it should be at the traders' own risk.</text>

            <text syncTime="399.941" offset="1703163">But on this narrower ground, that the credit provisions of the traders' regulations left the traders entirely at their own risk and made the transaction unenforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.088" offset="1755721">The Court said that the only thing before it was the question of jurisdiction and that the effect of this regulation went to the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="485.168" offset="2044008">First, our main contention and the one consonant with a long line of decisions from Worcester against -- from the Worcester case in -- against Georgia in -- in 5 Peters down through many, many years that the Court -- that no jurisdiction of the persons but had by the state court because they are Navajo -- Navajo Indians residing on the Navajo Reservation and because the State does not, broadly speaking, have civil or criminal jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="917.204" offset="3772165">But it's perfectly clear by the doctrines of this Court, reviewed in our brief, that there is no civil or criminal jurisdiction until Congress has granted it, except, I must make a qualification as you think I'm painting a black and white picture and a ridiculous one, there are incidents to territorial sovereignty of the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="1016.630" offset="4169853">I would there to contend the Navajos have denied access to this Reservation and you can't come on, but the general law is the contrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1995.845" offset="8086758">That was amended in 1950 to extend it to criminal jurisdiction so that the courts of New York then had jurisdiction over all of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.292" offset="8132524">In 1953, there was the general -- a general act extending specifically to five States, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oregon, Wisconsin and California extending civil and criminal jurisdiction of those States over Indian reservations within those States over an Indian country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.835" offset="8226670">Now, Section 6 and 7 of that Act is pertinent to our case because Section 6 and 7 said that consent is given to the people of any State to amend the Constitution or statutes to remove impediment to civil and criminal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.482" offset="8297305">This impediment exists in Arizona in the Constitution.</text>
