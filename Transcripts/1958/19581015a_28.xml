            <text syncTime="16.422" offset="169044">-- may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.588" offset="185762">This was an action of law commenced in an Iowa state court upon what is commonly denominated an interim contract of interim insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.873" offset="242813">It appears at page 17 of the record, that is a photostatic copy of what was delivered by the defendant insurance company to Max W. Hinkle.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.852" offset="318777">The unfortunate thing happened that he took out this insurance and paid the first premium on a Friday morning, the 25th February and the next day he was killed by the crashing of his airplane.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.230" offset="380322">Our contention is that this was a binding contract of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.746" offset="402369">That all the conditions occurred, that the matter of doing business here by this matter, they induced him or led him to believe that he was insured when he paid this premium and that under the decisions of the Supreme Court of Iowa, it is against the public policy of Iowa or any court, either the Iowa courts or any other court to assist an insurance company from evading that liability when they -- Iowa has said that by the -- the fact that they are charging him a premium over that interm, that if they don't have to pay it is unpaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.389" offset="600900">Now our chief complaint against the Court of Appeals is that they decided this case by numerous decisions other than from Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.201" offset="640188">They did mention and cite the Reynolds case that we cite in our brief and I have cited it to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.158" offset="667982">They stated what the court said in that case, then they took a large number of cases, mostly cases from states where the fact I'm going to call your attention to, the most essential fact did not exist and then said by interpreting this Iowa case, in the light of this -- these other cases that there should have been a verdict directed for the insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.644" offset="761919">So the real question in the case, it's not a case of who should recover and who shouldn't, it's a case of whether or not the court should have directed a verdict for the insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.160" offset="807999">The trial court overruled the motion of the defendants for directed verdict, submitted to the jury and under his instructions the jury found for the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.209" offset="856168">Now it's immaterial, nobody took any exceptions to these instructions, I didn't and they didn't.</text>

            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="193.651" offset="878007">(Inaudible) lawyer and the Court of Appeals who wrote this opinion was an Iowa lawyer, is that right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leland_s_forrest" startTime="200.712" stopTime="324.922">
            <label>Mr. Leland S. Forrest</label>
            <text syncTime="200.712" offset="906219">That is where I made my mistake in the oral argument and of course that did create I think considerable prejudice in the part of the Iowa judge against the man from the Missouri and I think that is one of the reasons I claim it wasn't due process of law, because then when you emphasis the fact where the judge came from, then you haven't got due process of law, but (Inaudible) prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.803" offset="998588">And I might say however that the gentlemen, if you gentlemen set up there from Kansas City, you probably know him better than I do, was one of the most brilliant men and you didn't have to hit him over the head with the case to get him to see it, he was usually two jumps ahead of you.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.695" offset="1074134">And my contention is that don't make any difference where the judge came from, there isn't any judge in Iowa that would have sustained the motion for a directed verdict in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.610" offset="1129827">Now if you look at that, in the first place they have written in there the word immediate coverage in ink in addition to what they printed, and here is what they printed, the insurance applied for shall be in full force and effect from this date, provided the proposed insured is now in good health, notwithstanding any change of the proposed insured's health or condition due to disease hereafter acquired or to any subsequent causality.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.653" offset="1234004">Now by the time the average man and I'm going to refer to the Judge Hand's opinion in the Second Circuit obviously, by the time the average man reads through the sentence the rest of it is he is confused.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.163" offset="1284054">It took the court -- Judge (Inaudible), it took him 20 some pages with briefs and weighted authority to convince himself that this meant what he said would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.202" offset="1336195">Now if you refer to Judge Hand's opinion, he says in the Second Circuit, that these things are to be interpreted not like an insurance adjuster, an insurance underwriter would interpret it, that it be interpreted the way the average man would interpret.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="324.922" offset="1403068">Would you think that Judge Hand was an average man?</text>

            <label>Mr. Leland S. Forrest</label>
            <text syncTime="328.021" offset="1415502">No, but he didn't do this which the Court of Appeals did.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.612" offset="1425847">He doesn't write his knowledge of insurance business into the opinions and make an expert witness out of himself subconsciously.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.448" offset="1457194">Now that's what he was saying I think, that no judge, no matter how much he knows about insurance, should not write his knowledge of the insurance business into a contract and thereby read his knowledge in there as if he were an expert witness, and that's what I claim, the Court of Appeal's statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.252" offset="1536397">They took review of that -- they took their knowledge of a -- of the insurance underwriter and they said this conclusively shows that he wasn't insurable, but the only way they could do it under not here, but they didn't say it was insurable, but not insurable under the underwriting rules and practices of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.369" offset="1652799">Now they did put in evidence some of their underwriting rules and practices, now that was over by objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.470" offset="1669204">Now here is what is actually happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.992" offset="1687385">They introduced parole evidence over my objection to vary the terms of this contract and your judge, he knew his evidence law, because I objected that it was varying the pro tanto.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.301" offset="1744541">He says I'll let it in but I can take care of it on the instructions which is just another way of saying the parole evidence rule is rule of substantive law, so what difference does it make (Inaudible), as long as I take it out from the (Inaudible), and that's the only evidence a judge take out, and my understanding (Inaudible) and tell the jury not to consider it is what violate the parole evidence rule because parole evidence rule (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="434.573" offset="1841716">Now words of this can't goose out of a turkey but from goose â€“ turkey to goose and now let me call your attention to the most important Iowa decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.120" offset="1883826">I made a mistake in the case you mentioned, because I assumed as you hinted I should assume that the Iowa judge knew the Iowa law.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.234" offset="1936280">Now I don't dispute he does, he knows it, but he knows it the way he thinks it ought to be, he doesn't know it the way the Supreme Court of Iowa says it is, and here is what the Supreme Court of Iowa said, and this is the case the Court of Appeals refused to read, of course I asked him to read it, and they wrote in the opinion and said it's unnecessary to pass on that question because we hold that the it doesn't make any difference where the agent had the authority or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.624" offset="2029902">Now he was about to say it and I read it for two reasons, one because I think under your Erie rule the Court of Appeals was bound by it and the second it's effect duration of the policy of Iowa, as to what is good public policy and whenever the Court of Iowa says that the thing is not good public policy then if an Iowa Court goes in to defeat that public policy, it isn't just right.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.321" offset="2124675">Now let me read what it says, this is a quote, "Where the policy covers the risk from the date of the application."</text>

            <label>Mr. Leland S. Forrest</label>
            <text syncTime="533.869" offset="2238882">It's in my brief and I haven't proffered this in the brief, but I want to read it because for the very thing that they said, they presumed that this Iowa judge knows the Iowa law and I'm sure he does, but he doesn't know it the same way the Supreme Court of Iowa knows.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.507" offset="2293426">It is apparent that the insured pays for insurance for the stipulated period beginning with the application, not the date of its acceptance.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.300" offset="2336580">No one would be expected to take out insurance for a period of time that had already lapsed, but unless there is a preliminary contract of insurance covering the time between the making of the application and its acceptance or rejection, that is what every insured who received such a policy is required to do, but just the injustice of saying that on the acceptance of the application, the insured has had protection from the prior date where no loss occurs, where it is also said, that there is -- and that he is not protected, if a loss did occur, is plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.385" offset="2500942">In other words, they declared the public policy of Iowa that if they are collecting a premium, that is going to date the policy prior, back to the application then if he, when he dies -- when he gets insurance of course sure he wasn't insured, or if he is still alive, then they charge him and begin to collect the premium as the date of his application, not the date of his policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.901" offset="2594983">So Iowa says there's scheme for doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.217" offset="2608253">The injustice of it is plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.135" offset="2619956">Now when I, my contention that when the Supreme Court of Iowa declares a public policy of Iowa of what is an injustice and then some, if he is not a judge that sits on the Federal Court, when he sits on the bench and you just hit the decision as a Federal Judge to produce the very injustice that the Iowa court has denounced it against its public policy, he is certainly not following the Erie rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.833" offset="2714728">I think Erie rule as I understand it they are supposed to get the same results that an Iowa would get.</text>

            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="657.455" offset="2733223">You said in this situation the man pays the premium he gets in every case of term insurance.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leland S. Forrest</label>
            <text syncTime="663.620" offset="2757883">No I don't -- it depends on how they worded their application and their policy, but their idea here was that well I mean read their own evidence, he says in here that I am a State Director, so I am naturally State of (Inaudible) wherever it comes.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.372" offset="2824861">Turn over on next page to Page 20 is the fact of this application and that is the very thing -- it was on the application in the (Inaudible) case.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.068" offset="2875643">If the premium is paid on the date the application is signed the policy will usually bear that date it's issued as applied for.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.311" offset="2916603">In other words they told him right there and they told the agent, we are going to date this policy, the date of the application, not the date we issue the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.980" offset="2955264">Now I didn't discover that, I didn't know it was there I have to try, so I thought that I have to prove that fact by cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.163" offset="2996015">So I asked the Vice President of the company who testified in his evidence I think is on Page 47 on that, I asked him, if you had issued a policy in this case what would have been the due date of the premium, the date of the policy or the date of the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.674" offset="3078040">He said the date of the application, and I asking if that was in their usual practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.754" offset="3098415">And he said no, not always but that would have been the practice in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.799" offset="3114611">In other words they have gotten up a scheme or a contract which if you read the defendant opinion, I think you get, it's clear in (Inaudible) by which day or time that agent sells, in the competition of selling insurance where they wanted induce the man to take out insurance right now and pay the premium and if you will, they will make his insurance effective immediately and that's what they tell him.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.649" offset="3238013">Now after they tell him that of course and they take his money, then they hand him these receipts and of course receipts (Inaudible) court.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.857" offset="3282840">Now that in -- this case is in conflict when these two Iowa cases that I have cited the Reynolds case and this (Inaudible) case.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.891" offset="3326934">Now let me explain about the (Inaudible) case.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.226" offset="3336234">This (Inaudible) case was a fire insurance policy and the argument was whether or not the agent had the authority to make that effective immediately or wait until he delivered the files.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.057" offset="3391613">They had good enough evidence in that case, his contract with the insurance company which said, expressly that the agent did not have that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.944" offset="3435186">The Supreme Court of Iowa says, irrespective of what you put in there if -- and they said this what I quoted here, if they are charging a premium over that time or fixing it so when they issued the policy they have the authority to charge a premium over that time then the -- and because of the injustice of such a situation I think they should have said they are going to stop to deny his authority, but they didn't say that, they went farther than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.265" offset="3540407">They said he had apparent authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.292" offset="3556498">Now if he had apparent authority there is only one way that it could have appeared to the insured that he had authority and that is that he has authority to tell the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.543" offset="3601533">The Iowa case says the reason he had apparent authority to promise immediate coverage is because the charging the premium under the Iowa law there was as immediate coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.802" offset="3638627">And if there's immediate coverage the reason, he ain't got apparent authority to tell the truth and that's I think what that case means.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.723" offset="3666213">But it does make any difference in every case, well there are the two actually, and they're -- that is they don't have a new rules, that what they are doing is saying that whenever this situation arises, there -- a mere effect that they are charging that premium means as a manner of public policy in Iowa whether they claim to have no authority or whatever they claim they are lying.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.177" offset="3792123">And I think you could even say that they have a case actually interprets or construes that collecting that premium simply impose a liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.982" offset="3831306">Now they haven't used it and in this, insured in this agency case.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.610" offset="3849801">They did finish up and said we do not mean to hold here necessarily, that we are imposing our liability, but they didn't say, we are not I think that they mean next time don't argue about authority, come up here and claim this as an imposed liability and we'll hold (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="951.970" offset="3911241">But anyhow whatever you take it, in every case, it's a declaration of the public policy of Iowa and that's (Inaudible) shall we give a signal and I want to reserve the rest of the time to rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.238" offset="3968293">Don't ever you forget on the (Inaudible)</text>

            <label>Mr. Phineas M. Henry</label>
            <text syncTime="976.215" offset="4008208">Chief Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.326" offset="4024717">I am not familiar with whether or not Your Honors have had any provision â€“ (Inaudible) about this case but if you haven't I am sure that you don't know anything about the facts of it by misstatement of opposing counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.821" offset="4090650">The receipt is what is called a conditional receipt and it contains not only the proviso which he read, but a second proviso, first proviso that he'll be in good health and second that he furnish evidence of his insurance -- satisfactory evidence of his insurability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.785" offset="4182497">This was on a priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.395" offset="4204962">An arrangement the -- after the application had been signed the agent said, when can you take the medical examination and he said that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.351" offset="4244773">There is some slight conflict about whether this was forenoon, or afternoon or who called the doctor, but any how they, in his presence they called the doctor and they arranged that the examination be held that day and then the applicant said stop I've got to be away, I'm going away and they arranged to have it on Monday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.791" offset="4322513">Then he signed up the application and in the application in answer to the question there is a proposed insured plan to make him fly as trainee pilot or a crew member or has he made such flights in ten years, he said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.174" offset="4380087">As flying (Inaudible) as his flying time -- well this is above (Inaudible) he said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.153" offset="4423973">Beyond an air plane he had been flying for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.449" offset="4437138">He flew every Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.828" offset="4446647">He went out the next day and was killed in his plane.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.568" offset="4461693">Before there ever had been a medical examination, a check has been given to the first premium and that check after being held for sometime pending an examination by some other attorneys was never cashed and was returned to the applicant, to his widow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.833" offset="4526686">And a suit was brought on the theory that there is, on two first count was that the receipt in itself was a temporary contract of insurance and the second was that if there was any requirement for a medical examination that has been waived or excused by the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.317" offset="4604635">Now just a word about a conditional receipt, the great cry is that a conditional receipt is an engine of fraud because it lures a man into thinking he has been insured when he hasn't been.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.509" offset="4665448">There are several kinds of conditional receipts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.440" offset="4673181">There is an exhaustive note in 2ALR second which is referred to in the Circuit Court's appeals opinion in which they list various categories of conditional receipts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.528" offset="4721455">Some of them are conditioned upon the approval of application at the home office of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.611" offset="4749772">Some are conditioned upon the issuance of the policy or delivery the policy and some of them as this one condition upon the insurability of the applicant and Judge Hand in the (Inaudible) case referred to that form a receipt as being a more favorable to the applicant than any other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.726" offset="4838275">Now what does the applicant get?</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.603" offset="4853739">Assuming that the applicant passes his medical examination and there is no other outside evidence with regards to his habits, occupations, the family history and so forth, the (Inaudible) uninsurable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.056" offset="4915597">The -- he is covered from that date regardless of whether his death occurs before the application reaches the home office of the company or before a policy is issued, but the point that I want to emphasize here and the point that is made in the cases where there have recovery, is that this conditional receipt is meant to protect an insurable applicant and not an applicant who is uninsurable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.717" offset="5042239">Now the testimony here was that this man was not insurable for the plan and rate applied for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.635" offset="5089886">To go back again to explain a little bit more about it, because that's was when -- this is what is called an increasing term policy, and it starts out at $10,500 which is a small unit issued, and then the amount is reduced $500 a year and the purpose of it was to protect people who are -- have mortgages on their homes, on which they are paying an installment payment so that as the amount of the mortgage goes down, the amount of the insurance goes down, but in any event the insurance protects the man from his decreasing death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.509" offset="5225409">Then there is in the record a showing that if a man says that he is engaged in aviation, they give him what is called an aviation questionnaire in which he recites whether he owns a plane or whether he is a pilot, how many hours he has flown and so forth, and then at the bottom of that aviation questionnaire as shown in the record on page 43 is a notice to the agent asking him if the insured wants to be covered with an aviation limitation, that is to say that if the insured is killed while flying as a pilot, the premium will be returned, or the (Inaudible) or wants to pay an extra premium, which in this case it would have been $3.75 a thousand and he is given the opportunity to do that and if he wants to pay the aviation -- if he wants to have the aviation exclusion cause, he has had it right down there, a writer to his policy which appears in the record on page 44, which he signs and which agrees that if he is killed, while acting a pilot, or officer or member of the crew, the company's liability is limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.672" offset="5526026">Now the agent testified that this man said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.538" offset="5549537">The petitioner claims that this answer no was written in by the agent after he left.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.183" offset="5584123">Well, now the agent swore, definitely you could say so, a woman was there, who was a clerk around there and she said that she was there, but she didn't pay any particular attention until they called up the doctor on the telephone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.966" offset="5643264">The insurer says over his signature which contains his answers, the foregoing information is true and complete and is correctly recorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.849" offset="5690807">Now if he had told the agent that he was a flier, that would have been -- he would have been given the opportunity to either sign the aviation amendment or to pay an extra premium, as he didn't of course nothing was known about that, but the record shows that in cases of this kind an investigation is made for the retail credit company and as everybody in the office says that they knew he was a pilot and that would have undoubtedly been disclosed and there again he would have been given the opportunity to have the aviation exclusion clause or the -- pay the extra premium, but the policy would not have been issued as applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.570" offset="5877635">He was not insurable for the plan rating applied for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.619" offset="5893831">He was eligible for insurance and Mr. Forrest says that the agent -- that the agency vice -- the underwriting Vice President of the company said that he was insurable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.489" offset="5945344">He said and I'm sorry to say there is a slight (Inaudible) where he is quoted in the brief on page 12, the word any appears as in by the bench, but this is what he said, "If Mr. Hinkle's aviation record had been disclosed in the aviation questionnaire, a policy would not have issued (Inaudible) extra rating or without the limit of the aviation coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.367" offset="6036877">If a man owns an airplane and answers the questions regarding aviation any further, he would be eligible for every plan of insurance we have, with either an aviation exclusion clause or an extra premium."</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.095" offset="6091734">Now that's all that was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.464" offset="6109184">Now it's so happens that one of the leading cases on conditional receipt is Reynolds case in our (Inaudible) and I will remind Your Honors, what was suggested by the Judge Whitaker that in three, not the two recent cases, not too old cases, Ragan against Merchants Transfer &amp; Warehouse Company, Helvering against Stuart, Spiegel Estate against Commissioner who say that ordinarily you will accept the opinion of a local judge and the local law and judge Van Oosterhout has shown by who is who practiced law, was in the Iowa bar for 30 years and sat for 11 years on the district bench in Iowa, which is our in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.941" offset="6295176">Now the Reynold's case is a case against Northwestern Mutual, where the receipt was conditional upon insurability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.810" offset="6334568">The man passed his medical examination and then died the next day and the company said that he wasn't insurable because the proof of death showed some previous heart trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.877" offset="6394859">Now exactly the same claim was made in that case that is made in this, that when the receipt was given he was granted temporary insurance subject to be discontinued upon the rejection of the application on the ground of his non-insurability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.479" offset="6489318">And the Iowa court held that the insurability of the applicant on the date of the medical examination is by the contract made the test of a company's liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.063" offset="6539577">Now the counsel for the plaintiff in that case says -- said just what he is saying here, that the insurance becoming effective upon the date of the medical examination, now that was date of the medical examination, here it's the date of the application, but there is no difference between those two, it is the prior case, and they are both of course (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.263" offset="6632469">He contended the insurance becoming effective upon the date of the medical examination continues in full force, until the application is rejected by the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.049" offset="6667577">That contention was denied and the Court went on to say that if the insurance did become effective, it became effective at the past date of the medical examination because that's what the receipt said, but that's what they didn't say; that, that was against the public policy of Iowa, and there is not a word (Inaudible) about public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.215" offset="6752214">They said that the contract contemplates that the liability will attach before the issuance of a policy, but they said that as he was not insurable on the date of the medical examination, although he had passed it, the company was not liable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1723.820" offset="6998601">Now this Reynold's case is the law of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.778" offset="7018454">Counsel takes two extraordinary positions here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.208" offset="7028172">He says that Court of Appeals was wrong because it didn't follow the Iowa Law, under the Erie case and then he says that the Erie case will throw that up now and make a uniform federal rule of that would be applied to all of these cases and not follow the law of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.096" offset="7119705">This is obviously since Erie Railway, a decision to be governed by the law of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.849" offset="7142797">The law of Iowa was laid down by the Reynold's case and the Court of Appeals after signing that case wound up with the one paragraph that summed up the whole thing, the insurance was not in effect for reason that the applicant did not and could not meet the insurability conditions set out in the conditional receipt, because of his aviation pursuits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1809.990" offset="7343313">It was left to the jury on question (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.682" offset="7354075">The court, the lower court picked out the receipt the first proviso, which was that he shall be in good health.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.862" offset="7394826">He ignored the second proviso entirely and he instructed a jury, that there was only one question in the case and that was whether the insured, the applicant was in good health on the date of the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.223" offset="7440280">Now there was no illness in the record whatever about this good health, except for the fact that he had passed an examination of a pilot's license about months before and there was nothing in the record to show what the qualifications for that were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.828" offset="7486673">But in view of his view and the view of the view of the Circuit Court tool, it didn't make any particular difference whether he lied about his aviation record or didn't lie or whether he -- the fact was that, that would have been discovered by the -- as you can see, that would have been discovered by the investigation and whether or not he told the truth or didn't tell the truth was really immaterial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1892.164" offset="7672038">Was there enough there, to make an issue of fact for a jury and on that question and so that the Court of Appeals ought to have sent the case back for a retrial before a jury of that issue, rather than to have simply held the plaintiff was entitled to recover?</text>

            <text syncTime="1922.622" offset="7793873">I mean if we grant that, it didn't make a difference whether the applicant told the truth or didn't tell the truth or that doesn't make any difference where the applicant wrote the -- signed the application after the answer was there or before it was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.839" offset="7854686">Now the only evidence to this, the only evidence on the book was the direct testimony of the agent and the testimony of a woman clerk who was there, and said that she didn't hear him ask Hinkle, any aviation questions, but she was busy about her own work, and did not pay any particular attention to the conversation, until she heard the agent call on the telephone to make the appointment with the doctor.</text>

            <text syncTime="2442.959" offset="9875205">But there were 300 questions raised in the motion for directed verdict and under our rule in Iowa if a motion for directed verdict is based on with say foreground and the District Court chooses to pick out one of them and say I will sustain it on number one, and I'll overrule two, three and four then I come to an Appellate Court even though the Appellate Court may not agree with him on number one, if either two, three or four were good, the motion is upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.170" offset="10028074">Now we raised the additional points which the court specifically did not pass on.</text>

            <text syncTime="2496.002" offset="10087424">But the application was never completed by a medical examination and there was -- never came to the Home Office of the company and therefore under the general contract law, the meeting reminds that there never was a complete identification upon which the (Inaudible) could meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.382" offset="10152939">We said that this question of immediate coverage was explained by the testimony but if it was thought to vary the terms in the receipt we put it that the agent had no authority to bind the company to a contract of insurance because of limitations of his authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.600" offset="10221798">And the Circuit of Appeals referred to that as a serious of question of law which we will not consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.678" offset="10242069">And fourth we refer to an Iowa statute which says that no contract of insurance shall be issued in Iowa in excess of $10,000 without a medical examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.611" offset="10289821">And we say that the applicant was bound to know that and without a medical examination this company couldn't meet a contract of insurance and the Court of Appeals again said that that was a serious question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.828" offset="10338722">Now then as to the two cases in the Gaunt case and the Liberty and National case against Jones in Tennessee, the Liberty National case receipt, instead of saying insurance applied for said in the receipt itself it two places, and this is underlying the opinion by the Court of Appeals, the insurance granted here under making the receipt itself a contract of insurance, the insurance granted here under, and the court held that that was a binding receipt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.697" offset="10470170">The -- Judge Hand in the Gaunt case held under the law of the Connecticut where he could not find any law but on the general law that he felt the contract was ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.213" offset="10508204">No plea of that ambiguity was made in this case, and the court held that we think the Iowa court would not find the contract ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.919" offset="10555016">But there are, we submit the case, that the (Inaudible) case which my opponent referred to, the Fire Insurance case, the powers of fire insurance agents and life insurance agents are entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.672" offset="10618023">You ensure your house against fire, you want to (Inaudible) so your house doesn't burn down at night, that night and general agents and agents of insurance of fire and causality companies are authorized to bind their companies by -- I will, I think Your Honors will find that the -- we'll know that a life insurance company does not consider its underwriters, as its agents as underwriters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.451" offset="10733171">Its applications have to be approved, and its Home Office after being gone over by it's underwriting department, and I think Your Honors will fail to find a case, my research and research of my opponent has to failed to find it where they said that a man was insured one of these conditional receipts, when the conditions had not been complied with and the insured was not insurable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.856" offset="10822823">In both the Gaunt case and the Liberty National case, the Court found that each one of those men was insured, and to link with the Liberty National case they pointed out in that case that they had refused a liability under similar contract which came up from Michigan because they were bound by the law of Michigan, but they found no law in Tennessee and they held that, that contract which was a much broader contract than this, did create a binding contract of insurance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2729.932" offset="11023130">I know he knows the Iowa law, because here it is, (Inaudible) now he turned around got his (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.316" offset="11048626">He says here we believe the Iowa court would not find the conditional receipt before us ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.022" offset="11071509">Well if it wasn't ambiguous how could they introduce this evidence here to bury the terms of this immediate coverage?</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.157" offset="11100035">If immediate coverage doesn't means immediate coverage then you can't introduce the evidence, so they wanted to prove it was ambiguous, now he is wrong about that, it is ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.272" offset="11132426">They are the ones who claimed (Inaudible) and that their evidence wasn't admissible to bury the terms because it wasn't ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.042" offset="11163564">Now in the printed brief they claim now that this case isn't like Judge Hand's (Inaudible) one in the Sixth Circuit because those were ambiguous and this wasn't and I've got -- sure to explain that if the (Inaudible) see it, because it is clearly fallacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.688" offset="11218108">Anyhow he said that I believe the Iowa court would construe this contract as providing insurance from the date of this receipt subject to the condition that if the insurer rejects the application in good faith for valid reasons and upon the ground that the applicant is not insurable, the amount (Inaudible) applied for, and the premium is returned, no liability would exist if that occurs before notice of rejection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.493" offset="11317373">Now that is what the Reynolds case says, then he goes ahead and he say that they did reject it and that's the thing I complain about, in the two Iowa cases one says if they are assigned a different reason before they -- even if they had rejected it, they signed some other reason for refusal to pay before they rejected it, then under what we call in Iowa the mending this whole (Inaudible) doctrine they can't mend the whole and go and reject it afterwards and the evidence in their own pleading, they plead that they notified the attorneys for this woman that the reason they wouldn't pay is because he never had physical examination and under the Iowa doctrine amending this whole, they are limited to that defense and that's the reason I think the trial judge instructed that if he didn't have a physical examination he would have passed it if he is in good health.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.494" offset="11521337">Therefore if he is in good health, it's immaterial whether they had a physical examination or not and that's what the American Law Institute says about excusing conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.372" offset="11556864">That if the condition would have occurred, if it had gone ahead and do it, the fact that he was prevented from doing it by death or they prevented it from doing it but putting it off to Monday, and if he was in good health, then he didn't need a physical examination, and that's the Iowa law, and I cite the case in there on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.323" offset="11616632">Now fallacy (Inaudible) is in applying their facts they think or they go ahead and show that they did reject it, but here is where they rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.623" offset="11661876">The case I cite says it has to be rejected by the committee in the office and Mr. Arnold their Vice President testified and here was their theory, we have never accepted this offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.653" offset="11709942">An offer can't be accepted except by our committee that passes on this, and we do not take the doctor's report alone and then to corroborate it he brought in a Mr. Mustard who is the head agent of the detective agency who testified that he had (Inaudible) business and they all just turned it over to detective agency and that no man is insurable until the detective agency gets through with it and then he is still not insurable till they pass on and in this colloquy he complains about with the judge, the judge was trying to help him out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.923" offset="11831045">He was trying to say, at least I understood it, (Inaudible) if you're claiming that a man is not insurable until you have passed on his insurability, then you are just making your contract void because you're contradicting the first term and that's what they did in the Reynolds case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.621" offset="11909831">There was a clause in the Reynolds contract says and provided an insurance policy is issued and delivered to the insured or to his representatives and the Iowa court took that out, they didn't say why, but it's obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.275" offset="11964479">It contradicted the first clause and the Iowa law is that a contract must be interpreted (Inaudible) against the man who drew it, and I have got the answer to this, or give you these cases, because in his brief he says, the Judge Hand's case in the Sixth Circuit says the local law wasn't the same, and I want to show you that the local law in Iowa was exactly what Judge Hand said the law is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.099" offset="12071790">Where one drafts a document, uses ambiguous language or failure to admit to more than one construction, the meaning to be given in which they are under is the way in which they are understood by the other party, and that's Minnesota Linseed Oil Co. against Montague &amp; Smith, 65 Iowa 67, and it isn't in my brief and I believe that somebody write down the citation, 21 Northwestern 141.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.332" offset="12180668">Under the well recognized rule, if a right is to be construed against the author of it, rather than in his favor, now that's just what Judge Hand was saying when he said -- he read the way that other party understands; Central Northern Fire Insurance Company against Omaha Life Company, 194 Iowa 205, 189 Northwest 723.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.914" offset="12299055">The Court should interpret -- here is another one, the Court should interpret a contract in the light of the purpose of the buy and entering into it, and then it goes into pricing, that the interpretation, if they want to put on it, would defeat the purpose of the contract, they shouldn't interpret it, so as to defeat it's purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.470" offset="12373243">Now his whole argument there was the insurability, means the willingness of the insurance company to insure, and that is never determined according to him until the insurance company sort of adopts the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.552" offset="12433533">Now the court here said it rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.334" offset="12444714">That the only time they ever rejected was in the attorney's office when they prepared the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.960" offset="12467179">They did plead in the answer, but they were rejected, but the Iowa is too long, they attorneys after they are sued to do the rejecting, it's the board of directors or the committee that passes it on that has to do it under the Iowa cases, and they never did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.000" offset="12523395">So he has got his facts completely wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.735" offset="12538337">They got their law, and I just quote he is right, but they got the facts wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.996" offset="12567385">Now there is one question they didn't -- they said that it was a serious question, it wasn't answered and that's when Mr. Henry just raised, I want to give you the Iowa case that will answer that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.596" offset="12605733">The Iowa court has never construed this particular statute that he refers to which is in the chapter on the regulation of insurance companies, and it does say the commissioner of insurance should not approve the contract for over $10,000 that doesn't contemplate a physical examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.673" offset="12682115">And then it says that no insurance company shall issue a contract that doesn't contemplate or it doesn't have an examination, but it doesn't say it's void.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.014" offset="12719417">Now that is analogous to the same old thing as to old, than in the days when corporations were prohibited from doing business in Iowa unless without a permit, it's the same thing, they were told not to do it and they went and did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.961" offset="12771244">Then they come in and want to claim the benefit of their own wrong and say we did wrong in issuing this policy, but we want the court to hold this for us, because we are wrong, (Inaudible) on that night here is where I made a mistake, I assumed that this Iowa judge knew that, but apparently he didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.500" offset="12837386">Anyhow the Iowa cases, there are plenty of them, we have a corporation, takes advantage and goes and does something that the statute says it should do, that can't take the benefit of their own wrong, I think that's another estoppel, another case on that in Iowa is Spinney against Miller, 114 Iowa 210 or 86 Northwestern 317, now those aren't very recent cases, but I got them out in a hurry and I think the earlier they are the more (Inaudible) and now I wanted to make one remark about the logic of this thing, in other words the -- I have been arguing here merely on the policy of Iowa, that he said that this man was not insurable for the amount and plan and rates applied for, and I say absolutely if you follow these odd rules here, if you interpret the contract the way the insurance company wants to interpret it, and in their motion for directed verdict, they didn't say he wasn't, they said he isn't according to our underwriting rules and practices, well the contract doesn't say he has to be insurable according to our underwriting rules and practices, then to bury the terms of this contract, they brought on these two witnesses to prove what their underwriting words and practices were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.687" offset="13150124">Now if they have to prove what their practices are, in order to prove that these details didn't happen, well that is certainly a question for the jury, whether that was correct about the underwriting rules and practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.102" offset="13203832">But even with that end, here is the way they interpret it the fact that he wasn't insured when it says satisfactory evidence of insurability, they say that means conclusive proof, now that's their argument, that satisfactory evidence means conclusive proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.973" offset="13275303">Now I don't claim that he could send in conclusive proof, it doesn't say he had to, and they testify also that what they meant by that clause, they meant the medical examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.144" offset="13319920">Now if that medical examination had gone in, and I think this was time of Judge (Inaudible), the medical examination had gone in and he was of good health, the medical examination would have shown it and if the medical examination showed he is in good health then they did have satisfactory evidence with their own doctor saying that he had satisfactory evidence that he was insurable and the testimony is that even with these airplane activities he still was insurable for every amount they had -- well I did use the word eligible but I don't see any difference, he was eligible for insurance for every plan they had and for every amount they had, but they said it will cost him a little more money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.741" offset="13490343">Now they want to define this word rating, and I think judge, the judges wrote in their knowledge, their guess as to what it really means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.425" offset="13537050">I looked at the dictionary and this is what rating says to me, it means a financial standing that an American field agency assigns to a man and then there is other definitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.061" offset="13579577">Now if there are two definitions to a word you can adopt a definition, even one that doesn't exist, assume their definition exists, you can't adopt the definition that's most favorable to an insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.018" offset="13631404">You got to adopt a definition that at least would mean to the average man and if the dictionary gives two definitions certainly a court can't say as a matter of law which definition he likes the best.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.831" offset="13686680">Now they -- here is another thing to show due process of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.267" offset="13700472">I haven't got this means to turn up the history and the pedigrees of the judges, but he tried to talk about in his brief, the (Inaudible) brief, he writes up a glorious statement about judge, one from South (Inaudible) and he says in there, I didn't know it, maybe it's not true but I like to concede that it is that for years he was Commissioner of Insurance in Missouri and therefore he found them all what insurance companies think.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.885" offset="13806947">Now if that's true he should qualify his expert witnesses during the trial, not try to qualify him on a (Inaudible) and if that did what he says he did and used his knowledge as Commissioner of Insurance, Minnesota as to what insurance companies think he should have let me cross examine him because all he is doing is qualifying here as an expert witness and I don't think it's due process of law for an Appellate Court to substitute himself as an expert witness and then after he does his own testifying they are indirectly by putting in this and pass on the truth of his own expert testimony and that's what they did here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3484.293" offset="14040586">I assume that they are going to decide according to the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.164" offset="14052080">I know there maybe some human nature of the Commissioner of Insurance, they are trying to get a case and slanted the way his sympathies are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.615" offset="14093876">I don't know what the sympathies of an insurance commissioner are, in Minnesota I know what they are in Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.292" offset="14116551">I can tell you this (Inaudible) insurance commissioner unless the attorneys for the insurance companies approved them and sought they get a point.</text>
