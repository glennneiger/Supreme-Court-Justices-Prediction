            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 278, Aaron D. Frank, Appellant, versus State of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.280" offset="144488">Mr. Lipsitz you may proceed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="benjamin_lipsitz" startTime="13.442" stopTime="519.003">
            <label>Mr. Benjamin Lipsitz</label>
            <text syncTime="13.442" offset="157132">May it please Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.923" offset="167058">In this appeal from his conviction in the Criminal Court of Baltimore, appellant challenges the validity of one of the health ordinances of the Mayor and City Counsel of Baltimore under the Constitution of the United States on the ground that this ordinance purports to impose upon him a criminal penalty for mere refusal to submit to an invasion of his home by a health officer of that city, acting on a suspicion alone and without any search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.595" offset="297775">The ordinance of course is limited in its operation to the boundaries of the City of Baltimore, but the problem that is here presented is broader in scope and raises the question whether the homes of the people and the privacies of life shall be subject to violation by government employees without warrants throughout the nation wherever men live under comparable health regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.853" offset="402787">The immediate issue is relatively clear cut, the question maybe perhaps best phrased, “can a health officer of the City of Baltimore lawfully enter and search a private dwelling house where the owner or occupant objects?”</text>
            <text syncTime="92.124" offset="471855">Appellant contents that he cannot, that the ordinance under which he purports to act is unconstitutional in that it subjects him to an unreasonable and an unlawful search, a depravation of his liberty and property and a trespass upon his property all in violation both of the Fourth Amendment to the Federal Constitution and of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.896" offset="570911">The ordinance is set out in the record and in appellant's brief, and it reads as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.003" offset="607378">It's at page 56 of the pamphlet, copy of Article 12, which is the health article of Baltimore City Code or at page three of appellant's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.160" offset="648025">Rule 120, whenever the Commissioner of Health shall have cause to suspect that a nuisance exists in any house, cellar or enclosure, he may demand entry therein in the daytime and if the owner or occupier shall refuse or delay to open the same and admit a free examination, he shall forfeit and pay for every such refusal the sum of $20.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.398" offset="764949">Now the case arose in this manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.131" offset="775920">The Mayor and City Counsel of Baltimore, exercising within the limits of that city all the police power of the State of Maryland, made this ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.786" offset="826493">On February 27, 1958, a inspector or a sanitarian gentry, an officer of the Bureau of Road and Control of the Baltimore City Health Department received the complaint of rats in the cellar of a person who lived in 4300 block of Reisterstown Road, Baltimore, Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.260" offset="908413">This is the block in which appellant's house is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.830" offset="922728">Acting on this complaint sanitarian gentry went to appellant's house.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.448" offset="945194">He had with him two student inspectors who were being trained to take places in the multiple dwelling inspection program of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.268" offset="984482">As a prelude to his examination of appellant's property, he knocked on the door, but no one responded.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.072" offset="1011649">So began to make an inspection of the outside and the yard of the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.668" offset="1034010">Now the house which appellant occupies is a detached plain wooden structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.406" offset="1056998">There are pictures of the house in the record opposite pages 29 to 35, there are eight photographs there which were introduced in evidence by the state, they show the house and part of the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.708" offset="1110183">The inspector looked around the yard and he testified in the Criminal Court of Baltimore that he saw undue trash and debris.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.915" offset="1147068">He testified that he saw a pile which he later determined was composed of rodent feces, straw and other items.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.499" offset="1189386">He did not at any time, although he was pressed to do so, identify the feces as rat feces, he insisted that they were rodent feces.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.500" offset="1225331">At this point he apparently felt that he had cause to suspect that there was a nuisance in appellant's house.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.905" offset="1255006">Appellant about this time emerged from the house and spoke with the sanitarian in the yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.277" offset="1284472">He asked the sanitarian what he was doing on the property, and the sanitarian gentry identified himself, showed his badge, explained his suspicions and demanded entry to the cellar of the house to make an inspection for rodents or rats.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.936" offset="1339120">Appellant informed him, according to the sanitarian's testimony, that he would not let him in the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.827" offset="1362631">The language that he used was, according to the sanitarian, you will have to get a search warrant if you want to get in this house.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.527" offset="1393455">This is set out at page 19 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.673" offset="1406098">The sanitarian did not enter the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.797" offset="1418533">On the next day, February 28th he returned to the house with two police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.829" offset="1442670">He stated in his testimony that the purpose of the return visit was, “That he wanted some witnesses,” this is set out at page 21 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.446" offset="1485197">He did not find anyone at home on this occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.449" offset="1497213">He made an outside inspection of the premises again.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.572" offset="1509648">He did not observe the interior of the house on either visit.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.141" offset="1527933">He then betook himself to a magistrate, to Magistrate Neiven, who was one of the police magistrates in Baltimore City and who, it happens, sits in the Housing Court in Baltimore City ordinarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.605" offset="1573804">He went to Magistrate Neiven and he made affidavit that he suspected that there was a nuisance in appellant's house consisting of undue debris, trash, and rat infestation and that appellant had refused to allow him entry to the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.464" offset="1633259">And based on this affidavit a warrant was issued and on March 5, 1958, one year ago exactly today, appellant was arrested while he was seated in his automobile on the street by a police officer and he was taken to the station house.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.153" offset="1703999">Now on the next day March the 6th he came up for trial before the magistrate on the complaint of the sanitarian and he was duly found guilty and fined $20 as the ordinance provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.582" offset="1749661">He took an appeal as is his right under the practice in Baltimore City to the Criminal Court of Baltimore which ordinarily sits as a nisi prius court, but which has special appellate jurisdiction in appeals from police magistrates, and he was granted there a trial de novo as is the practice at Baltimore City.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.736" offset="1826356">The case was heard again, the inspector testified, the police officer testified, the appellant did not testify in either case and the court entered a verdict of guilty and fined the appellant $20 in accordance with the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.034" offset="1879542">Appellant then asked the Court of Appeals of Maryland to hear this case on certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.907" offset="1903052">There is a provision in Maryland law for that sort of procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.887" offset="1914964">It's little used and the Court of Appeals has discretionary jurisdiction to hear a case when they think it's of such general public interest that they should take it up and determine it.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.288" offset="1952475">In this case, they denied certiorari and the appellant filed his appeal to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.178" offset="1980061">None of the courts below entered any opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.998" offset="1991346">However, the Court of Appeals of Maryland, prior to this case, I believe in 1953, had decided a case called Givner against the State, in which among other points the same section was before the Court on the question of its constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.089" offset="2055711">Appellant in all the lower courts made his defense on the constitutional grounds, and in each instance the verdict against him necessarily sustained the validity of the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.103" offset="2103777">Now appellant contends that a health officer of Baltimore City cannot lawfully enter his home without a search warrant when he objects.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.464" offset="2137213">He contends that this ordinance is repugnant to the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.517" offset="2157484">It's repugnant to the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.346" offset="2164799">It's repugnant to the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1633.285" offset="6636544">I think that -- I cover in my brief and I -- the argument as to whether this is a criminal or a non-criminal search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.740" offset="6670294">Now I submit that it's a criminal search and I submit that for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.646" offset="6693909">First of all, if you look at the section that was dealing alone, Section 120, clearly it's a criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.300" offset="6720554">If you refuse to let the inspector in you get hailed into a criminal court and fined $20.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.554" offset="6741556">Now if you look at the general provisions of the Baltimore City Health Code about nuisances, the provisions which require that a health inspector go in, make an examination and if he finds anything wrong send a notice to the occupant who then is given a chance to rectify the condition and a second inspection is made, if the condition isn't rectified he is then hailed into court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.860" offset="6826820">Well part of the evidence that's necessary to establish a prima facie case for the state, if they make the reinspection and drag the defendant into criminal court, is proof of the facts of what was found on the first inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.122" offset="6879901">You have to prove the inspector has to come and testify that he entered and he found certain allegedly defective conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.370" offset="6908844">Otherwise they can't even make a prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.366" offset="6920861">Now to that extent certainly this search is as much a police search, a search connected with a criminal prosecution as any search for a -- by a uniform policemen for evidence of murder or rape or anything else, and is it anymore important Your Honors to enforce the health laws than it is to enforce the criminal laws?</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.258" offset="7012394">An officer who was patently after evidence of a crime in the recognized sense of one of the felonies or common law crimes or misdemeanors, would not be heard or come before any court and say I have the right for my suspicion to come into this house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.439" offset="7081148">And the fact that his mission is for a purpose which is somewhat perhaps more salutary, certainly is no excuse to try to give him such broad powers in a health situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.287" offset="7124511">I've been taught that cleanliness is next to godliness, but does that make a health inspection holy? Is there anything about a health inspection that should allow the sanitarian to trample on the basic fundamental guarantees that are afforded to us by the Constitution?</text>

            <text syncTime="3039.278" offset="12260498">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.783" offset="12274500">We believe in the light of the Wolf case that the main question in this case is whether the search or not to search, that the intended inspection was unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.571" offset="12321625">Now we will have to of course take into consideration the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution also in discussing what maybe unlawful search and what may not be an unlawful search.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.665" offset="12370004">And as was said in the United States versus Rabinowitz there were and is -- there is again – there is against the unreasonable searches but there is not against reasonable searches.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.572" offset="12421622">In other words reasonable searches can be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.821" offset="12434683">Now, the question of what is a reasonable search cannot be answered in any definite definition because the Constitution has not stated what is an unreasonable search, therefore, each case must be decided on its own facts and circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.531" offset="12505527">Now historically the abuses which gave rise to the Constitutional provisions against unreasonable searches and seizures grew out of searches or evidence to be used in criminal prosecutions and dates way back to these writ of assistance in England and in Maryland we also have a Article 26 which is the similar to the Fourth Amendment which is in the United States Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="3127.734" offset="12614301">76 I think it antedates the Fourth Amendment and it's now Article 26, it was Article 23 at that time I believe Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.551" offset="12649618">Now in the Boyd versus United States this case, this Court -- involving the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution involved certain custom laws and this Court made the observation then that in search for penalties or forfeitures which were incurred by commission of offenses against the law that this was a quasi criminal nature, the forfeitures and penalties, and therefore the Court said we think that they are within the reason of criminal proceedings for all the purposes of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.260" offset="12804368">They're throughout.</text>

            <text syncTime="3241.515" offset="13069458">Mr. Justice Burton said, in my opinion the duties which the inspector was seeking to perform under the authority of the district were of such a reasonable, general routine, accepted and important character in the protection of the public health and safety that they were being before and lawfully without a search warrant and as this required by the Fourth Amendment to protect the right of the people to be secure in their person, house, papers and effects, and I also would like to point out that the minority opinion in the Court of Appeals written by judge Holsoff also found that it was not unconstitutional and his reason was that the requirements for a search warrant apply only in criminal cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="6028.696" offset="24218206">We have had it, as indicated here in Baltimore since 1879 a few refusals by owners or occupants of property of admission in order to do the salutary thing of determining whether or not any conditions need to be corrected from a health standpoint or from a fire or safety standpoint.</text>

            <text syncTime="6620.139" offset="26583960">The health code which is part of the record indicates in Section 112 thereof that if he is satisfied that a condition constitutes an actual menace to health he shall proceed forthwith to cause the same to be abated.</text>
            <text syncTime="6635.688" offset="26646131">In a subsequent Section 114, he is given power if a householder refuses to correct an objectionable condition to do it himself, with his own agents and people and to charge the householder for the work.</text>

            <text syncTime="6655.655" offset="26725961">He can condemn the house in effect and say nobody lives here until the conditions are corrected.</text>

            <text syncTime="6777.176" offset="27212048">The householder's only recourse under this whole code is to stand on its ground and say I won't let you in and I will take my chances on your $20 fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="6785.228" offset="27244335">Now this $20 fine can be quite a coercive weapon because they don't have to wait for the next day.</text>
