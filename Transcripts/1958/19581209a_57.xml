            <label>Mr. Claude L. Dawson</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.169" offset="148041">In the brief filed by the respondents in this Court referred to the petitioner Howard as a Rear Admiral at the time of the release of the libelous memorandum in question, he was then a Captain in the -- employed in the Boston Naval Shipyard.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.520" offset="265488">Now, the respond -- respondent Lyons, the time that this memorandum was issued, was the National Commander of the Federal Employees Veterans Association which has posts in various government agencies from coast to coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.780" offset="362454">The other respondent, Mr. McAteer, was the Commander of the local post of the -- in the Boston Naval Shipyard.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.384" offset="412923">There have been considerable activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.291" offset="424521">The Federal Employees Veterans Association is composed of members all of whom have been -- have honorable discharges in the United States Army, Navy or the Marine Corps or the Air Force.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.737" offset="498291">No one else is eligible for membership in this organization and the -- there's no question about their loyalty to the Government of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.180" offset="552103">As a matter of fact, that is one of their cardinal principles that they have a 100% loyalty to the -- to the Government of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.032" offset="591496">Now, at that time that this memorandum was issued by the Petitioner Howard cancelling the recognition that have been given to the Federal Employees Veterans Association to represent members in various grievous matters -- grievance matters in the Boston Naval Shipyard.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.970" offset="703300">No notice was ever given to their respondents or to any members of the Federal Employees Veterans Association that he was passing upon a question of whether they were eligible to represent the members in the Boston Naval Shipyard.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.272" offset="776443">No order to show cause why they should -- the recognition should be canceled, was ever served upon the respondents or any of the officials of the FEVA prior to the issuance of the memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.497" offset="841331">Now, it seems that in this case the Government has taken a position that in issuing the memorandum in question, that the petitioner Howard was absolutely immune from -- in other words, he was absolutely privileged in issuing a memorandum in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.431" offset="957106">Now, in that respect, there is cited in our brief a number of cases in where this -- this Court and the other courts have extended the rule of absolute privilege in the matter of adjudicating anything that fell within the duties of a public official.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.975" offset="1067238">But the rule is -- is very limited, and it has generally been applied by this Court and to -- and by other courts where the party issuing the libelous memorandum or the libelous statement was either charged with matters of policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.773" offset="1186461">Now, the petitioner Howard was not in anyway charged with matters of policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.234" offset="1216345">Policy of the Navy Department is made and directed by the Secretary of the Navy.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.701" offset="1250200">He was simply the ranking officer in charged out of the Boston Naval Shipyard at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.776" offset="1286457">Now, his contention is, is entitled to complete immunity in libeling the respondents in this action.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul A. Sweeney</label>
            <text syncTime="1741.762" offset="7070386">May I please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.395" offset="7080939">In a few minutes that I have remaining, I would like to clarify what we believe is the position that we take in the case, at least the position of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.459" offset="7129213">May I state at the outset that this is a little unusual in the normal government case where we represent the United States or an official in this official capacity where there's an attempt to bring an action against the -- or to compel its action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.488" offset="7193370">In this case, Admiral Howard, should the decision go against him, will be held personally liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.171" offset="7220015">Now, in that situation much as we might desire a broader decision in this case, we feel it's essential in deference to our client in his personal interest to have this case decided on this narrower ground as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.103" offset="7275813">And that is the reason why I stressed yesterday and wish to re-stress today that we believe, that under the motion for summary judgment here and the affidavits filed in support of it and the finding of the District Court, it is established that the actions of Admiral Howard, in this case, were in the performance of his duties and not in the exercise of a discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.756" offset="7374346">I -- I stressed that yesterday and I'm merely trying to re-emphasize that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.876" offset="7390856">We read that out of the motion, out of Admiral Schnackenberg's definite statement which appears on page 20 that it was a -- there's a -- at 21, I beg your pardon, that it was his duty to furnish copies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.386" offset="7468910">Out of Admiral Howard's affidavit on 22 which he said, “In the course of my official duties,” he furnished this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.868" offset="7502869">Now, I have re-checked and there was no definite regulation if Your Honor please, dealing with matters of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.180" offset="7532126">But again, I would like to stress and touch upon the proposition that not all matters inside the department are governed by specific regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.155" offset="7563995">There are lots of orders and duties that are assigned by either tradition or by word of mouth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.493" offset="7589386">But we have these two uncontradicted affidavits and on the basis of that, the District Court, on page 23, made a finding that the statements were published, and publication of course is what gives rise to an action for defamation in the discharge of his official duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.891" offset="7678934">Now, we believe in those circumstances it was not opened to the Court of Appeals unless accept this finding aside on the ground that it was grossly erroneous and we would challenge that because the uncontradicted evidence discloses as supports this finding of the District Court, that these were actions performed with him in the carrying out of his official duties, that he was required to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.582" offset="7773706">Now, we think in the circumstances of this case that is the disposition which this Court should make on the fact that there's a narrow case whether there was -- they're on the part of the respondents in not filing counter affidavits and not raising an appeal, the question that the finding of the District Court was incorrect and should be set aside, those are not in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.418" offset="7861060">And that there is a simple finding of the District Court on reverse that the acts performed during the course of his duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.938" offset="7895124">Now, turning to the second point of this case, and that also was --</text>
