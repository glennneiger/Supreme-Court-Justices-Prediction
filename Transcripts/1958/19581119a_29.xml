            <label>Mr. Frederick Bernays Wiener</label>
            <text syncTime="20.885" offset="186911">If the Court please, the issue in this case is whether expenditures made by taxpayers to save an existing business from destruction ceased to be deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses because incurred in an effort to convey arguments to the taxpayers' fellow citizens to persuade them to vote against an initiative measure which would've destroyed their business.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.621" offset="313866">The facts are very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.020" offset="323480">Petitioners husband and wife on a partnership interest in the firm of beer wholesalers in the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.190" offset="360155">In 1948, there was submitted to the voters of that State under the initiative provisions of its Constitution, an initiative measure which proposed to close all retail beer outlets and to place all retail sales of beer in state hands just as hard liquor had been under state control since repealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.091" offset="479692">Now, this measure closing all retail stores permitting retail sales of beer only by the State would've reduced the number of retail establishments in the State to one, to wit, the State of Washington and would've put all or nearly all of the beer supposed sellers out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.227" offset="568299">So in order to defend themselves against this imminently threatened destruction of their livelihood, petitioners' expended money together with other similarly situated to persuade their fellow citizens to vote against this initiative.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.207" offset="632247">These arguments were presented in the form of radio broadcasts, newspaper advertising, streetcar cards and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.411" offset="669027">They were successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.639" offset="673938">The initiative was defeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.462" offset="681253">They stayed in business and on their tax return for that year, they took as a deduction as an ordinary and necessary business expense the amount of money attributable to their interest in the partnership that had been expended for these purposes.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frederick Bernays Wiener</label>
            <text syncTime="276.597" offset="1209762">I am not familiar with Judge Boggs' views on the subject of -- even light wines or beer.</text>

            <text syncTime="285.630" offset="1245915">He may have been confused by the fact that there were two different words and he didn't think about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.655" offset="1262007">At any rate, there is no attempt made here by the Government to support the alternative holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.431" offset="1285099">So that we're all here in agreement on the fact that this had a 90% chance of destroying these taxpayers' business and we think that is the most important single fact in the entire case, that what they were fighting would have put them out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.700" offset="1358137">And reflexly, reflexly, the Government agrees with us because in the entire 50 pages of their brief, there is no reference to the business effect of this initiative on petitioner's business.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.412" offset="1421040">Read -- reading the Government's brief, you would suppose that petitioner's were wholesale florists who like to go to the tavern and drink beer with the nature lovers and talk about motion, all the stuff -- a nasty backbreaking stuff you can have in a garden.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.874" offset="1490840">But this had a business effect and that's what the Government doesn't admit.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.569" offset="1509648">Now the leading case, the leading case here on the proposition that it is an ordinary and necessary business expense to expend money to save one's business from destruction is of course Commissioner against Heininger in the 320th United States, and we think that is the leading case and we discussed it at some length.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.889" offset="1594911">And again, the Government reflexly agrees with us because they don't state the Heininger case, they don't discuss it, they cite it twice as a compare and wants us to see also.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.941" offset="1643186">Now, this being a measure that threatened the taxpayer's business which we think as a matter of law involved in expenditures that's ordinary and necessary, what is there to support the result below?</text>
            <text syncTime="403.757" offset="1718418">Well, there's a regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.726" offset="1730226">There is a three-throng regulation and I will take each of the throngs in order.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.378" offset="1752900">First, it says that some spent for lobby may not be deducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.163" offset="1772022">Well, we don't quarrel with that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.451" offset="1785187">Lobbying in the sense of the use of personal influence on and personal solicitation of members of a legislature is so far against public policy that a contract for it is unenforceable and it's been held here over many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.935" offset="1859062">And of course in the Textile Mills case in the 314th United States, that regulation was sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.169" offset="1892080">Now we say, the decision goes on the unenforceability, on the -- the -- of lobbying.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.993" offset="1919352">The fact that lobbying is against public policy on the illegality of the practice because the opinions speaks of insidious influences and legislative halls and that family of contracts to which the law has given those sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.906" offset="1982986">And of course if it's unenforceable, it's illegal and we don't borrow of course with the regulation that says that kind of an expenditure is not ordinary and necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.054" offset="2027604">But, when the regulation goes on to condemn some spent for the promotion or defeat of legislation not involving lobbying, then we have something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.352" offset="2076818">We have a two-fold argument on that branch of the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.053" offset="2091551">We say first, it's invalid and second, that if it's thought to be applied to an initiative provision, it would raise a serious constitutional question.</text>

            <text syncTime="507.000" offset="2131362">And before you -- you proceed farther, may I ask if the regulation implies that it would be illegal for your clients to spend money on this cause or does it just say that the -- the expenditures are not deductible?</text>

            <text syncTime="525.107" offset="2203773">It says the expenditures are not deductible and we say the only way you can properly deny an expenditure which in every other way qualifies within the statute is because of the semblance of the illegality, the Textile Mills lobby, the Tank Truck Rentals penalty, but -- but that to say that simply because the activity concerns legislation, it is not ordinary and necessary we think is arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.136" offset="2327907">It -- it say -- it carves out, attempts to carve out one particular type of expenditure without any reasonable ground for differentiation.</text>

            <text syncTime="596.261" offset="2488404">We make only the -- we make only the point that a -- an expenditure and -- and I will narrow -- narrow my arguments to the sole ground that is necessary here.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.770" offset="2538454">That an expenditure made by a taxpayer to save his business from destruction does not cease which is otherwise deductible under the rule of the Heininger case.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.151" offset="2579937">It doesn't lose its deductibility when he is engaged in a legitimate over an open effort to defeat legislation which would have destroyed that business.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.173" offset="2628106">And the reason is this, we say quite briefly, legislation isn't a dirty word.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.909" offset="2663006">Now contacts for lobbying are unenforceable but if I am retained by a client to appear before Committees and procure the passage of legislations even if I have that contract on a contingent basis, that contract is enforceable, that contract is valid and this Court has upheld those contracts so that there is nothing reprehensible about legislative activity as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.531" offset="2765511">There is no taint and to exclude legitimate legislative activity from the reach of the statute is just as arbitrary as the attempt in being on distrust which was the nonbusiness expense of attempting to preserve property and the Commissioner had said, “Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.205" offset="2828204">You can deduct all the expenses incurred in protecting your property except -- except in expenses incurred in fighting an additional tax assessment which we put upon you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="692.498" offset="2873344">That's wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.344" offset="2876792">Well of course, the Court held that invalid because it was contrary to the statute and we say the same thing is here as long you don't have lobby.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.172" offset="2916080">Now, a fortiori when you get -- and this is the second thought -- second branch of our argument under that clause of the regulation when you get to legislation pending not before a legislature but before the people, then you have something entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.340" offset="2988701">And I recall, to Your Honors' minds the -- the tremendous struggle in the last -- last years -- the last century and then the early years of this century to introduce under the constitutions of so many States' provisions for initiative and referendum.</text>

            <text syncTime="1664.150" offset="6759946">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.016" offset="6775411">This is a federal income tax case arising under the ordinary and necessary business expense provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.767" offset="6818461">It is not a case involving prohibition or direct restriction of any kind upon the use of advertising in political campaigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.728" offset="6858271">And as a income tax case, as what most income tax cases, it comes here with a great long history which I believe has not been fully opened to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.554" offset="6905605">If I may, I would like to summarize at the beginning of my argument the four factors which we believe have to be taken into consideration and which lead inevitably in our view to a conclusion opposed to that advanced by Colonel Reiner -- Wiener.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.898" offset="6966941">The first factor is the statutory term "ordinary and necessary."</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.641" offset="6989928">When this -- when that term first came before this Court, Justice -- or not first -- in the classic case in which it came before the Court, Justice Cardozo said it doesn't impose a rule of law or a verbal formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.918" offset="7039039">He called it a way of life in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.364" offset="7048861">And in the Textile Mills case to which Colonel Wiener referred, the Court ref -- said it's certainly not clear and unambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.326" offset="7076655">The words are general, indefinite, imprecise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.459" offset="7089194">And because they are general, definite -- indefinite and imprecise, they are capable of specific diminution through the course of years by judicial decision, by regulation and that is what has happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.681" offset="7142066">They're not only capable and susceptible of that, that has been the course of history under this regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.200" offset="7164217">If I may use an analogy from the Sherman Act, I don't -- the Sherman Act uses the general expression contract in -- in restraint of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.328" offset="7200684">Now today, we don't look at -- at a particular case before the Court and decide whether fresh de novo, looking at it as a matter of dictionary definition a particular contract or combination isn't restraint of trade -- trade because various per se rules of law had been developed over the years such as a -- a combination to fix prices is a perceived violation of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.447" offset="7301204">Well similarly in -- in this field, the ordinary and necessary business expenses, certain rules of law have been developed over the years and one rule of law that has been developed both by regulation and by judicial decision is that you cannot deduct as a business expense these expenditures for advertising and publicity campaigns for the promotion or defeat of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.734" offset="7398275">Now, about the statutory terms, more than unnecessary, I'd like to say just two other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.779" offset="7422516">One is that they do not cover capital expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.275" offset="7436518">Justice Cardozo also said that there are many necessary payments which are capital charges and therefore not deductible under this phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.278" offset="7468492">And the last thing I'd like to say about the statute is that it's recently as the Sullivan case at -- handed down by this Court last term, the Court said that deductions are a matter of grace and you have to fall within the statutory terms as they have been interpreted over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.079" offset="7539649">Now the important thing in this case is the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.171" offset="7556054">The regulation to which Colonel Wiener has adverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.533" offset="7573504">I will -- I hope to go into that at greater length.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.197" offset="7584162">What I want to say in the beginning is this is not a -- a baby infant regulation untested in the courts which comes here for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.982" offset="7615300">This is a regulation which goes back to the beginning of the Income Tax Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.725" offset="7634317">The first Income Tax Act under the Sixteenth Amendment was passed in 1913.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.379" offset="7652916">In 1915, the Commissioner published a regulation or published a decision in which he said that lobbying expenses and campaign contributions are not deductible as business expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.391" offset="7700982">That was not a regulation, it was a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.606" offset="7709759">But in 1918, still under the original 1913 Act, he published the regulation which is identical with the regulation which is in effect today, or the regulation which was in effect at that time the -- this case -- this case and the succeeding case arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.271" offset="7768482">He added to the phrases lobbying and contribution of campaign expenses, the two phrases "promotion or defeat of legislation" and the "exploitation of propaganda" including advertising other than trade advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.941" offset="7827101">So the regulation comes down to us from 1918 issued successively under the various -- various Income Tax Acts that have been passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.607" offset="7861791">There had been 13 re-issuances of this regulation under each of the Income Tax Act that was -- have been enacted since 1918.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.951" offset="7903169">So, it is a regulation that comes down to us with not only the Commissioner's sanction behind it but with the rule of this Court relating to reenactment and congressional acquiescence in federal income tax regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.031" offset="7971506">Then there are -- the third factor I'd like to mention are the judicial decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.848" offset="7990732">There is the Textile Mills decision of this Court in 1941, almost 17 years ago which we believe is almost wholly, almost but not quite because it didn't deal with an initiative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.938" offset="8039111">But otherwise, we believe it's wholly dispositive of this -- of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.175" offset="8060113">And then that decision from 1941 on has been generally followed in the Tax Court and in the Courts of Appeals so that I think I can fairly say, leaving out for one moment the Luther Ely Smith case to which the Tax Court case to which Colonel Wiener referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.748" offset="8126360">I think that -- with that possible exception which I do not think is an exception but with that -- leaving that aside, there is no dispute or conflict among the Circuits or the Tax Court that this kind of expenditure for publicity cam -- campaign to promote or defeat legislation is not deductible under the regulation on the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.764" offset="8210474">And finally, the fourth factor that I'd like to mention is the congressional policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.281" offset="8236492">I have already referred to the -- the constant reenactment of this -- of the Income Tax Act in the light of this continuing regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.072" offset="8271705">Mr. Justice Whittaker adverted to the specific enactments by Congress with relations to -- with relation to charitable contribution and ex -- exemption of charitable organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.693" offset="8318098">And then there is -- the further fact that I would like to mention preliminary and that is, that this is not a -- what shall I say a capricious or arbitrary determination by Congress and Congress' delegate the Commissioner acting together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.732" offset="8378284">There is a very decided public policy behind -- behind this regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.976" offset="8399287">And that public policy also adverted to I believe in a question by the Chief Justice is the -- is the policy of tax equilibrium that the federal fist for Treasury will stand apart from all -- from attempts to defeat or promote legislation, that either businessmen or non-businessmen who seek to have legislation change will have to bear the entire burden of their own expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.491" offset="8501373">That is the policy which has been properly referred to as the Policy of Tax Equilibrium.</text>

            <text syncTime="2606.509" offset="10529416">The Tax Court itself made that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.030" offset="10543522">I agree with you, the Commissioner now agree with you that that is not much of a distinction but the Tax Court thought it was because it applied it only in the case of a constitutional amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.777" offset="10586467">It continued to apply the regulation in cases relating to initiatives and in cases relating to publicity campaigns relating to acts of State legislatures or -- or of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.469" offset="10637249">So the Tax Court thought that was the distinction, a -- a self-operating provision of this -- of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.740" offset="10666297">The reason why the Commissioner acquiesced because at that time he thought that was a proper distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.285" offset="10688554">He had seen the light.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.306" offset="10696600">He withdrew his acquiescence because it was thought that it would be embarrassing to us to come up here and have to defend both throngs of the -- of the situation in which it would -- because there was no sound distinction between the two just as you pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.548" offset="10761592">But I do think that this much is true that these petitioners and other similarly situated could not properly rest on the Luther Ely Smith case because they don't have a case involving a constitutional amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2798.501" offset="11297416">Now, let me go at once to the congressional policy which is probably at the heart of -- of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.552" offset="11333569">As it's been pointed out, Congress in 1934 to 1936 adopted two provisions which we believe have a bearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.468" offset="11365230">One is the provision which Mr. -- Mr. Justice Whittaker referred to, forbidding the deduction of contributions to charitable organizations of those charitable organizations engaged in propaganda to promote or defeat legislations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.172" offset="11416012">The second provision was a provision saying that charitable organizations which engaged in that kind of promotion or defeat of legislation would no longer be tax exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.128" offset="11455927">Now, these two legislative provisions I think are clear indication that Congress does not want federal subvention, federal support, federal subsidy for the promotion or defeat of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.547" offset="11517576">And this general policy was foreshadowed in the decision by Justice -- Judge Learned Hand in 1930 in the Slee case, S-L-E-E, that involves the American Birth Control League, involved the contributions of the Birth Control League.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.042" offset="11587584">And the Second Circuit Court consisting of Judge Hand, Judge Mack and Judge Chase refused to allow the charitable deduction even though at that time there was no such statutory provision, just came in to the statute later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.836" offset="11638680">At that time, it was simply a provision for deduction for charitable contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.020" offset="11659473">Judge Hand said as Mr. Wiener has referred to and I -- in alignment to that, I'd like to reach the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.697" offset="11690193">Political agitation as such is outside the statute, that is outside in the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.977" offset="11711300">However innocent the aim though -- though it had nothing to doubt -- to doubt a propaganda which is a polemical word used to describe a publicity of the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.729" offset="11750275">Controversies of that sort much be conducted without public subventions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.581" offset="11769710">The Treasury stands aside from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.404" offset="11780995">That we think is the basis of the -- of the entire policy of this regulation and of the statute which Congress has enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.290" offset="11820492">Let me -- let me point out to the Court if I may how our view which I think I can fairly say is the prevailing view works in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.852" offset="11866781">Petitioners -- Mr. Wiener's client and other similar situated can certainly go out and spend money for a publicity campaign to defeat this initiative in the State of Washington.</text>

            <text syncTime="3485.459" offset="14045184">The Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.787" offset="14050513">I was about to say what Mr. Justice Stewart said namely that Mr. Davis kept as far away from the Heininger case and from the business effect of this initiative on my client's business in his argument as his colleagues did in their brief, and he talked public subvention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.791" offset="14126582">This has nothing to do with public subvention of legislative activity anymore than the decision in the Heininger amounted to public subvention of third rates and fraudulent dentists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.984" offset="14179349">Now about these advertisements in the allegation which is an afterthought that the source wasn't revealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.709" offset="14206203">In the first place, the argument circulated against the initiative that State expends under the Washington statute particularly pointed out at 100 page, 101 of this record that it would put a lot of people out of business including not only the beer capitalists but the poor working men and the laborers who carted the kegs and who brewed the beer and who turned the handles on the -- at the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.569" offset="14321664">Now, so the business interests of these people was clearly expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.852" offset="14354787">Men and women against prohibition, who is to say whether that wasn't an accurate collective description of the people who contributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.660" offset="14393971">The important thing here is that the composition of the group was never mentioned at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.563" offset="14421661">It was never litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.180" offset="14428139">The District Court specifically found that everything that was done was perfectly legitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.953" offset="14451231">And as a matter of fact, these advertisements were not in the printed record in the Ninth Circuit and weren't brought here in any form until after certiorari was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.517" offset="14489475">And of course it isn't surprising that being afterthoughts they -- these arguments have some very obvious defects.</text>

            <text syncTime="3689.917" offset="14863026">There might be a difference there but on the other hand, there might also be this line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.005" offset="14895417">Suppose a concerned puts out a new product, why can't it -- is its deductibility for advertising expenses limited to existing products or can forth -- put out the ad so on trying to sell that to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.069" offset="14963649">Also on the shackles, we -- there is a case that we have cited, a very interesting case in the House of Lords where a -- and in England, they have virtually the same ordinary and necessary deductibility provision that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.712" offset="15026239">The difference is verbal, there is no difference in substance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3751.478" offset="15109308">But the -- the point here is we don't have to delimit at this time the outer reaches of the contention that my clients are making.</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.574" offset="15157687">All we are relying on is the Heininger case, the doctrine of a right of business self-defense to protect an existing business against destruction, and to protect it against destruction by appealing to the people and not appealing to the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.712" offset="15234173">Now, that being so, whether the arguments are lurid as my Brother Davis contends, whether they were "lurid" in response to some rather extreme views put forth in there on the record by the proponents of the -- of the measure, I don't think we have to decide because I take it that's the -- the merit of the argument isn't the deciding factor whether you have the right to make it nor in this case, whether you have the right to deduct the cost.</text>
