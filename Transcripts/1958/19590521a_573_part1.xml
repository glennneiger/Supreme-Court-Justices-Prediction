            <text syncTime="11.918" offset="151071">Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.661" offset="166013">This is a condemnation case here on writ of certiorari to the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.470" offset="201226">Without attempting to state the facts in detail, let me sketch them very briefly in order to provide some background for a statement of the two questions which the case presents.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.614" offset="273847">The land involved some 90 acres located on the outskirts of Chicago, was used as a naval airfield during World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.355" offset="324838">After the wars, the Court knows, much government property was disposed of as surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.907" offset="359006">Certain property, however, was leased rather than sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.152" offset="383979">This was done and done pursuant to statutory authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.148" offset="408012">When it was believed that property not immediately or contemporaneously required for public use should be retained in stand-by status because of the possibility or the likelihood that it might be desirable or necessary to reactivate the facility at a later date.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.969" offset="507277">This was such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.971" offset="519293">And the airfield in question was leased accordingly in 1947 for a five-year term with an option to renew to the respondent here, the Illinois Aircraft Company which proposed to operate a flying school at the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.636" offset="609886">The field under the lease was to be maintained according to certain specifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.553" offset="633605">And the lease was revocable by the Government on conditions to which I shall refer more specifically later on 60-day notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.231" offset="680312">Respondent also could terminate on such notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.326" offset="704658">Some seven years later, in July of 1954, when the lease as then renewed for a second term had about three years to run, the Government delivered a notice of revocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.227" offset="784280">This notice as the note itself recited had been prompted by a military decision that the deal should be used as a NIKE missile base.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.249" offset="852407">Respondent at this point took the position that the notice of revocation was invalid contending that the use planned by the Government was not the kind of use contemplated by the revocation provision in the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.669" offset="930043">In respondent's view, the Government was entitled to revoke only if it decided to restore the field to its former use as a conventional naval airfield.</text>

            <text syncTime="242.146" offset="1071940">The revocation provision which is paragraph 14 of the lease uses simply the word “essential” that the Government may revoke on a determination that it's essential.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer</label>
            <text syncTime="280.608" offset="1225853">Their principle reliance so far as the provisions of the language in the lease is concerned is on the paragraph to which Your Honors just referred which is the next to the last paragraph at record 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.532" offset="1281546">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.851" offset="1286771">And on this basis, respondent refused to turn over the premises.As a result of the insistence by respondent that it had a right to remain, the Government some several months after it sent the notice of revocation to it in October of 1954, instituted a condemnation proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.527" offset="1389484">And it obtained on the same day that it filed its condemnation complaint and order for delivery of possession a few days after construction of the missile base began.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.762" offset="1446431">Now the Government's condemnation complaint stated in paragraph 4, which is at record 10, that the interest in the property to be acquired is all remaining outstanding right to title and interest if any, of the Illinois Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.168" offset="1544025">The answer asserted and I refer now to record 31 and 32, reading from the bottom of 31, “By filing the complaint in condemnation in the instant case, the United States elected to pursue a remedy which is inconsistent with the theory that the defendant has no possessory rights and therefore implicitly recognizes the existence of a leasehold interest and is precluded as a matter of law from asserting that the lease has been terminated.”</text>
            <text syncTime="398.256" offset="1696371">The Government proceeded to challenge this position, this doctrine of estoppel, it could be that.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.570" offset="1733674">Both in a motion to strike and in a motion for summary judgment they were denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.318" offset="1756662">The case went on for trial before the District Court, and the District Court throughout the trial accepted the defendant's theory and ruled throughout the trial over government objection that the Government could make no reference to the matter of cancellation, whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.502" offset="1833357">And the Court consistently, with that view charged the jury that it must create the lease as continuing in effect and valuate for the five remainder rather of the five-year term.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.630" offset="1897932">The Court of Appeals with one judge dissenting, likewise accepted this theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.405" offset="1921024">And it affirm the jury's award though it struck down as unauthorized, an increase in that award which had been made by the trial judge on his own, that point is -- is not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.181" offset="1992077">The Court of Appeals said that the Government had made an election of remedies, that is to say proceeding by way of condemnation rather than by bringing a preliminary suit in ejectment or to try title.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.563" offset="2057592">And that it was thereby estopped from denying that respondent had the property interest which it claimed.</text>

            <text syncTime="535.639" offset="2245883">To the end of the term, yes, indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.479" offset="2257272">And the Court said that this was so whether federal or state law applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.375" offset="2284857">As perhaps, my statement already indicates the first question which we raised and we think the more important question is whether the Government by bringing an action in condemnation, which is of course an in rem proceeding, thereby admits that they are valid outstanding interests as claimed by the private parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.308" offset="2400632">And it is our position in a word that the District Court proceeding in a condemnation case must determine a dispute existing two matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.947" offset="2459146">First, the nature and the scope of the outstanding interests and having established that, their worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.351" offset="2504808">The Court of Appeals' ruling, as we see it, has no support in any decided federal case and it is also a ruling which it seems to us has far-reaching implications.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.684" offset="2562069">In varying many condemnation cases, the Government does not know the identity of all of the interested parties and certainly does not know what the scope of the interest to the various private parties may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.776" offset="2622464">Now, this occurs most often, of course, where there are competing private claims to the same property.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.053" offset="2651617">But it may also occur, as it does here, where the dispute over right or title is between the Government and the private claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.784" offset="2694457">And we simply urge that the Government forfeits no right by undertaking to condemn such interest as may be outstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.197" offset="2744195">Let me state briefly the second question, the question as to which the Court of Appeals perhaps failed to make a full disposition because of its ruling on the first issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.815" offset="2790588">And that is simply whether the Government's revocation here was a valid revocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.138" offset="2815875">We argue that so far as the lease is concerned, it conferred a right to revoke whatever the precise nature of the military need and that it's immaterial whether the lease was revoked in order to operate a navy base or an army base in order to service manned aircraft or unmanned missiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.754" offset="2906363">But more fundamentally, we rely as to this point on the proposition that an act of Congress, the very military leasing statute under which this lease was authorized and executed in terms provided that such leases are to be revocable at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.728" offset="2990268">I shall return later to this revocation point, but I'd like to get on first with the broader issue which involves the nature and the scope of condemnation, the issue whether the Government could assert its right to the property or respondent's lack of right in resistance to respondent's claim for just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.276" offset="3096430">Now, the court below has said that the Government had an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.554" offset="3117537">We say that the -- that the decision below really gives us a Hobson's choice because assuming that the revocation was valid, assuming that, the Government, according to the courts below, had a choice, one, of paying for that which already belonged to the Government, or two, foregoing prompt possession, which here was urgently required.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.728" offset="3238327">Otherwise stated, the Government had to abandon the constitutional power of eminent domain designed to enable the United States to acquire immediately and unreservedly property needed for a public purpose or it had to forgo its claim of pre-existing right to the property and pay the respondent for all the windfall in order to get him out of that.</text>

            <text syncTime="902.987" offset="3715323">Of course, if we prevail in that, there'd be an opportunity to apply 90 days for a writ from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.712" offset="3742177">And I think with any kind of good fortune, a resourceful opposing counsel might have been able to spin out the ejectment proceeding for most or all of the balance of the lease term.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.333" offset="3792750">In the meantime, of course, the United States in lieu of having a -- an operating missile base would have a going lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.421" offset="3837053">I'd also like to stress that the Government's condemnation complaint which tendered the question, what if anything is respondent entitled to by way of just compensation, deprived respondent of no right, whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.878" offset="3898911">Certainly, the Government had the indisputable authority to take this land for a public use regardless of the identity of the persons who held the adverse interests regardless of the distribution of those interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.272" offset="3964426">And the only possible unfairness, it seems to us, flows from respondent's theory, which means if it is accepted that in a case where the Government feels it's urgent to take over the property, it may have to pay what may -- for what may already belong to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.408" offset="4060975">The only opinions which are cited by the court below, which seemed to us to furnish any support at all for the result reached, are Illinois State Court decisions.At record 469, the Court will note several references to state court decisions made by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.731" offset="4154284">Now, it's true that the state courts in Illinois have held that a corporation possessing eminent domain powers under the law of that State, that such corporations have the duty to determine in advance of condemnation the outstanding title that they have the duty to make that determination at their peril and that they cannot try any issues as to title in the condemnation proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.058" offset="4271626">We have no dispute that under Illinois procedures, you apparently cannot try a title or a question of title and a question of valuation in the same case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.155" offset="4320005">And certainly, Illinois may circumscribe the powers of eminent domain exercised by Illinois corporations as it chooses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.141" offset="4355950">Now, our point is simply that Illinois law cannot control the exercise by the United States of its eminent domain power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.916" offset="4399000">If this so-called doctrine of election of remedies, which was applied here, goes to substance as respondent argues at page 8 of its brief, then we think it follows necessarily that federal law controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.445" offset="4469112">As this Court has often stated notably in United States against Miller in 317 U.S., a case incidentally decided when there was still conformity with local procedure, state rules, and I quote from the opinion, “do not and could not effect questions of substantive right grounded upon the federal eminent domain power”.</text>

            <text syncTime="1162.899" offset="4754996">As a matter of fact, the Illinois decisions themselves in holding -- making the holding to which I've just referred, state that in Illinois, condemnation is special and statutory and the Court has statutory jurisdiction, limited jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.830" offset="4826676">Now, if this question of election of remedy so-called is one of procedure, the result, we think, is the same for since 1951, when Rule 71A was promulgated, the federal rules have governed and governed exclusively condemnation by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.675" offset="4910059">Now, Rule 71A does not contemplate, does not require an independent proceeding for purposes of ascertaining or defining the respective interests of those whose property is taken rather it provides that the Government shall proceed in rem and then declares that the Government shall join, as defendants, those persons whose names are then known, “Having or claiming,” this is the exact language of rule, “Having or claiming an interest in the property.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.128" offset="5063868">Then there's further provision of the rule for designating other persons as unknown owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.365" offset="5092812">Respondent makes an argument, which we don't think is substantial, that state rules may be applied notwithstanding the enactment of Rule 71A.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.185" offset="5156133">And this is an argument which takes several steps, and perhaps I'd better go briefly through it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.672" offset="5198033">There is a federal statute, 50 U.S.C. 171 which dates back to 1890, which declares that the Secretary of the Army may cause condemnation proceedings to be instituted in the name of the United States for various designated purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.518" offset="5273475">And that statute, in keeping with the old conformity provisions, declared that such proceedings were to be instituted in accordance with the procedures of the State wherein the proceeding was instituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.154" offset="5328018">Now, Rule 71A, of course, was designed to do away with conformity to state procedures and indeed, the advisory note to the rule cited this 50 U.S.C. 171 as one of the statutes which occasioned the need for the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.674" offset="5398026">But we come now to a minor complication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.162" offset="5415999">In 1956, Congress adopted a recodification of the various previously scattered statutes relating to the armed forces and it put them all in Title 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.385" offset="5480887">50 U.S.C. 171 was incorporated and became 10 U.S.C. 2663.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.908" offset="5515055">When that recodification took place, the old language in 50 U.S.C. 71 relating to conformity with state procedures was not deleted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.743" offset="5574301">So, the provision remained until 1958 when Congress making various directions in the Code made -- enacted a provision retroactively deleting this sentence relating to conformity from 10 U.S.C. 2663.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.529" offset="5661445">And then the relevant reports accompanying that 1958 Act, Congress declared that the earlier failure to delete that particular language at the time the recodification took place had been an oversight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.754" offset="5722363">We failed to see, though the respondent seeks comfort from this history, how it aides respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.582" offset="5749739">In the first place, Rule 71A became effective in 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.528" offset="5777533">This condemnation was brought in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.190" offset="5796133">That was the only time the Government could possibly be charged on any theory with having made an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.029" offset="5827480">The recodification taking place in 1956 but thus have no bearing on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.919" offset="5855065">But more than that, we don't think the recodification in 1956 can have any proper bearing on any case because at the time of the recodification, Congress made clear in the statute which put the recodification into effect that no change in existing law was either made or intended thereby.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.191" offset="5944090">This was purely a formal revision and of course, the earlier 1951 adoption of the federal rule relating condemnation proceedings must govern.</text>

            <text syncTime="1484.527" offset="6041475">And getting back to the mainstream, I have already stated that Rule 71A, as we view it, contemplates the joining of defendants who claim to have an interest in the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.006" offset="6099362">And this, we think, necessarily implies that the condemnation court is to determine both the validity of the claim and the value of any interest which may be established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.260" offset="6156413">And I think it's pertinent to add, though there are certainly no need to labor the point in this Court, that the basic scheme of the federal rules is to provide a single form of action and to avoid unnecessary multiplicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.072" offset="6227675">Considers, if the Court please, the -- the common situation where the Government is condemning land as to which the private parties may have competing claims or overlapping interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.309" offset="6276577">Suppose the Government names, as it -- as it is supposed to do, all persons claiming an interest, names these persons with overlapping claims, would it be contended then that by naming both, we recognize both claims and we're stopped to deny them and we're required to take of the same thing twice over?Well, obviously not, we'd say for it's the burden of the claimant to establish his right to compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.413" offset="6397053">And the first step in his proof, as we see it, is that he has an interest in the property which is to be recompensed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.778" offset="6434461">Another common situation is where the Government contracts to buy land at an agreed price and then condemns that same land in order to remove any possible infirmities in the title, a procedure incidentally which has explicit congressional authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.758" offset="6522441">We refer to the relevant statute at page 29 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.398" offset="6548982">Now, the case we have here is not materially different nor is it a unique case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.251" offset="6584404">There are at least two Courts of Appeals which have dealt expressly with the contention which respondent made to the Seventh Circuit in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.337" offset="6628707">The First and the Fifth Circuits, we refer to those cases at pages 25 to 27 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.596" offset="6669772">In the Fifth Circuit Turner case, the Court will note the Fifth Circuit held that the United States does not waive any right or title that it may have by proceeding in condemnation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.607" offset="6733824">In the First Circuit, San Geronimo case, which is rather closely analogous on its facts to this one, Judge Magruder pointed out that the Government there was asserting a right to use the premises in question under the terms of a lease, and that it sought alternatively, if that position were denied, to condemn an interest in the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.957" offset="6835179">And he said that the pursuit of these alternatives in a single proceeding was characterized by much good sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.527" offset="6877497">We agree, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.753" offset="6890350">We say that claims to property interests and claims of title are regularly adjudicated in federal condemnation cases as they are in many of the States where the condemnation court has general jurisdiction and where it is proceeding under a court with code which provides a single form of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.152" offset="6980002">Respondent is not prejudiced in this case because his claim to compensation may be defeated here by the Government's claim of right, whereas in the more common situation, his claimed compensation might be defeated by a competing claim of right asserted by another private party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.615" offset="7057847">I come then, and I shall attempt to treat it more briefly to the second question, whether the Government's revocation of the lease was valid.</text>

            <text syncTime="1821.484" offset="7389288">Now, in this case, we -- we think the language of the statute is -- is mandatory language and that we find no cause for skepticism because our reading of the reports indicates that Congress meant to do what it was in turn is doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.553" offset="7453550">Now, the military leasing statutes, two of them, one enacted in 1916 and the other in 1947 are set out at pages 2 and 3 of our main brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.035" offset="7515512">Both, whichever one applies, both provide for revocation at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.953" offset="7543202">We think that the 1947 Act is probably the one that controls here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.224" offset="7576221">And I -- I therefore concentrate on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.112" offset="7587819">And I say that we think it controls because, as the Court may recall, the renewal of this lease five years after the original lease was in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.899" offset="7634944">And it seems to us that the renewal must probably be deemed innovation, a new contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.858" offset="7670784">And that would seem to be so because leases in excess of five years were prohibited by the 1916 Act and also because the Secretary, under the lease, had very broad powers to refuse the extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.957" offset="7747166">Turning then to the 1947 Act, that Act, after providing generally for the leasing of military properties not contemporaneously required by the Government, goes on to state in the last two sentences which appear at page 3 of our brief, “Each such lease shall contain a provision permitting the Secretary concerned to revoke the lease at any time, unless the Secretary shall determine that the omission of such provision from the lease will promote the national defense or will be in the public interest,” and then this, “In any event, in any event such lease shall be revocable by the Secretary of the Department concerned during a national emergency declared by the President.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.036" offset="7951548">I don't see how that can be said to the language which requires or permits interpretation, its mandatory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.213" offset="8000240">And of course, there's no question in this case that in 1950, the President had declared a national emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.116" offset="8035871">And thus, in our view, the lease was revocable in 1954, whether or not, whether or not the lease itself provided for revocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.605" offset="8089788">Now, since the Seventh Circuit seemed doubtful that Congress really meant this provision, let me take a moment to read a single sentence from the accompanying House Report and that's House Report 623, which we've cited in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.975" offset="8159274">And that report states, “Regardless of whether the Secretary does insert such a clause in references to a revocation clause, each lease made under this law shall be revocable by the Secretary during a national emergency declared by the President.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2532.834" offset="10234755">The first issue in the case is what did the parties intend by the cancellation clause?</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.387" offset="10260877">Both the trial court and the majority of the Court of Appeals felt that there was no question whatsoever regarding the intention of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.187" offset="10304136">And that was that the lease could be canceled only for Naval Aviation activities which did not include an army NIKE site.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.285" offset="10344469">Now, this is an extremely interesting and fascinating legal interpretation of the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.653" offset="10378010">But it was arrived at through the exercise of elementary rules of construction such as one must not take out of context one sentence or paragraph of a lease even if you must construe the entire lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.714" offset="10438196">Also, this lease was drafted by the Government and therefore, it must construe most strongly against the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.684" offset="10470066">Also, the Government is the lessor and therefore, the lease must be construed most strongly against the lessor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.638" offset="10505906">Also, the factual circumstances surrounding the execution of the lease and the action of the parties during the term of the lease showing their construction and understanding of the term of -- of the meaning of the lease was considered by the Court of Appeals and the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.393" offset="10576959">And the inevitable conclusion was that the parties intended that this lease could be canceled only for Naval Aviation activities and for no other purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.721" offset="10626278">Now, this may be a very novel -- may be a very interesting lease interpretation problem, but it certainly is not a novel legal point or any novel national interest point which, in the opinion of respondent, should be of importance to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.174" offset="10720110">We respectfully submit that there is ample justification for this Court to say that the Court of Appeals' experienced judges below have exhaustedly reviewed this record and found that this lease could be canceled only for the purposes desired by the parties which was the Naval Aviation activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.846" offset="10810807">Now, I am talking strictly to the question of the intention of the parties which is the first question in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.197" offset="10836198">I'm not saying that this Court should not go into the question of a leasing statute and the authority of the parties to enter into this type of lease but to get into the question of what did the parties intend necessarily involves a very laborious test, and I will have to devote considerable part of my argument to explaining the details -- the detail arguments giving rise to this conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.519" offset="10949465">Nevertheless, to give ample justice to both parties in this case, that laborious process must be followed unless this Court takes the position that the Court of Appeals or experienced judges and that this is very close to the type of cases in which this Court does not want to be burdened such as disputed matters of fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="2842.732" offset="11474317">No, Your Honor, because we would still have to convince this Court that the parties were authorized by the Navy leasing statutes to enter into a lease which had this intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.163" offset="11528025">In other words, do it -- does a Navy leasing statutes authorize the Secretary of the Navy to enter into a lease which is limited in cancellation scope to only Naval Aviation activities, which is a second issue in the case, and I would like to talk about that later, Your Honor, unless you desire me to talk about it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.247" offset="11604407">All I am saying is that at this point, the intention of the parties is all that I am talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.193" offset="11628126">What did they intend by the lease?</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.156" offset="11640038">Now, if they intended that the lease should be canceled only for Naval Aviation activities, then it is my burden to establish and the Court of Appeals agreed with it that they have the power under the Navy leasing statutes to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.186" offset="11704090">Now, in the event the Court -- this Court does desire and conclude that it is necessary to construe the terms of this lease and all the circumstances surrounding its execution and the acts of the parties after the lease was executed, if it is necessary to do this, then the respondents suggest the following considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.404" offset="11816939">First, let us examine the background of the parties at the time this lease was executed back in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.802" offset="11854555">The Navy had used this airport which was a small 96-acre piece of land with a hanger on it and one barracks building and the rest was all grass which was used for the landing and take off of aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.681" offset="11914115">The Navy had no congressional appropriations to maintain this field as Navy property, it have the choice between selling it as surplus property or to retain it by keeping title in the United States Government and leasing to a private airport operators such as the respondent who would maintain the property during the term of the lease so that the Navy could have the property back in case of another international emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.956" offset="12043160">Now, it's very important, Your Honor, if the Court please, that the evidence is conclusive on this, there's no dispute between the parties at all on these -- of these -- these facts that I am stating.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.016" offset="12095404">Now, the Navy had only one thing in mind at this time and that was if they have a Navy airport which they might want back in the case of another future national emergency or a war.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.854" offset="12138768">The respondent was a small -- financially small company but it was vastly experienced the aviation and airport operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.744" offset="12174399">And the parties were thinking of only one simple fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.830" offset="12190699">There is an airport with aircraft flying off of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.796" offset="12206582">We have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.519" offset="12209403">The Navy says “We have the airport, we don't need it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.909" offset="12219016">Do you want to undertake the obligation of maintaining it and sharing the buildings,” which incidentally was a very expensive thing, “and giving in fact to us in case we need it again for Naval Aviation activities?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.375" offset="12268857">There could be no doubt from the record that this is what the parties thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.216" offset="12284217">Now, they placed all this thinking in the preamble of the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.973" offset="12303235">And on page 12 of the record, we find that the preamble states, “Whereas, because of a strategic value, it is considered essential that the said airfield and the facilities thereon, comprising the United States Naval Outlying Airfield, be retained in a stand-by status for post-war use in connection with Naval Aviation activities.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.302" offset="12436564">There isn't any doubt in the world that this sentence expresses exactly what the parties wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.835" offset="12462686">In the next paragraph of the preamble states that -- that lessee desires to lease the airfield and the facilities thereon for use as an airport and for such other uses as may be necessary or incidental for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.194" offset="12524126">Now, the third -- on top of page 13, the preamble also states that this leasing -- that this lease is deemed to be in the best interest of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.926" offset="12583058">Now, the important words are the following, appearing at the top of page 13 in the consideration clause, the parties then stated after reciting their intention above, “Now, therefore in consideration of the foregoing,” now, that -- those words in consideration of the foregoing show that the parties had in mind the premise -- the premises or the preamble and intended to bring the preamble into the body of the lease just as much as if it had been set forth in full in the body of the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.052" offset="12727568">And the Supreme Court of Illinois in an identical case, not involving airport property of course, where the words were “Now, therefore in consideration of the premises,” which is even weaker than our case, which says, “Now, therefore, in consideration of the foregoing,” so there can be doubt what foregoing means, held that the preamble must be construed as an operative part of the lease where that those words appear in the consideration clause of the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.228" offset="12868315">Now, relying upon that case, which certainly is consistent with any state or federal law on the construction of contracts is a simple construction problem, so I think that the Illinois Supreme Court decision is certainly a good authority in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.640" offset="12941981">I think the federal courts undoubtedly should reach and will reach that conclusion as the Seventh Circuit did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.454" offset="12969148">Relying upon that case, the Court then also took into consideration the following language of this lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.167" offset="13016064">Paragraph 12 of the lease, on the record page 19, states that the lessee agrees, they will prevent any use of the premises and facilities herein demised to its possession including the construction, erection, alteration or growth of any structure or other object thereon which would be a hazard to the landing, taking off or maneuvering of aircraft at the airfield.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.795" offset="13138526">This is a prohibition against the lessee respondent ever using that property in a way which would interfere with flying operations of aircraft.</text>

            <text syncTime="3359.074" offset="13539662">No, Your Honor, because, as I will later explain, under no conceivable interpretation as it's possible in this case to argue that NIKE is Naval -- is Naval Aviation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.315" offset="13588668">Number one, there is nothing in the record to prove that NIKE is aviation or an aviation activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.407" offset="13620955">On the contrary, the only testimony on that point is in favor of the respondent where, at page 307 of the record, it appears from the testimony that NIKE is not aviation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.837" offset="13682709">Now, if NIKE is aviation, then I think it's up to the burden of this -- of the Government to approve in that fact in the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.512" offset="13717400">We proved it by having the only testimony in the case that it wasn't aviation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.218" offset="13740283">So we certainly did our burden but the Government never proved it and it's a little late for the Government to at this time make these arguments, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.794" offset="13778526">But there is even a more fundamental point on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.543" offset="13793573">And NIKE is a guided missile which is no more different than an army anti-aircraft gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.285" offset="13820531">Now, an anti-aircraft gun is not aviation because the shell flies through the air neither is NIKE aviation because the missile flies through the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.014" offset="13867447">If that is true, an arrow flying through the air would be aviation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.741" offset="13894301">And that is exactly what the Court of Appeals understood and the trial court understood when they held this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.439" offset="13929096">So, the Government, in effect, has not proven that NIKE is aviation or it comes within the definition of Naval Aviation by failing to introduce any evidence whatsoever about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.740" offset="13978311">But even if this Court were to take judicial notice of what NIKE is, they couldn't conceivably hold, we respectfully submit, that this is aviation, not within the meaning of the -- at least not within the meaning of the intention of parties as expressed in this lease because, as I mentioned before, certain paragraphs of this lease expressly prohibit the lessee from using the field in anyway to obstruct flying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.689" offset="14090115">Now, flying means aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.509" offset="14097429">It doesn't need guided missiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.790" offset="14106520">Now, this is very forcefully demonstrated by defendant's Exhibit 2B, appearing at page 433 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.587" offset="14141733">Now, in our opinion, probably the best authority in the world to decide what is meant by Naval Aviation is the Bureau of Aeronautics of the Navy Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.706" offset="14174229">They have cognizance of Naval Aviation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.455" offset="14189171">And at page -- I'm sorry, on page 433 of the record is a letter from the Bureau of Aeronautics to the Chief of the Yards and Docks via the Chief of Naval Operations dated 26th, June 1953, which was one year before our lease was -- which was one year before the Government attempted to revoke our lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.434" offset="14357086">In this letter, the Bureau of Aeronautics states that it knows of no prior immobilization plans which are required the use of this property for aeronautical purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.128" offset="14399927">Consequently, it's recommended that the outlying Arlington Heights be declared as excess to the needs of Naval Aviation and unless needed by some other naval activity disposed of as surplus property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.374" offset="14448828">Now, the crucial part of this letter is the last paragraph, number two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.119" offset="14467845">“In as much as it is indicated that the area surrounding the field as being build up rapidly and hence holds no promise for future Naval Aviation usage, practically the same words of the lease.It is recommended that the field be disposed of without any conditions as to recapture or use.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.205" offset="14548198">Now, the importance of that paragraph is that the Navy recognized that because the field was being crowded by homes at that time, it became dangerous to use the field for Naval Aviation purposes which was applying of aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.687" offset="14610160">Now, if the Navy -- if the Bureau of Aeronautics which has cognizance of what is Naval Aviation thought that guided missiles were part of this Naval Aviation, they would not be worrying about approach areas over homes such as airplanes have to do and airplanes can't fall down which is one of the big problems of the Navy with these airports around the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.075" offset="14707649">In fact, the NIKE site that is there today is surrounded since that time strictly by homes because NIKE does not have to make an approach over the homes in order to be useful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.060" offset="14763656">So, on all points, Your Honor, as we respectively submit that the -- the Government's position is -- is incorrect on the interpretation of the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.338" offset="14804720">In addition, I'd like to mention just one more point because too much time is -- I'm forced to put too much time on this interpretation problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.687" offset="14850069">But the record shows, at 208 of the record, that a year after this lease was executed in 1947, the lessee spent over $60,000 of its money in improving the barracks buildings and changing them into apartments for public housing and in building a trailer park on the premises adjacent to the barracks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.209" offset="14956231">The record also shows that the Navy, not only knew of this project, but approved of it in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.630" offset="14985906">They gave their approval to the lessee doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.024" offset="14999489">Now, it just doesn't stand through reason that any lessee would spend $60,000 not at least the lessee of this character about the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.046" offset="15039509">On the -- it would spend $60,000 of its own money on the assumption that it could be canceled out on 60 days notice for any governmental purpose at all as now contended for by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.885" offset="15094888">It was relying upon the preamble of the lease and the intention of the parties right down the line that it could be canceled only for Naval Aviation activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.651" offset="15133968">This was a calculated risk that the lessee, as an aviation expert, could understand and could take and use his own judgment on as a sensible businessman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.515" offset="15177435">But he could not possibly foresee of how -- what million and one chances the Government might have to revoke this lease for governmental purposes only.</text>
            <text syncTime="3778.690" offset="15218082">It's just as beyond belief to believe that the parties so intended in view of the language and their conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.635" offset="15245876">If the Navy thought that this could be canceled for governmental purposes, it would never, I am sure, have permitted the lessee to go ahead and spend $60,000 on the property on that basis of revocation.</text>

            <text syncTime="4037.529" offset="16253471">So much time has been spent on the interpretation of the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="4040.434" offset="16265070">I would like to discuss the leasing statutes, if I may, at this point, rather hurriedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4050.659" offset="16306030">Pardon me, I've lost the amount of time I have available.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leonard R. Hartenfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="4057.203" offset="16332152">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="4062.251" offset="16352423">Now, the Court of Appeals held that the statutes gave, and regardless of which of the statutes we talked about the 1916 Act or the 1947 Navy leasing statute, they read practically the same that if a national emergency occurs, the Navy has a right to cancel the lease, must retain the right to cancel the lease at anytime, and that is roughly or exactly the language of -- of both Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4094.164" offset="16480005">And the Government and the respondent both concede that it makes no difference under which Act we are discussing this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4104.354" offset="16520756">The Court of Appeals held that the statute gave the Navy -- these both statutes gave the Navy the power to lease on a limited revocability basis, namely, Naval Aviation instead of limiting them for the Navy leases to those which be -- could be canceled for only governmental purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4122.792" offset="16594526">Now, this decision is a tremendous advantage to the Government, to the -- to the Navy, this decision of the Court of Appeals because by construing the statutes the way they did, the -- the Navy is given the power to use either one of these two methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="4143.734" offset="16678327">They can either put into the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="4146.241" offset="16688358">The -- it must be canceled for any reason whatsoever, governmental purposes, or they can do what they do on our lease so that they can cancel for only Naval Aviation purposes or some other specific purpose which is the basic reason for the property being recaptured by the Navy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4163.997" offset="16759411">In other words, if the shipyard, then the revocation clause would be pinpointed to one who may be needed that shipyard again.</text>
            <text syncTime="4172.568" offset="16793684">Now, oddly enough, the Government in this case is challenging the grant to it a broad discretionary power is vested into it under the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals' decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4184.997" offset="16843316">Usually, the Government is always saying, “You're taking away our powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4188.162" offset="16856064">We don't like it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4189.546" offset="16861602">Here, the Government is getting an additional power by the construction of the Acts by the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4196.983" offset="16891277">Now, it's a strange thing that the Government is now asking this Court to deprive the Government of powers granted to it by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4206.563" offset="16929625">In other words, the Government is coming into this Court and saying, “Your Honors, we don't want these broad powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4213.494" offset="16957315">We only want to be able to lease on the basis of a revocation where any governmental purpose is the basis for the revocation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4224.062" offset="16999633">Now, this just doesn't sound like a federal agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="4228.872" offset="17018859">This is a futile and needless request being made by the Government in this case upon this Court because all the Navy has to do in the future in its leases is to put into the recaptured clause or the cancellation clause of its leases whichever provision it want if they want to put in broad powers so that it can be revoked only for governmental purposes, let them put it in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4256.794" offset="17130559">If they want to restrict it to shipyard purposes or any other purpose or in Naval Aviation purposes, let the Navy put it in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4265.130" offset="17163891">Now, this advantage is tremendous because here, we have the Secretary of Navy engaged in one of the largest, most comprehensive leasing programs in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4274.479" offset="17201298">It's got shipyards, it's got airports, it's got practically everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="4278.721" offset="17218226">And the 1947 Act, I believe, if my memory is correct, also includes personal property as well as real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4286.454" offset="17249155">The vastness of this leasing program is tremendous.The statute in its own wording says that he shall have complete discretion as to what he does until we come to the one question that he -- one sentence that it must be cancelable at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4304.117" offset="17319790">Now, that word “at any time,” the Government is now adding the additional words for any governmental purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4312.539" offset="17353540">There's nothing in the statute saying any governmental purpose or isn't one word in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4317.714" offset="17374229">All the statute say is that the lease must be canceled at any time during a national emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="4324.836" offset="17402755">This is exactly what our lease does.</text>
            <text syncTime="4327.328" offset="17412681">Our lease says that it can be canceled for Naval Aviation activities at any time during the national emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="4335.499" offset="17445386">This is the whole purpose of leasing to us in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="4339.280" offset="17460537">The Navy had an airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="4341.300" offset="17468583">The Navy wanted back in case of another war or national emergency and they reserve that right to have it back in case of another national emergency or war.</text>
            <text syncTime="4351.678" offset="17510066">And the Court of Appeals says it is absurd.</text>
            <text syncTime="4354.387" offset="17520933">It's ridiculous to construe a statute any other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4358.221" offset="17536293">And a sensible reasonable businessman doing business with the Government, they have to -- you have to place the Secretary of the Navy in a position where he can negotiate contracts which will benefit the Navy in a sense that they will get solvent and financially responsible people to become lessees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4376.927" offset="17611107">Now, a sensible businessman will simply not expose himself to the hazards of a lease which can be cancelable for any reason whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="4386.437" offset="17649142">And on that point, interestingly enough, the only case that has ever been decided to my knowledge on the very point we're talking about in the 1916 or the 1947 Act, there's a Hingham Management case which is cited by the Government in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4401.949" offset="17711208">Now, interestingly first of all, that case has absolutely nothing to do with this one because the language is explicitly clear that -- that it followed -- that it can be -- release can be canceled at any time by the Secretary of the Navy for any purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4416.267" offset="17768469">There's no question the language is completely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="4418.632" offset="17777873">There is no preamble.</text>
            <text syncTime="4419.612" offset="17781844">There are no circumstances or anything else such as in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4423.733" offset="17798353">But it's an interesting case from this point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="4426.670" offset="17810056">It was a case that involved lessees who turned into crooks and who stole the Navy's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="4433.333" offset="17836701">Now, that is the kind of an operator or a lessee the Navy is going to end up with if this Court is to hold that the leasing statutes must be construed to mean that they can be canceled for any governmental purpose whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="4447.716" offset="17894275">It's just inconceivable as reasonable businessman or anyone to get into a venture like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4454.010" offset="17919457">The only type of person that I can even think of who would get into a lease with the Government which said he could be canceled for any governmental purpose whatsoever is a sheepherder who has got maybe a thousand sheep and he has to run them over some grass that the Navy owns this practically revocable permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4471.910" offset="17991032">They do this all the time in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="4475.133" offset="18003884">But a man who is leasing a shipyard and who has a payroll of thousands of people and who is putting in improvements on the property as we did just cannot take that type of a hazard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4486.563" offset="18049651">So the Court of Appeals says that it's unreasonable and absurd to construe the Navy leasing statutes in the manner which the Government is now contending the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="4501.844" offset="18110777">Now, on page 38 of respondent's brief is an excerpt from the Senate Committee Report and the joint Army and Navy Department Letters to the Speaker of the House which tells the purpose of a 1947 statute and this is exactly the way I have been explaining it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4526.902" offset="18210983">This is what the Congress had in mind when they passed the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="4535.589" offset="18245778">38, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4548.173" offset="18296038">Well, the excerpt brief, while all of these plans and that would refer to airports or anything else, they have to be talking about plans, may not be adaptable to peacetime uses as many as possible will be leased to responsible companies which can operate them without making such changes as to prevent their being rapidly put back into operation in the event of an emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="4571.622" offset="18389870">This is the purpose of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4573.898" offset="18398960">The Navy gave us the lease and they wanted the property back exactly the way they gave it to us in 1947, and we're obligated as lessee to give it back to them exactly as this committee report says so that the Navy could rapidly put the airport back in the operation in the event of an emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="4594.187" offset="18480149">It is conclusive, Your Honor, that Congress never intended the ridiculous construction of these -- of these leasing statutes that the Government is now contending for.</text>
            <text syncTime="4604.924" offset="18523094">It just doesn't make sense and the Court of Appeals said it didn't make sense and the trial court said it didn't make sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4614.647" offset="18561964">On the election around this point, I think -- I -- I say this with all deference to the counsel for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4623.663" offset="18598013">My -- our position, respondent's position on election of remedies was not stated exactly correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4630.067" offset="18623613">Number one, and I think the -- the guts of our argument might be summarized in two statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4637.549" offset="18653602">By trying to contest title in condemnation, the Government wants to have its cake and also to eat it on the grounds of expediency.</text>
            <text syncTime="4646.535" offset="18689546">The doctrine of election of remedies will prevent this unconscionable result.</text>
            <text syncTime="4651.400" offset="18708982">And I would like to later describe how unconscionable it is to let this doctrine of election of remedies not apply to condemnation when it applies to every other field of law.</text>
