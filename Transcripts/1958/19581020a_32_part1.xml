            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 32, the United States of America, appellant, versus A &amp; P Trucking Company and Hopla Trucking Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.132" offset="219930">Mr. Spritzer, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer</label>
            <text syncTime="31.417" offset="229021">Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.546" offset="245530">These two companion cases involve two motor carriers, both doing business as partnerships, both of them sued as partnerships.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.093" offset="303731">Both were charged with misdemeanors in that they had violated certain regulations of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.536" offset="345527">The informations were dismissed in both cases on the same day by the same judge on the ground, and this is a quotation from their respective orders, “On the ground that a partnership as an entity, is not subject to liability under the Section set forth.”</text>
            <text syncTime="85.412" offset="445001">Since that holding of Court involved a determination as to the scope or coverage of the statute this case is hereon direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.409" offset="488991">There is no dispute between the parties, let me say at the outset, that the informations here run only against partnership entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.764" offset="530474">No partners were charged as individuals with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.015" offset="551476">Thus the ultimate question, a question of course on which the Court below ruled against the Government, is whether the partnership's defendant charged as such, could be penalized under the regulatory statutes involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.243" offset="628381">The statutes under which they were charged are two in number.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.893" offset="646980">And the first of these is Section 222 (a) of the Interstate Commerce Act which is set forth at page two of the Government's brief and that as, Your Honors will note, is the comprehensive misdemeanor Section of the motor carrier part of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.263" offset="728377">It provides in substance that any person knowingly violating any provision of that statute or any rule or regulation promulgated under the motor carrier provisions, or any condition of operating authority, is subject to fine as prescribed, the fines under that Section running from one through $500.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.688" offset="826075">222 (a) should be read in conjunction with 203 (a) printed immediately below it in our brief, which is the definition Section appearing of course in the same part of the Interstate Commerce Act and that defines person to mean any individual, firm, co-partnership, corporation, company, association, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.635" offset="937880">The other statute which is involved in these informations is 18 U.S.C. 835 in provision of the Criminal Code, which relates exclusively to the subject of carriage of explosives or other dangerous articles and that is set out at page 4 in the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.197" offset="1024188">It provides, as Your Honors will note, that the commission shall promulgate explosives regulations, which shall be binding upon all common carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.480" offset="1069328">It then provides in the penalty Section that whoever knowingly violates is subject to fine or imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.380" offset="1104854">In a case such as this where no death or bodily injury is involved, the fine maybe as much as a thousand dollars or imprisonment for as long as one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.239" offset="1152293">There is a definition Section to be examined in connection with that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.781" offset="1178520">There is the general definition Section of the United States Code in 1 U.S.C. 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.217" offset="1208195">It says that the word, “whoever” includes corporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, and so forth, unless the context of the particular Act indicates otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.507" offset="1277367">This statute to which I've last referred, 18 U.S.C 835, is the same statute, Your Honors, will recall, which was involved in the case of United States against American Freightways which was here in the 1956 term.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.045" offset="1347584">In that case, a District Court had similarly dismissed an information in that instance laid exclusively under 18 U.S.C. 835 on the ground adopted here by the District Court in New Jersey, that the partnership was not liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.812" offset="1426578">The dismissal in that case was affirmed by this Court by an equally divided Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.373" offset="1452910">So, the issue under 18 U.S.C. 835, as to the amenability of the partnership entity is one as to which this Court has not definitively spoken.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.563" offset="1501602">So far as the other statute which is here today is concerned, 222, that issue has not been before this Court at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.232" offset="1544338">I'd like to attempt to deal with the problem raised by this case, if I may, in three steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.296" offset="1580596">First, as we see it, there is the question which I think need not to detain one long whether Congress has the power, the broad power, to treat a partnership as a distinct entity to personify them for purposes of a particular regulatory statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.254" offset="1668368">The second question, assuming there is that power is whether Congress in enacting the statues here involved, had the requisite purpose and has adequately expressed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.911" offset="1723016">And third, there is the question which is stressed by appellees, whether the fact that the statutes here involved call for proof of knowledge or of willfulness creates an obstacle to the result of the Government is urging, namely, holding the partnership entity perhaps on the basis of the acts of its agents.</text>

            <text syncTime="439.583" offset="1861674">I said, appellees draw comfort in arguing that a partnership is not amenable to this statute from the fact -- to these statutes from the facts that the statute used -- statute used the words, “knowingly” and “willfully”.</text>

            <text syncTime="470.948" offset="1987166">In other words, our theory is, that when we charge a partnership as an entity, then we can make out the offense in the same way that we could when a corporation is charged as to the defendant namely, by proving the knowing, conscious violation of anybody, agent or employee of the company acting in the course of the company's business.</text>

            <text syncTime="521.414" offset="2189040">In other words, we can say the only penalty that is applicable when the business organization as such is the defendant is defined.</text>

            <text syncTime="703.743" offset="2918379">I would – no, certainly no constitutional issue there.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.553" offset="2937605">Our opponent does seem to say that -- suggests that Congress has never gone the -- under the common law theory because we point these numerous regulatory statutes which we didn't (Inaudible) under which quite specifically, Congress has defined persons who embrace various types of business organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.505" offset="3053380">And I -- I won't carry any longer on this point except to say one word about the Adams Express case because that is opposed to the situation we had here.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.956" offset="3115238">It involved regulation of a carrier and that is -- it's a railroad carrier under the Interstate Commerce Act Part I.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.503" offset="3149406">And in that case, Adams made the defense when it was charged with a regulatory violation that it couldn't be fined because it was not a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.542" offset="3189530">It was an unincorporated association and Justice Holmes speaking for the Court said in that case that there could be no question of Congress' power, these are his words, “To charge the partnership assets with the liability, and to personify the company so far as to collect a fine by proceeding against it by the company name.“</text>
            <text syncTime="797.307" offset="3292557">Well, going on then to the question of Congress of the purpose in these acts, I've already referred to the passing with me referring to the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.267" offset="3344488">Section 222, of course, covers the whole gamut of regulatory offenses in Part II of the Interstate Commerce Act and where one to go through the various Sections which imposed the multiple requirements to which motor carriers are subject, one would find that invariably, these Sections impose the obligation upon carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.994" offset="3447306">That is true similarly of the implementing regulations promulgated by the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.566" offset="3473638">The whole function of this statutory scheme is to require all carriers to live up to the prescribed and acceptable standards of performance and we think it would be anomalous if the statutes were interpreted, particularly in the case like this where there is a fine for a business offense, we think it would be anomalous if one could proceed against the corporate defendants, but not against the carriers as such doing business in other forms.</text>

            <text syncTime="910.995" offset="3747401">These are all unrecorded cases in which there were successful prosecutions of motor carrier partnerships.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.534" offset="3777494">There are very few reported cases which raised this issue because nobody raised it until after the information was dismissed in the American Freightways case.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.161" offset="3816051">Up until that time, there has been countless prosecutions in the District Court in which it had been either assumed or has been overlooked the point.</text>
