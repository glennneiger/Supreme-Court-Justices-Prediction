            <text syncTime="13.003" offset="51931">Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.961" offset="67814">In this case, an Italian ship owner issued 27 bills of lading at United States ports of loading Houston, Texas and New Orleans, Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.114" offset="120372">These bills of lading were issued with the purpose of covering a shipment of some 30,000 bags of carbon black from those ports to various ports in Italy.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.404" offset="173558">Prior to the execution and the issuance of those bills of lading, the Italian ship owner inserted a clause in that bill of lading which is substance provided that in the event that any dispute arose under the bill of lading that that dispute must be litigated in the courts of Genoa -- Genoa, Italy exclusively.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.765" offset="271047">The assertion of that bill of lading or that clause in the bill of lading gives rise to the two questions now before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.384" offset="301453">The first question is, is that clause valid and enforceable against an American citizen?</text>
            <text syncTime="83.409" offset="333636">And the second is whether the prohibition of a legal action against the captain or ship owner or their agents includes an action in rem or an action against the carrying vessel itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.714" offset="394762">Sense the issuance of the bill of lading and that document is a very important feature in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.581" offset="422243">I think perhaps we take -- we should take a minute or two to discuss briefly the background of a shipment going from the United States to foreign port.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.015" offset="471980">Usually there are three parties involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.949" offset="483788">You have the American producer, the manufacturer of the goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.874" offset="499461">You have the far consumer and you have the intermediary ocean carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.544" offset="522136">Usually the procedure and the consumer get together and arrange for the delivery of certain specified amount of cargo to be delivered at a certain specified date in a foreign port.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.520" offset="574067">Thereupon the American producer, even through its own traffic department or through its agents, usually a freight forwarder contacts various steamship companies who have or which have vessels going to the port of destination.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.979" offset="639896">These steamship companies are not very hard to contact because they have their own solicitors, their own salesman who are constantly contacting shippers of cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.989" offset="687856">The ship owner who has a ship available, who will meet the date agreed upon by the producer and the consumer is chosen.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.977" offset="723905">And arrangements are made for the shipment of the cargo to arrive at the port of loading in time to meet the vessel so that the vessel concerned can arrive in time at the foreign port.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.312" offset="781166">When the cargo arrives at the ports of loading in the United States, they are received for by the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.509" offset="813976">And when they are loaded on board the carrier's vessel, thereupon a bill of lading has issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.615" offset="842397">Now what is a bill of lading?</text>
            <text syncTime="213.236" offset="852846">A bill of lading is loosely called a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.722" offset="866847">But is it -- it is an important commercial document because it is an acknowledgement by the ocean carrier that it has received the certain amount of cargo and of course it enables the consumer to obtain delivery of that cargo when the cargo arrives at following port.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.388" offset="941453">Now oftentimes a shipment never sees a bill of lading until it is signed by the carrier or its agents at the port of loading.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.807" offset="983144">It is not a contract in the usual sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.911" offset="995579">That is, two people do not sit down over a table and discuss the terms of carriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.501" offset="1017940">This bill of lading has been printed and used by the carrier for a number of years in its business, and everytime there is a favorable decision for the carrier issued by the court, you can be sure that that clause or it's concern which is going to give the carrier that benefit, is inserted in this bill of lading.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.029" offset="1096098">Now this bill of lading is about legal size cap and I can demonstrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.595" offset="1118354">And this one, one of these bills of lading which issued in this case contains besides the usual acknowledgement of receipt of a cargo, 39 printed clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.262" offset="1169032">You cannot read these clauses unless you want to strain your eyes without a magnifying glass.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.489" offset="1197871">Now the courts of our country have called a bill of lading a contract of adhesion.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.020" offset="1223993">That is, a shipper of the cargo has no alternative but to accept the bill of lading and to adhere to its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.664" offset="1258580">It is not a contract issued at the negotiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.390" offset="1285538">Now applying to those facts to this case --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="325.344" stopTime="331.211">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="325.344" offset="1301316">Was all bills of lading regulated by any kind of governmental oversight?</text>

            <text syncTime="331.211" offset="1324826">No sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.763" offset="1327020">The only thing that I would say is the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act provides that when you have a bill of lading issued in this country, covering cargo being shipped out that the terms and conditions of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act must be inserted in that clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.483" offset="1397864">Now of course there are some others like the Pomerene Act also that covers the issuance of the bill of lading.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="355.412" stopTime="366.546">
            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="355.412" offset="1421584">Well those carry the goods -- carry the goods by sea allow the carrier to put anything he pleases into a bill of lading?</text>
            <text syncTime="363.127" offset="1452408">You said the restrictions in Carriage of Goods Act itself aren't they?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Joseph T. McGowan</label>
            <text syncTime="366.546" offset="1466096">Well let me put it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.092" offset="1472366">They have this in the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act clause Section 3 subdivision 8 which provides that if a carrier attempts to insert any bill of lading, any clause which number one, relieves enough liability or attempts to lessen its liability, then that clause is null and void.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.022" offset="1548016">And that's also becomes important in this case sir.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="389.807" stopTime="404.926">
            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="389.807" offset="1559197">So presumably if anything else put in the bill of lading not in conflict with the Carriage of Goods Act is deemed to be a voluntary act of the contractor or the party unless a matter of public policy if the court tracks it down as against public policy, is that right?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Joseph T. McGowan</label>
            <text syncTime="404.926" offset="1619696">Well no sir, because I don't think that it's a voluntary act to the party because I don't think a bill of lading can be termed in the same classification as the ordinary contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="1334.999" offset="5339951">One of the arguments advanced by the petitioners which says that the -- this clause 27 is valid, is that Congress and the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act did not state any particular form of forms in which an agreed cargo owner could insert -- could litigate its claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.454" offset="5441724">Now the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act contains a clause, Section 3 subdivision 8, which reads, “Any clause covenant or agreement in a contract of carriage where leaving the carrier or the ship from liability or loss or damage to or in connection with the goods arising from the negligence fault or failing of duties and obligations provided in this section or lessening such liability otherwise then is provided in this act shall be null and void and of no effect.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.347" offset="5569306">Now I say that that clause states in substance that the carrier has only those benefits which are provided for in the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.189" offset="5620715">That holding was set forth in the United States against (Inaudible) Sugar Company which is affirmed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.216" offset="5648823">But I am referring to the opinion in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.453" offset="5669721">I say this clause, clause 27 which gives a carrier an additional benefit not provided for in the Carriage Goods by Sea Act is null and void and of no effect as so provided by Section 3, subdivision 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.925" offset="5739624">Now while I am on a point, I would like to go -- I like to tell the court this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.319" offset="5761254">I don't think that Congress could really set forth a sufficient number of forms in the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act to provide for all possible litigation under this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.023" offset="5812036">Now there are a number of what we call one-ship operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.582" offset="5826247">That is a ship owner which is incorporated to operate one ship only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.102" offset="5856340">Now they are both United States and they are foreign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.511" offset="5870028">So if you have this one ship, call it the Port of Houston as to this case and pick up the cargo and carry it to Genoa 50 and a cargo was discharged in a damaged condition because of the negligence of the carrier, and if there would -- should be certain provisions in the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act which would say that litigation could only be brought in a form or a jurisdiction where the ship or the consignee has it's place of business or the ship owner has its place of business, or the place in which the cargo was shipped or delivered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.293" offset="5997087">And the ship returns to the United States and is calling up one port only and that should be the Port of San Francisco, then we would be prohibited by the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act starting an action in San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.183" offset="6056647">That is a universal rule of -- in Admiralty Law that a lifebelt who has a maritime lead against the vessel has the right to sue the vessel in a jurisdiction where the vessel can be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.710" offset="6118818">I quote -- I stole that language from the case in the Fifth Circuit, it's called -- it's the (Inaudible) case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.398" offset="6149538">So I say that the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, not having provided for any special form or not having given any particular court jurisdiction over any particular claim does not disturb that universal rule in admiralty law and gives us the right to start and -- and act in any jurisdiction where the vessel can be found and then we get back to Section 3, subdivision 8 and I say that the clause herein is limiting our forms especially as far as in rem causes of action is concerned and is invalid.</text>

            <text syncTime="2580.848" offset="10323383">It's found on page 21 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.976" offset="10367896">The railroad employee sues, and instead of suing in the two places specified in the agreement, he sued in that very jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.001" offset="10403944">The railroad company thereupon moved to dismiss the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.937" offset="10435709">And this court, the case found its way up to this court and this court says that the agreement to the railroad company and the employee violated Section 5 of the Federal Employers' Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.403" offset="10497567">In that, by the agreement the railroad companies sought to exempt themselves from liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.054" offset="10524212">I say in this case, clause 27 should be raised with Section 1303 (a) or Section 3 subdivision (a) of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act and we must come to the same inevitable conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.187" offset="10592653">Now the ruling in the Floyd case, I say was enlarged by the ruling in Wilko against Swan which involved an interpretation of the Securities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.260" offset="10641032">In that case, a broker and a customer was doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.044" offset="10656078">The cause of false representation by the broker, the customer ports certain stocks which instead of going up, went down and he sued the broker to recover for his loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.686" offset="10706651">There was an agreement between the broker and -- and the -- and the customer which provided that there was any disputes between the two, the agreements would be arbitrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.933" offset="10759732">Now in the course of its discussion, this Court said that citizens have a substantial right in which to select the form in which they are to litigate these claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.045" offset="10824098">It also said that any agreement made in the advance of controversy, which is the agreement here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.366" offset="10853460">Is good or a different footing from those made in agreements made after the controversy has arisen and it infer and I think it really helped that agreements made in the advance of controversy which seek to oust the courts of jurisdiction are invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.461" offset="10949799">The petitioners in trying to enforce this clause as being reasonable rely on three cases, commonly referred to as the Muller case, the Kearsarge case and a (Inaudible) case, all of which were decided in the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.300" offset="11033182">I call the court's attentions to this fact, that in those three cases, it is recognized that the courts, by contract cannot oust that the parties, I'm sorry, by contract cannot oust the courts of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.462" offset="11097757">What those cases -- or the courts did on those cases was to consider the facts and each one of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.524" offset="11130044">And then find out whether or not the form selected by the libeler was convenient for the file of issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.051" offset="11164108">Now in the Oklahoma or the Muller case, the cargo was loaded on board the Oklahoma at Dockenberg (Inaudible) suite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.230" offset="11196918">During the voyage from the United States -- from Sweden to the United States, the Oklahoma sunk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.669" offset="11222622">It never reached the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.681" offset="11230668">One crew members was saved or returned to Sweden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.114" offset="11248431">In the Kearsarge case, the cargo was loaded on board the vessel in Peru and the cargo was discharged at European courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.938" offset="11283749">That vessel on that voyage never called at any port in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.580" offset="11306318">No part of the contract of carriage was performed in the United States, so too in the (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.017" offset="11335993">The cargo in that case was loaded on board the vessel and headed for Belgium and discharged at the (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.298" offset="11365146">No part of the contract of carriage was performed in the United States the vessel did not call on the United States either.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.943" offset="11395762">So on every single major issue in all three cases that is, the condition of the cargo, the storage of the cargo, the seaworthiness of the vessel, the issuance of the bill of lading and the loss while all -- all of the testimony on all issues was available in foreign courts only.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.217" offset="11480816">In this case, I repeat, the cargo originated in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.194" offset="11508715">It was delivered to the ocean carrier in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.717" offset="11522821">It was loaded on board the vessel in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.797" offset="11535151">The voyage commenced in the United States and the Bills of Lading were issued in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.761" offset="11558975">Thus, on all important issues, testimony is available right here in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.735" offset="11590844">Now I'd like to get back to this question of the origin -- where the voyage originates.</text>

            <text syncTime="2980.364" offset="11921450">Thus I say, this Court has recognized the fact that where the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act or some other American law is involved and if there are sufficient reasons to keep the case in the United States that that case should be kept in the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="3256.537" offset="13026116">Those cases are the Smith, the Bennett, and the Samuels Cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.956" offset="13043775">And each of those three cases, the court found that a longshoreman employed by a ship owner and loading or unloading the ship owner's vessel was injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.666" offset="13106573">The longshoreman's right against the ship owner or his employer are governed by the longshoreman and Harbor Worker's Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.830" offset="13143249">That act provides that the longshoreman can recover in certain instances and sort of regulates the amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.242" offset="13176895">The longshoreman was not satisfied with this procedure and went against the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.119" offset="13204376">The Courts of Appeal I think for the Second and Third and the Fifth Circuit said, “That Congress, when it enacted the longshoreman on the Harbor Worker's Act intended that they ensure -- longshoreman's right should be exclusively adjudicated by the provisions of that act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.479" offset="13297894">The holding in those cases is clearly expressed in a case of Central Railroad Company of New Jersey against Burns Brothers which is referred to on page 43 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.370" offset="13345437">In that case, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit stated that Smith against (Inaudible) McDowell and Samuels against Monsoon Steamship Company on which the Central Railroad relies are irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.561" offset="13410220">They decided no more than that in a longshoremans and Harbor Worker's Compensation Act, Congress meant to make exclusive the liabilities that it (Inaudible) opposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.454" offset="13453793">And that same proposition can be applied to the Consumers Products Case or Imports Case which is referred to in the petitioner's reply brief -- I think it's in this last point.</text>

            <text syncTime="3434.923" offset="13739677">The market value is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.835" offset="13755246">The testimony in Genoa and the seventh argument is that American shippers of cargo should use American ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.417" offset="13785652">Now I say, the fact that the vessel is Genoese has absolutely no bearing on the merits of this case and can be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.393" offset="13817522">The fact that the crew members and the offices are residents of Italian -- of Italy is very important in this case because when this action was commenced, we thought the responded, Carbon Black Export Inc.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.320" offset="13869244">sought to take the testimony of those witnesses in Houston, Texas at the same time the vessel was on port.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.032" offset="13896098">Now the vessel has also returned to the United States on a number of occasions but the respondent, the petitioners here never sought to take their testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.962" offset="13931833">Thus, all of those issues, all of those issues could have been resolved if they had submitted the crew members and -- and the offices to the jurisdiction of the District Court in Texas because we could have taken their testimony and we were willing to pay for all those expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.256" offset="14008947">So I say on that point, we can discount that point because that really shows the unreasonable attitude of the petitioners where we expect that the seaworthiness of a vessel, I say that most of that testimony is available here in Houston and -- and New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.563" offset="14074149">Because in a number of five polls together with the Carbon Black, there was stone, a number of iron clumps of chemicals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.514" offset="14106018">The iron drums broke loose, crashed against the plates of the vessel and one of the plates being wasted, cracked and allowed to the entry of sea water into the hole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.749" offset="14150949">So the storage of the cargo becomes very important and that's only available at the ports of Houston and Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.376" offset="14177489">The market value and the amount of cargo damage can practically be stipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.832" offset="14199327">And the fact that a general average has been declared has no bearing on this case because if the loss in fact was occurred because the vessel was un-seaworthy on leaving the ports of Houston and Texas and the general average resulted there from, the general average is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.517" offset="14265992">So I say as against that, we have all of the testimony on condition of cargo, storage of cargo, seaworthiness of vessel and the commencement of the voyage, the issuance of the bill of lading and other -- all other important issues available right here in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.758" offset="14327014">So I say there is a great convenience but a trial of this action here in the United States and not general rhythm.</text>

            <label>Mr. E. D. Vickery</label>
            <text syncTime="3691.549" offset="14766184">May it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.460" offset="14777783">The onset I would like to say, if the petitioners -- because they attempted to get their respondent to live up to the provision of the contract, they wouldn't take testimony in this case until they got a decision of the District Court on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.887" offset="14843507">If that makes us unreasonable in connection with this litigation, then we have taken an unreasonable attitude with respect to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.241" offset="14876944">Now on the depositions of the crew in Houston, this libel was filed two days before those depositions were noticed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.477" offset="14913829">They saw them on two grounds, discovery and De bene esse under the admiralty statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.978" offset="14935876">We objected to the depositions because our first knowledge of this case in any damage came when the libel was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.925" offset="14963670">We had no information whatsoever from Italy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.438" offset="14973701">We had no opportunity to get any information to prepare for the deposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.430" offset="14989688">This matter was submitted to the United States District Court and he held in both instances that the respondent was not legally entitled to take the deposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.590" offset="15026260">Either De bene esse or as discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3759.459" offset="15037753">No further attempts were made to get these depositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.534" offset="15054054">We received one phone call in the summer of 1956 indicating that they thought the ship would be back in September and they might want to take the depositions then.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.183" offset="15092715">At that time the motion was pending before the United States District Court and no effort was made to proceed with the deposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.306" offset="15121136">I think that really is a collateral matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.347" offset="15133362">It's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.266" offset="15137019">have we not had the jurisdictional question involved in this case, this case would have long ago been tried and disposed off before the United States District Court down in Houston.</text>
            <text syncTime="3794.299" offset="15177143">But that doesn't have anything to do with the convenience of the forum for a trial of the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3801.408" offset="15205564">Now I want to allude just very briefly to the Muller Case of the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.692" offset="15226671">I think that in the Muller Case, you have just as much evidence needed in the Muller Case and the United States as you have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.797" offset="15267109">That cargo was destined for Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.390" offset="15281528">The market value of the cargo did not reach Philadelphia would have to be proved and obviously would have to be approved by the best available evidence that would be available in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.673" offset="15330638">All of the other evidence was foreign.</text>
            <text syncTime="3835.220" offset="15340878">And I think the record amply reflects that in this particular case, substantially all of the evidence is obtainable only in Italy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3844.409" offset="15377554">Now I recognize that Mr. McGowan and I don't agree on this particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3849.377" offset="15397407">What I'm saying to this court, I only wish that my duty in representing the petitioner in this case to show due diligence to make the vessel sea worthy attached in Houston and New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3862.574" offset="15450279">Boy that would be easy and I submit to this Court, I would be delighted if that was the extent of my burden in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3869.097" offset="15476297">But the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act says, “You have to prove due diligence to make the vessel seaworthy before and after commencement of the voyage.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3878.878" offset="15515481">We can't just stop by proving the condition of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3882.202" offset="15528751">At Houston, we've got to show that we have used due diligence all along the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3887.545" offset="15550171">We don't have to show that the vessel in fact was seaworthy at the time it left Houston.</text>
            <text syncTime="3892.978" offset="15571905">We only have to show that diligence was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.796" offset="15583086">It may have been un-seaworthy when it left Italy because of a latent defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3900.303" offset="15601162">But we don't have to prove it was seaworthy, we have to show our diligence and we have to show our diligence starting not in Houston and New Orleans but we have to start in Italy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.253" offset="15637002">And in all probability to make out a case, we're going to have to start with the last annual inspection of this vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3915.554" offset="15662184">Just when this was, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.065" offset="15668245">It may have been as long as eight or nine months prior to the time that the vessel broke down in Italy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.326" offset="15689247">So it's not a simple matter of offering a few witnesses in Houston or a few witnesses in New Orleans and the petitioners discharging their burden show that they used due diligence to make this vessel seaworthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3933.433" offset="15733656">Our burden is substantially greater than this and I submit to this Court on the fact the amount of evidence required in this country, in the Muller case and in this case they are almost identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3947.056" offset="15788199">Now if I may, I should like to elude you some questions previously asked by some members of the Court, particularly Mr. Justice Frankfurter made an inquiry early in the argument with respect to whether or not the shipper actually signed the bill of lading.</text>
            <text syncTime="3962.766" offset="15850998">It's true the shipper does not actually sign the bill of lading, but the shippers own broker, the shippers agent in Houston prepares the bill of lading and submits it to the vessel owner for his signature and the vessel owner issues it if it is in proper form.</text>
            <text syncTime="3977.195" offset="15908780">Now admittedly, the broker normally gets a printed form of the particular line on which he is shipping.</text>
            <text syncTime="3983.708" offset="15934798">That is the type of bill of lading that the ship owner wants and normally requires but it --</text>

            <text syncTime="4748.409" offset="18993633">My answer simply to that is simply this, that the obvious intention of the party was that it includes both in personam and in rem and if actually you don't have two causes of action, you have one cause of action as Mr. Justice Stewart has pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4766.063" offset="19064163">The recovery in personam is res adjudicata and decision in rem and you have actually the in rem proceeding as a security device for the purpose of guaranteeing the payment of any damages to which they may be entitled.</text>
