            <label>Mr. Harry L. Shniderman</label>
            <text syncTime="35.371" offset="244903">The jury awarded petitioner $76,400.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.403" offset="264965">The trial court refused to set the verdict aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.545" offset="285550">The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that the Pennsylvania Workmen's Compensation Act provided the exclusive remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.960" offset="331212">In reversing, the Court of Appeals relied on Pennsylvania state practice as to the functions of these reforms by a court and jury in determining whether there was an employment relationship covered by the Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.708" offset="410206">This procedure was in conflict with Byrd versus Blue Ridge Rural Electric Cooperative Inc., and therefore we maintain that the jury verdict should be reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.643" offset="465899">The petitioner brought this suit as administrator on behalf of Norman Ormsbee Jr.'s widow and three children.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.157" offset="511979">Ormsbee, a young man of 20, had been killed while riding on a truck owned by a man named Fidler.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.015" offset="559417">Fidler had leased the truck complete with driver to the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.217" offset="584286">The driver Schroyer had picked up a load of steel and had proceeded on what was to have been a 350-mile journey.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.997" offset="627336">Because of a combination of very unusual circumstances, what was to have been a 20-hour trip was protracted for a seven day period, at which time Schroyer had not yet reached his destination.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.689" offset="698180">Among other things Schroyer had encountered grave mechanical difficulty with the truck, and so he asked petitioner's decedent, Ormsbee, whom he had casually met in a tavern to accompany him for the balance of the trip in exchange for a promised payment of $25.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.371" offset="792848">Now it was contrary to the policy of both, Fidler the lessor, and the respondent to permit anyone to ride on the truck other than the driver.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.857" offset="842794">Ormsbee had training as a mechanic, which might have been of help in the event of the feared breakdown of the truck, but the truck crashed about five hours after Ormsbee joined Schroyer and both men were killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.465" offset="913220">The brakes of the truck were extremely defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.427" offset="929102">The evidence establishes that this defective condition resulted from the wanton negligence of the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.320" offset="968704">The law of Pennsylvania is that a defendant is liable to a trespasser only for wanton negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.787" offset="1010500">But if Ormsbee was properly present on the truck, by virtue of the emergency, the respondent would be liable even for ordinary negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.154" offset="1060028">The respondent vigorously contended that Ormsbee was a mere trespasser.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.785" offset="1082493">Because of the doubt as to Ormsbee's right to be on the truck, the jury was asked to answer four special interrogatories, as well as to return a general verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.421" offset="1137037">The jury found that there had been wanton negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.009" offset="1155427">It also found in answer to interrogatory number one, that Ormsbee was properly present on the truck, which meant that recovery could be had even for ordinary negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.073" offset="1207672">Thus the jury found in fact that Ormsbee was not a trespasser.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.498" offset="1233377">Now the precise issues tried were not framed exclusively by the compliant and answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.552" offset="1265560">They were elaborated on both sides at pre-trial, as is pointed out in the record at page 208 A of the trial judge's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.970" offset="1311222">Now as a result of this elaboration of the issues, there evolved respondent's alternative affirmative defense, that this cause of action was barred by the Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.635" offset="1369945">Now this suit is barred by the Pennsylvania Workmen's Compensation Act only if two circumstances are both present.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.111" offset="1411845">First this suit is not barred unless Ormsbee was the employee of respondent, rather than say of Fidler.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.261" offset="1460433">Second, even if Ormsbee was the employee of the respondent, this suit would not be barred if the employment was, in the words of the statute, casual and not in the regular course of the respondent's business.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.435" offset="1537128">Such temporary employees are simply not covered by the Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.840" offset="1562728">Now the respondent did not seek a jury determination of either of these two questions as to Ormsbee's employment status, although both had to be resolved in its favor in order to establish what it concedes is an affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.477" offset="1637230">The trial court stated to counsel before submitting interrogatory number one that he was purposely refraining from asking the jury to decide the employee issue, which he considered one for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.472" offset="1709223">This is what the trial court stated at page 169 A of the record in commenting on interrogatory number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.609" offset="1741824">You notice there I refrain from saying just what his status is.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.674" offset="1766066">I don't think it is necessary to have the jury find whether he was employed or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.562" offset="1789576">I think that is a question for the law, we might have to look at that afterwards, it depends on what you think of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="435.313" offset="1844642">The respondent asked of a judge for a binding instruction, that if the jury found that an emergency existed, which justified Schroyer in hiring an assistant, the verdict must be for the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.657" offset="1917994">The respondent thus tried to have the Court bind the jury without instructing the jury to consider or decide whose employee Ormsbee was or whether the employment was in the regular course of the respondent's business.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.600" offset="1997824">When this request for a binding instruction was refused, the respondent made no effort to obtain an instruction which would have permitted the jury rather than the Court to determine the employment status question.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.170" offset="2056025">Since this is important it should be stressed that the jury was never asked to consider whether Ormsbee was respondent's employee?</text>
            <text syncTime="500.077" offset="2103672">Further the respondent made no request that the statutory language, regular course of business ever be presented to the hearing of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.872" offset="2146826">Finally, the judge was not asked to present to the jury any language equivalent to regular course of business, such as the language that has been developed in the Pennsylvania decisions and which was quoted by the Court below.</text>

            <text syncTime="871.982" offset="3591293">I am not suggesting that, perhaps that is what he was doing, but he was simply saying from the very start of this record, there is nothing in this record which would indicate anything to the contrary from the opening page, that he was not going to put this employment question to the jury, that it was a question as he put it a question of the law for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.806" offset="3686588">Now after the jury returned the verdict in favor of the petitioner, the respondent moved for judgment N.O.V or for a new trial and these motions were denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.359" offset="3728802">And on appeal the Court of Appeals reversed relying on Skinner, a secondary treatise on the Pennsylvania Workman's Compensation Act, dealing with state court practice and the Court relied on Skinner for its right to determine the employee issue as a question of law, which it stated was open to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.483" offset="3817305">As you can see in a federal court case the state practice as to what is or is not open to review, was hardly an appropriate thing for the Court of Appeals to have been dealing with.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.428" offset="3877073">Now the Court of Appeals correctly defined in regular course of business as depending upon whether the employment was an ordinary operation of the respondent, or in the words of the Callahan case cited by the Court, the normal operations, which regularly constitute the business of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.971" offset="3959306">But the Court surprisingly concluded that since Ormsbee was on the truck, by virtue of the emergency, this put him into the regular business of the defendant, namely transportation of goods by truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.888" offset="4026911">Now this Court held in Byrd, that in a federal diversity case, the jury decides the fact question of whether there was employment status under the under Workman's Compensation Act, and we have the same question in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.150" offset="4092008">The Court of Appeals relied on state practice and labeled the question of Ormsbee status a question of law and under Byrd state practice simply did not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.394" offset="4144985">The jury made a special finding in answer to interrogatory one that Ormsbee was properly present on the truck, and trial court had submitted this question as he stated, both before he did it and after he did it, for the very narrow purpose of determining whether Ormsbee was a trespasser.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.768" offset="4234428">The judge carefully informed counsel that the interrogatory was not intended to present the employment question to the jury, but the Court of Appeals drew inferences to find that respondent was Ormsbee's employer and that the employment was in regular course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.782" offset="4314467">Now we do not deny that the Pennsylvania practice readily allows the drawing of such an inference as I've already said, where the fact issue is one of statuary coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.018" offset="4359398">The state cases cited in our brief show that the Court, with facility, seems to translate into and label the drawings of these inferences, labels it questions of law, but the Pennsylvania practice is certainly not basic for the statutory scheme and so the Byrd decision maybe readily applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.135" offset="4451871">Now the respondent in its brief presents many ancillary contentions, but the clear thrust of its effort to distinguish Byrd is its assertion that somehow the employment question was fully presented to the jury and was decided by the jury itself in the respondent's favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.540" offset="4549569">Now since the jury never heard of the Compensation Act as acclaimed bar to the cause of action, never heard of it, the respondent obviously has great difficulty in arguing that the jury could have decided anything with respect to the question, but concretely the jury was never told of a statutory standard that the employment must be in the regular course of the respondent's business in order to come within the coverage of the Compensation Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1150.299" offset="4704528">And that is what the Court -- that is what the respondent has done in an effort to supply the omission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.055" offset="4731591">The respondent fastens on these words in defendant's interests, which appears in interrogatory number one as Mr. Justice Whitaker read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.138" offset="4771924">The respondent asserts that these words in defendant's interests are the equivalent of regular course of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.280" offset="4812466">And from this it would follow, according to the respondent, that the jury made the determination that Ormsbee was employee in the regular course of business because his presence on the truck was in the defendant's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.441" offset="4881115">Now there is no support whatsoever in the Pennsylvania cases or in the decision below for this newly advanced contention that regular course of business and the defendant's interests are equivalent expressions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.059" offset="4947571">In the leading Callahan case which was relied on by the Court below, the repair of machinery belonging to the employer, was held not to be in the regular course of a business of the employer, although it was clearly in the employer's interest, couldn't have proceeded with his operation without the repair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.871" offset="5034820">And in the Rocco case again relied on by the Court below, the repair of the employer's restaurant ceiling was held to be not in the regular course of the employer's business, although again it obviously was in the defendant's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.047" offset="5103574">If everything in the employer's interests were held to be in the regular course of the employer's business, then clearly nothing would be excluded, and so we think it can be stated with assurance that the employment issue was in fact not determined by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.326" offset="5196675">Now the two questions as to Ormsbee's employment status, both of which had to be decided in the favor of the respondent, were on the record factual questions upon which a jury could have drawn inferences in the petitioner's favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.595" offset="5277759">First as to the question of who was the employer, the record is replete with testimony that Fidler the lessor maintained active control over the repair and maintenance of his own equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.484" offset="5345259">He garaged his equipment, he arranged for its ordinary repair by an independent contractor, even when the truck was on the road, Fidler made special trips to supply the driver with replacement tires, he hired the driver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.550" offset="5417566">He instructed the driver as to the garages to be used on the road for making emergency repairs and he paid the repair bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.273" offset="5452466">He even told Schroyer whether to -- whether he could proceed in bad weather.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.059" offset="5487574">When Schroyer hired Ormsbee in the tavern, he did so because of the eminent breakdown of the equipment, he felt he might need help.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.738" offset="5530311">Both Fidler and the respondent had a policy of not permitting riders on the truck and so the trial judge was at first quite dubious about Ormsbee's status as an authorized person on the truck, but he stated that he had been shaken in his initial impression by Fidler's testimony, that he authorized his driver while on the road to engage necessary repair and other services without consulting him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.865" offset="5670849">So it was with a view toward getting help as to tasks that Fidler had kept under his control that Ormsbee was hired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.430" offset="5713063">This pertained to the repair of equipment that belonged to Fidler and did not pertain to the driving of the truck for the transportation of goods, at least a jury could have so found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.993" offset="5775339">Now second, on the assumption that Ormsbee became the employee of the respondent could a jury have reasonably concluded that he was not engaged in the regular course of the respondent's business?</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.088" offset="5851721">Could it have been concluded that his function was not ordinary or normal, but to the contrary was extraordinary or abnormal?</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.583" offset="5909713">We believe the answer is obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.373" offset="5920893">Ormsbee was not licensed to drive a motor vehicle in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.152" offset="5943986">He was not hired to drive a motor vehicle, and in fact he did not drive it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.400" offset="5968959">This is not a case where the driver was disabled and an emergency substitute driver had to be found to take this place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.650" offset="6005948">Ormsbee was not engaged in the transportation of goods, and he patently could perform no function with respect to the load.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.391" offset="6040952">The truck contained 36,000 pounds of steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.536" offset="6057566">In the event of a breakdown, it hardly needed protection while repairs were being undertaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.678" offset="6086092">If a breakdown had occurred presumably Ormsbee would have helped in a mechanical or a related way in meeting the trouble which led to his engagement in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.708" offset="6142203">His contemplated services were the prospective handling of broken down equipment owned by Fidler.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.816" offset="6178670">Now even the ordinary repair and maintenance of the truck was not handled by Fidler and certainly not by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.408" offset="6217017">It was contracted out, this was not even an ordinary function of Fidler, but certainly the testimony shows how far removed from ordinary or normal was the transportation of Ormsbee himself in the emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.628" offset="6285876">Ormsbee's transportation was so extraordinary that the respondent was to insist throughout the trial that he was a mere trespasser.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.542" offset="6325582">A reasonable inference is that in respondent's normal operation, it provided neither roving mechanics, riding assistants, nor $25 a trip short-haul companions, and since a jury could have reasonably decided one or both of these factual issues in petitioner's favor, it was erroneous for the Court of Appeals to draw its own conclusions in reliance on Pennsylvania state practice.</text>
