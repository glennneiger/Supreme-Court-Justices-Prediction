            <text syncTime="4684.345" offset="18840743">Now here, following Your Honor's decision in the Petterson case in which, Your Honors, will recall that the shipowner was held liable for a defective block which had been brought aboard, supplied and brought aboard by the longshoreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="4696.839" offset="18890689">Following that in the case of Grillea, Judge Hand speaking for the Second Circuit had this set of facts before him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4703.021" offset="18915453">There were -- the longshoremen were engaged on that vessel at that time and replacing the hatch boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="4709.584" offset="18941680">And after some of the hatch boards had been replaced, some of the men who were engaged in that very practice stepped on one of the hatch boards which was set on top of the pot-eye and therefore unsteady, and down he went into the hole.</text>
            <text syncTime="4723.858" offset="18998836">It was conceded that it was a negligent act in putting it there by this very longshoreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="4728.234" offset="19016286">However, the Court there held that pursuant to Your Honors decision in the Petterson case, it was an unsafe condition for which the shipowner was responsible regardless of whether the condition was created by the longshoreman or by the ship -- the ship itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4743.024" offset="19075427">Now, similarly here, sir, we say that the condition which was created here whether it was by the ship or whether it was by the longshoreman was a terribly dangerous and unseaworhty one.</text>

            <text syncTime="4767.478" offset="19173334">My friend here has said that the exclusive and sole factor which was the approximate course of the accident was the negligence of the winch operator in continuing to apply pressure.</text>

            <text syncTime="4783.730" offset="19238327">Here is what Judge Hastie said which was the -- as to what was the deciding factor, “The decisive fact -- this is the second paragraph about down in the middle of the page in record, page 113, “The decisive fact as the Court found it was that the employees of the Nacirema had so changed the position of the head of the boom as to seriously distort the normal composition of forces which is presented by a straight lifting operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4811.532" offset="19349504">It was for this reason that the topping-lift was subjected to an enormous, abnormal, and unanticipated strain.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4819.680" offset="19382105">It was on a basis of that unsafe condition therefore and we urge Your Honors that on a basis of that alone there should be liability in this case.</text>
