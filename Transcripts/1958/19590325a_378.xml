          <heading>Argument of Raphael H. Weissman</heading>
          <turn speaker="raphael_h_weissman" startTime="0.000" stopTime="518.222">
            <label>Mr. Raphael H. Weissman</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">.Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.098" offset="127770">This is an appeal from contempt of court convictions made by a New York State Supreme Court justice, conducting a judicial inquiry into alleged so called ambulance chasing in Kings County, Brooklyn, New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.231" offset="224319">The appellants were sentenced 30 days to sit in prison for refusal to answer questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.259" offset="260368">Each appellant served two days and they are both enlarged in bail pending the determination of the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.269" offset="304462">Their refusal to answer these questions was based upon the fact that the justice denied or refused to allow their counsel to be present in the courtroom while they were being questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.925" offset="379068">And the appellants now make a claim on this appeal that the denial of their counsel's presence in the courtroom while they were being questioned and the appellants now make the claim on this appeal that the denial of their counsel presence in the courtroom where they were being question was a denial to them of their Fourteenth Amendment due process rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.146" offset="455973">The order of this Court of November was from the consideration of jurisdiction until the argument of the case on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.756" offset="502366">Our position on that jurisdictional aspect is that appeal does lie here as a matter of technical right, and in any event a substantial question being presented that the Court can make the decision of the question by the route of certiorari if for technical reasons, appeal fails.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.687" offset="610095">Now, on the right to come here by way of appeal, the appellants take the position that Section 90 subdivision 10 of our local judiciary law in the State of New York, as construed and applied in this case, denied them their Fourteenth Amendment due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.835" offset="702673">The section in brief provides for conduct of investigations by the appellate division of the conduct of attorneys at law.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.007" offset="755440">And one of the provisions is that until a certain stage is reached, these investigations must be made privately.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.415" offset="800998">Now in this case, the review of the commitments on the local law has to be taken by so called Article 78 proceedings, the equivalent of a common law certiorari and where a justice of the Supreme Court is involved as a party, the proceeding must be initiated in the intermediate appellate court or the appellate division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.909" offset="918967">So that the instant case started by original petitions in the appellate division of the Supreme Court for a review of these commitments.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.885" offset="966928">The appellate division in this case, dismissed the petition on the ground that there was no distinction between the case we presented and a prior case which we designate as a companion case, which had then recently been decided by the appellate division and needs to appeal had been denied by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.164" offset="1084061">In our case, the essential part of the ruling on this point is stated on page 10 of our brief and the appellate division said that we contented that our case was different from Anonymous M from the so called companion case.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.920" offset="1159084">They cite the Anonymous M case and they find that there was no difference and therefore our petitions were dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.177" offset="1192103">Now the Anonymous M case, the opinion on that or the essential portion on jurisdiction is printed on page 15 of our brief and there we say that the appellate division construed the right of the justice conducting the inquiry to exclude counsel to come out of this Section 90 subdivision 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.785" offset="1294503">The excerpt of this is a short one, it's central, and I'll read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.976" offset="1315297">The order also provided, this is from the companion case, that for the purposes of protecting the reputation of innocent persons, the said inquiry and investigation shall be conducted in private pursuant to the provisions of the judiciary law Section 90, Subdivision 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.773" offset="1394500">Then I have omitted certain portions and they conclude, it was not an abuse of discretion for the additional special term to exclude petitioner's attorney from the room while petitioner was being questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.893" offset="1450924">Now was it a violation of his constitutional rights?</text>
            <text syncTime="340.454" offset="1465240">Citing a local case which has nothing to do with it and matter of Groban then recently decided in this Court in judiciary law Section 90, so that we say that our petitions were dismissed in the appellate division on the ground that this local statute authorized the exclusion of counsel in order to maintain the statutory privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.459" offset="1593240">Now after the dismissal of our petitions in the intermediary appellate court, we took an appeal as a matter of a right to the Court of Appeals to higher State Court of New York on the ground that a constitutional question was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.372" offset="1652903">Then counsel for respondent made a motion in that court to dismiss on the ground that no substantial constitutional question was involved and the Court of Appeals granted the motion to dismiss on the ground that no substantial constitutional question was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.811" offset="1738585">It should be no different if there was no challenge to the form in which we took our appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.827" offset="1762722">It was the substance of our appeal that was thus adjudicated and we say that under the decisions of this Court that adjudication by the Court of Appeals at least for the purposes of jurisdiction is an affirmance of what was done in the appellate division.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.815" offset="1830640">Now with that as the premise, this is the way we start out our right to appeal as a technical matter under the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.440" offset="1873168">This Court will not review a construction of the statute of the state, especially in its constitutional aspect unless the court -- the higher State Court itself either had an opportunity to construe it in relation to the constitutional challenge or in fact they construe it in relation to the constitutional challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.103" offset="1975777">Now we say that the appellate division decision went up to the Court of Appeals which the Court of Appeals in effect did affirm, gave a full and complete notice that what was done here was done under this local statute, that it was challenged on the ground that would be unconstitutionality that is to say that it would deny due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.016" offset="2075460">And that the Court of Appeals had ample opportunity to say what it wanted to say in point of construction of that statute so that we say as a technical legal manner that appeal lies here because we have satisfied the rule, laid down on the cases of this Court that the highest State Court either did construe it or had a chance to construe it.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="518.222" offset="2176293">Do you specifically advise the statute -- constitutionality of the statute?</text>

            <text syncTime="522.509" offset="2193429">I did not, not in the appellate division.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.225" offset="2208266">The point I am making here is there is a bifocal approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.808" offset="2230627">Either the necessity for the challenge in the State Court as I see it Your Honor is to give the highest State Court an opportunity to construe the statute, but if even without anybody raising the question, the record as a whole shows that the decision in the higher State Court was an affirmance of our position taken on the basis of a statute, then we have the substantial or real equivalent of a decision by the higher State Court that this statute authorizes exclusion and we are here as a matter of right by route of appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="572.545" offset="2393527">Do I hear correctly that do you think the companion case Anonymous M was a different case from your case and did not govern your case, isn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="589.071" offset="2459669">Only in respect of a local matter, there was a question of discretion involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.945" offset="2479104">The appellate division had decided two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.726" offset="2490284">The appellant division didn't say that all must, all counsel must be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.876" offset="2510869">The appellate division there said that the justice at the inquiry had the right to exclude counsel over discretion to admit him.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.207" offset="2544201">The fuller text of that opinion shows that.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.379" offset="2556844">Now the distinction we make --</text>

            <text syncTime="648.259" offset="2696443">And therefore you say the misconception, it wasn't misconception, the appellate division to find Anonymous M controlling from which I draw the inference, you tell me if it were just as I believe that the statute as such does not -- does not violate or offend the Fourteenth Amendment, but the application made of it to the particular circumstances of the case which you are arguing, am I right about that?</text>

            <text syncTime="893.458" offset="3677184">They have a defined function in the scheme of negligence, litigation and settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.549" offset="3709576">Now they were subpoenaed to come before this investigation of the judicial inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.492" offset="3733295">They came with counsel and they repeatedly pointed out to the judge that before they had come in for the actual questioning, they and their counsel had been informed by a member of inquiry staff that enough evidence had already been gathered against them to submit to the district attorney, that the enquiry doesn't intend to pussyfoot with them and that is if they come clean so to speak, that will be taken into consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.430" offset="3893060">The testimony that was given by this member of the staff is found on page 115 and 116 in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.229" offset="3936319">The way he came to give the testimony was that these parties repeatedly turned to the judge and said, we are not here as witnesses, we are here as prospective defendants, we are here as targets of this investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.253" offset="4000371">We need the advice of counsel, and we were threatened they said.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.204" offset="4024195">And so the judge for the integrity of this process I suppose held a hearing to find out who threatened and when he was told especially that a member of the inquiry staff did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.898" offset="4071006">And so he heard testimony about one or two other witnesses and then came to the particular member of the staff and questioned and he was told you heard what was said and what you say about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.694" offset="4118131">And Your Honor see here, there on the page, that he tells his part of the story and he goes on to say, I don't know my exact language, but I indicated that we did not intend to pussyfoot with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.694" offset="4174137">We were not trying to trap them in any manner, but the testimony and evidence have come before us in the course of our investigation that someone and the employer Gotham Claims Service, these appellants did business on their partnership name of Gotham Claims Service, had with some frequency obtained statements from defendants holding themselves out to be from defendants carriers and also holding themselves out to be from other agencies and in one instance the district attorney's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.643" offset="4297958">That our investigation had disclosed that these statements had been tampered with and that it was these statements -- and that it was relative to this that we wish to speak to them to find out if these statements were actually taken by Gotham Claims service for what attorneys these statements were taken, and whether the tampering was done by them or their employees, or a direction of some attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.817" offset="4406627">And then he says something else, he finally says, I further stated that in my opinion there was prima facie evidence in the event that the clients decided to plead the Fifth Amendment to refer the matter to the district attorney's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.552" offset="4477576">All this had happened before these people were called into the courtroom to be questioned and in light of this they repeatedly made their protest to the judge that they want the help of counsel while they were being questioned and he nevertheless denied.</text>

            <text syncTime="1234.956" offset="5043179">Now, the reason for emphasizing this is that the brief for appellee and the position of Mr. Justice Arkwright in his answer, made very light of the whole thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1912.248" offset="7752391">If counsel is going to represent somebody, if he has a right to representation by counsel, it must be then and there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.733" offset="7782275">There's another consideration as was indicated by the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Black in the Groban case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.055" offset="7807561">This in an in-camera proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.508" offset="7821354">While it's been sanctioned in the Karlin case and never taken up higher, this is still an in-camera proceeding with all the invidious and unfortunate consequences that in-camera proceedings have to this day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.595" offset="7873703">An in-camera proceeding is not only vicious when it was conducted in history, it is infinitely more vicious in these more civilized times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.781" offset="7906513">Now in such a situation it is a very comfort and great protection for a man when he is being grilled by a judge, a large staff of counsel in the courtroom to have the guiding hand of counsel and he is entitled to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.316" offset="7976626">Now we say Your Honors that that the decisions below were rested on the misapprehension of the reach of the decision of this case in matter of Groban.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.488" offset="8037334">And while dissecting precedence is hardly a profitable undertaking in most times, in this case it will help to focus the problem down, the considerations in relation to this problem were fully developed by the three opinions in matter of Groban and we say that in substantial, realistic respect, the case of matter of Groban is based upon considerations that do not apply here and entirely different from the considerations that apply here and that in this case the man was entitled to his counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.284" offset="8204518">Now there were the three opinions, one by Mr. Justice Reed and there was a concurring opinion by Mr. Justice Frankfurter and there was the dissenting opinion by Mr. Justice Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.176" offset="8256031">First I think it is profitable to see that the considerations that moved the prevailing opinion of Mr. Justice Reed are entirely absent and different here and I shall show that even the concurring opinion was based on considerations that has applied to the circumstances of this case would warrant a holding here, require a holding here, the counsel should have been allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.789" offset="8366477">In the first place, we had in the Groban case, a fire marshal making an investigation of causes of a fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.030" offset="8415483">Perhaps the situation as you view it as a whole (Inaudible), but practically through the imagination you could see that one cannot compare, considerations applying to the investigation of a fire by a fire marshal to hearing in the courtroom, the old appellate division courtroom with bench as long as this, Judge in a courtroom outside as lighted up as this courtroom with a large staff of counsel on one side having a man in there and he is not to be represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.386" offset="8560933">The situations are entirely different in the, and the difference is even shown in the very open book of our language.</text>

            <text syncTime="2126.359" offset="8608789">The fire marshal is in a hurry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.859" offset="8618820">He has to do things quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.279" offset="8628537">It didn't happen to be in that case that it was done in such a hurry but the ruling had to be made on a basis that he would exercise his power this way and that way Your Honors kind of made a ruling for every hour of these function, but he was a fire marshal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.329" offset="8692694">He may have to run with some people right down and while things are smoldering and find out what's the cause of the fire and in such circumstances to require representation and perhaps some reasonable time for preparation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.286" offset="8752567">It violates the essential function involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.484" offset="8769285">We have no such problem here and this is a long investigation, judicial investigation, hearings in a courtroom presided over by a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.203" offset="8812231">We don't have that kind of hurry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.763" offset="8826441">Now in the Groban case it was prominently stated both in the majority opinion and Mr. Justice Frankfurter's concurring opinion that all that you had there was that the man who came here to this Court and complained, said that he suspected or that there was a suspicion against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.378" offset="8932916">And both Mr. Justice Reed's opinion and Mr. Justice Frankfurter's opinion had worded to the fact that this was not anything aimed at a man who have been accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.805" offset="8978578">There was a suspicion and Mr. Justice Reed pointed out in that case that the suspicion that was -- they had argued before this Court, was without even any (Inaudible) or any proof or any affidavit to sustain the fact that the fire marshal had any suspicion against the man involved in Groban.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.651" offset="9061961">And you have no such problem here because before the questioning commenced, the very judge was informed in that proceeding that his assistant had already told the man that they had gathered against him evidence, prima facie evidence sufficient to make out a crime and we won't pussyfoot with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.550" offset="9149524">If you don't play ball we'll send it to the district attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.794" offset="9162585">So that in the Groban case you had a suspicion, and here you have a man who in every real sense of the word and its meaning in the English language was accused.</text>

            <text syncTime="2324.452" offset="9401135">There is another aspect of the investigation and will involve the Murchison situation because this judge sits in a dual capacity explicitly under the (Inaudible).</text>

            <text syncTime="2341.916" offset="9471039">He investigates and he adjudicates, but that problem is not involved in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.124" offset="9495907">This is solely the question of right of representation by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.937" offset="9515133">Now in another point that was made in the prevailing opinion in Groban was that in any event, if anything was done unfairly to extract evidence from the person who ultimately is charged with crime that can be shown upon a subsequent prosecution at the prosecution level as a basis for a plea to exclude like in the general considerations of the forced evidence or involuntary evidence of whether there was something on there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.193" offset="9652120">Now that's the very important thing to remember because in this case these people had no such chance whatever, these people are called to give evidence before a justice of the Supreme Court and under our local practice act and under the common law everywhere, when you give evidence in court (Inaudible) that's it, you have no more defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.867" offset="9746892">You can't impeach that in any subsequent trial except on relevancy, but I mean as to it's -- the genuineness of the evidence that was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.168" offset="9792031">Now in the concurring opinion written by Mr. Justice Frankfurter, emphasis was laid on the fact that the statute there was not aimed at suspect and the thought was developed from which I rely here to some extent, that if there are differences, as I read the opinion, the concurring opinion it reserved on the decision made and the concurring opinion as I read it, and this sounds probably I'm sure to Mr. Justice Frankfurter, because he knows what he wrote and I'm just reading it and imagining the (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.457" offset="9977187">That was no general warrant in the Groban case to investigate people without counsel, no matter how near you get to the suspect line and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.055" offset="10027551">And Mr. Justice Frankfurter there wrote the sentence that if there are differences in degree a due regard for due process requires that those differences be given their significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.120" offset="10095888">Now here we don't have any differences of degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.807" offset="10106650">We have a substantially different situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.353" offset="10120756">We have a court process and not a fire marshal's investigation or anybody else's investigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2584.653" offset="10441958">I point out that in fact according to that record and this the danger here was infinitely greater than it was there and then I point out as a matter of law, the judicial process that the court has to take account of the way things are done in life, that what the court may have to reluctantly yield to a fire marshal it doesn't at all have to either reluctantly or yield to a judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="2663.632" offset="10757935">Maybe if a fire marshal comes back here or a fire marshal's case where the thing had been over for six or eight weeks, maybe Your Honors might think that the considerations of fine even to a fire marshal should not apply to a situation six or eight weeks later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.370" offset="10828884">I do not say that our man was in less danger, if he were before one or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.634" offset="10857932">What I said about the fire marshal was try to read the considerations that the judicial process has to wrestle with in concrete situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.744" offset="10898369">Now what it says about a fire marshal is one thing, what it says about a judge, holding a hearing in an open court with a large staff of counsel on another side is another thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.851" offset="10946748">But further my distinctions go in showing that in point of fact the facts disclosed by that record showed an infinitely less situation of danger requiring protection than ours.</text>

            <text syncTime="3575.938" offset="14407137">And Your Honors will note that it's in the matter of the petition of the Brooklyn Bar Association that this investigation was launched into unprofessional conduct by attorneys and others acting in concert with them in Kings County.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.432" offset="14477145">Now there's the order on page 27.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.829" offset="14490728">Then on page 28, the order sets forth the scope of the inquiry, and the scope of the inquiry as set forth therein under the various paragraphs one, two, three, four with respect to alleged improper practices and abuses by attorneys and counselors at law, with respect to alleged, corrupt and unethical practices including the practice of solicitation in obtaining retainers, and in the subsequent prosecution and disposition of claims with respect to any other practice involving professional misconduct, fraud, deceit corruption, crime, misdemeanor and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.608" offset="14661778">Then the order provides that Judge Arkwright be appointed to conduct this additional special term with full power to compel the attendance of witnesses, their testimony under oath, the production of books and papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.622" offset="14729906">That it was to begin on the 22nd of January 57, and then – I, an attorney and counselor at law, who has been duly designated by the Brooklyn Bar Association is designated to aid the justice in the conduct of the inquiry and in the prosecution of the investigation pursuant to the provisions of the judiciary law set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.147" offset="14839933">Then the last paragraph concerning privacy as you will notice from the introductory words is for the purpose of protecting the reputation of innocent persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.223" offset="14908270">Now immediately following the order – oh and the one other very important factor, the last directory paragraph states that upon the conclusion of the inquiry and investigation, the justice shall make and file with this Court, that is with the appellate division, his report setting forth his proceedings, his findings and his recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.932" offset="15019133">In other words, going back to very first case in New York that I know of where such an inquiry was ordered on the application of the association of the bar of the City of New York in the first department in 1928, in that case the appellate division said and I cited the case in my brief, Matter of Association of the Bar, that is the leading case, and in that case, the court said that the -- it had inherent power to order this investigation, but it also had statutory power to order such an inquiry, a preliminary investigation as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.827" offset="15198647">And the court said, that because the appellate division by virtue of Section 90 of the judiciary law, which is printed in my brief for the convenience of the court immediately following the order Appendix B on page 30, in this statute in the judiciary law Section 90, plenary power as I can see that is vested in the appellate division although the conduct of attorneys they have regulatory control, disciplinary control over attorneys, which incidentally as I understand it from Judge Cardozo's opinion goes back to some 300 years in England, with the Inns of Court where the justices delegated their power to the members of the Inns of Court, all of which is very elaborately set forth in Chief Judge Cardozo's opinion in the Karlin case that's been referred to here.</text>

            <text syncTime="5540.202" offset="22264142">The point that I'd like to make in that connection is where my assistant said first he talked about the fact that we were interested primarily in attorneys, we were looking into the conduct of attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="5555.479" offset="22325269">And he wanted to know whether these young men, licensed private detectives, whether they had taken these statements, for what attorney's statements were taken, and whether the tampering was done by them or their employees or at the direction of some attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="5576.344" offset="22408756">So that he was indicating that we were primarily interested in lawyers and what lawyers did.</text>
            <text syncTime="5582.428" offset="22433102">Then he goes on and he says I further stated that in my opinion there was prima facie evidence in the event that the clients decided to plead the Fifth Amendment to refer this matter to the district attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="5597.304" offset="22492557">Now my friend in this Court and courts below and the other attorney for these appellants in the courts below say that that was a threat of prosecution by the district attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="5610.811" offset="22546578">Well I think if you study that language carefully and honestly this is what I believe my assistant had in mind since we were concerned with the conduct of these attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="5622.467" offset="22593285">I further stated in my opinion it was prima facie evidence in the event the clients decided to plead the Fifth Amendment invoked their, rather than it should have been the New Yorker constitution, but to invoke that constitutional privilege to refer the matter to the district attorney for prosecution, I don't think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5642.410" offset="22673011">We wanted these men to talk and I think that that language is far more susceptible.</text>
            <text syncTime="5648.916" offset="22699029">Though I am going to take, I am going to take for granted in this argument what my, what my adversary says it means but I think it's far more susceptible of the proposition that these young men would probably say to the district attorney in order to obtain immunity from prosecution rather than, rather than they were going to be sent there to be convicted for crime, because that wouldn't do our inquiry any good.</text>

            <text syncTime="5685.704" offset="22846151">His answer was, my recollection of the facts as they took place on December 4th was that following Mr. Zangara, this is on top of page 115, was that following Mr. Zangara being before the court and asking for an adjournment that he and his clients approached me in the outer foyer outside the courtroom and Mr. Zangara as spokesman for the group, asked me exactly what was wanted of his clients in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5716.451" offset="22969135">I, at that time, told Mr. Zangara that all, I don't know my exact language, but I indicated that we did not intend to pussyfoot with them.</text>

            <text syncTime="6870.070" offset="27583613">Only when it became apparent that they no longer witnesses, but defendants, targets of the investigation, then they were entitled to counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="6917.690" offset="27774098">I think the counsel ought to produce here for the information of this Court the final report of Mr. Justice Arkwright, and that will tell you precisely the number of witnesses, the number of people who were targets of the investigation, what can they do with the evidence and how it is done.</text>
            <text syncTime="6934.494" offset="27841390">And it will clarify the question asked by Mr. Justice Whittaker as to whether there is some intervening discretion involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="6941.583" offset="27869706">Even if they were, the case is not much weaker than it was, but now it been made perfectly clear, and I think the report ought to be produced so the Court should have it, that there is no intervening discretion.</text>
