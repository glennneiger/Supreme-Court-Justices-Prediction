            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="6.100" offset="127770">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.476" offset="145324">I'd like to proceed at this point briefly to call attention to the procedures in instituting an immigration deportation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.290" offset="200495">Prior to the 1956, it was a regularly a procedure to take every petitioner or person who was to be deported into custody and you recall that the Court dealt with that a number of times.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.540" offset="261517">I think the last case was in Carlson against Landon.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.071" offset="279698">Now, I don't mean that the -- this question of whether it was under the Fourth Amendment was ever squarely raised before the Court and it was not, but, if you will recall that in Carlson against Landon, the issue of bail was raised and there was a division in the Court and certainly, it was said that it was a civil proceeding in that case and it was a clear implication that if there was anything wrong with it being a civil proceeding that it certainly would be raised and the Court in – back, as far as Fong Yue Ting said in -- in dicta that the Constitution as to searches and seizures and a number of other things did not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.082" offset="491708">Now I don't mean for a moment that this Court cannot properly now examine that question squarely, because it has not has been before the Court squarely except now with the caveat that we don't think it's properly here now.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.222" offset="556283">But, it is a matter of constitutional question that the Court can always properly examine on its own unless, as we've try to point out there's some factors that does result and do result in unfairness in this particular proceeding to have it raised at this late date.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.421" offset="649070">But, I want to deal with it squarely anyway and try to show that we -- we would satisfy the requirements even if the Fourth Amendment did apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.706" offset="698180">Now --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="149.077" stopTime="186.058">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="149.077" offset="699643">Well, that -- doesn't that characterization of the deportation proceeding against is a civil proceeding cut both ways insofar as the Government arguing this concern, if it is a civil proceeding, would it follow that the -- that it was contemplated that that should be able to -- should entitle the Government to -- to eliminate the necessity for search warrants to arrest for a serious crime?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="186.058" stopTime="351.571">
            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="186.058" offset="847600">Well, I think that if there was nothing about this procedure that would require taking into custody the way it is done, then I think the incidence to that procedure that the courts have recognized that officers have a right to do, could not be recognized as proper and legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.382" offset="956897">But taking into custody, as I see it, for a person who is being deported is just as -- has all of the elements of an arrest for a criminal proceeding insofar as the problems dealing with trying to keep that person in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.970" offset="1043205">And that's -- that's the reason that the courts have recognized since the early English cases, that once you arrest a man, and you're going to take him into custody, you have to have certain powers to go with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.215" offset="1100257">Now, if you think -- are satisfied by our argument that they are comparable and parallel in that regard, then I think you would say regardless of how you characterize this particular proceeding, civil or quasi-civil or -- or criminal, you still have to have the power to do these, the kind of searches to protect the officers and maintain your custody that you do for any other kind of a proceeding where you have to take into custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.417" offset="1241004">Now, that's what we're trying to point out in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.234" offset="1256260">We think that there's no difference between the problem of the officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.187" offset="1276113">This is an extreme case because I think we could all concede that a man that's taken into custody that has for a deportation offense, but is an active spy for a foreign government would do all he could where the penalties are so great as they are for that as well as the deportation problem for him to get away.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.992" offset="1375378">Because, if he could get over either border, with the kind of materials that he had developed for himself to try to conceal the fact that he was not properly within the country, he would be protected against the deportation or the -- or anything else that would result from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.006" offset="1455417">So, his desire to do away with the officer or do anything he could with any kind of a weapon that he could get, seem to me would be just as great as any kind of a criminal that you would pick out.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="351.571" stopTime="402.011">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="351.571" offset="1509648">I was wondering what -- what your thought would be concerning what Mr. Donovan suggested that if we say that an administrative warrant of this kind was adequate to support a search such as had been made here, that it would no longer be necessary for them to use the search procedure, I mean, added to the use of search warrant procedure in any subversive cases involving aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.905" offset="1639006">All they have -- all they have to do is just issue -- issue a deportation warrant, go in and search the place for -- for evidence of subversion and -- and entirely avoid the search and seizure clause of Constitution.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="402.011" stopTime="508.851">
            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="402.011" offset="1711417">Well, I don't think that that follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.241" offset="1720299">I think if the courts -- either Court before this or this Court was satisfied that that's all this proceeding was, that this was just a device or scheme by means of which they went in for one purpose in order to get evidence for another purpose, but then under your holdings, you'd have to hold that the search was improper, entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.826" offset="1818728">So, he is assuming that kind of a conclusion as a justification for the legal conclusion, but if you assume it was in good faith, and that it was done for the purposes of deportation, then it seems to me it fits in as a parallel to the cases that the Court has dealt with where you go in for one purpose the mere fact that you discover all kinds of criminal evidence -- not evidence but instruments of criminality at the time you're in there lawfully, doesn't mean that the officer has to walk away and say, “I'm not interested in what anybody can do to the United States or in criminal way by reason of these instruments -- I -- I just close my eyes to those things.”</text>
            <text syncTime="479.164" offset="2020080">Now, the courts have said before that if you go there for -- in ordinary civil matters and you discover those particular things that are instruments of a crime or contraband, you don't have to turn your back on them and you can pick them up, but, I think his statement assumes that this is done in bad faith and if it was, then I think that your -- that Harris would -- wouldn't permit anything like that.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="508.851" offset="2138781">But here, why couldn't --why couldn't they have said, “Now you come along with us Mr. Abel, we're going to take you into custody and then leave the officers there and -- and get a search warrant and search the place in a regular manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.078" offset="2207640">What -- what burden would that put on the Government?</text>

            <text syncTime="529.537" offset="2221537">Well, there isn't any question Mr. Chief Justice but what, there was time in this case to get a search warrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="567.775" offset="2374510">We probably wouldn't have the -- the lawsuit at least about that, but if this was a criminal case, in the start, as I read -- read the decisions of this Court, you wouldn't have to get a warrant even if you had time and could.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.554" offset="2437622">You see, that was the issue in Trupiano that the Court overruled and held that you didn't, even though you could, have to get it, if it was a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.773" offset="2486418">Now, all I'm trying to say is that if we -- we deal with that as still being the law of the Court, unless the Court decides that it wants to go to some other rule, and we shouldn't have a rule that applies to this kind of a case that's less of -- it's some kind of less than a criminal case, but is more strict than a criminal, is all I say and if this was just an ordinary criminal case, or any kind of a crime, the most extreme that you could have under the laws of the United States, you wouldn't have to go and get a warrant to make the search and seizure even though you had time under the decisions of this Court, if you were properly there and if the -- there is -- items were under the control of the -- as the Court has read it, of the petitioner or the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1980.440" offset="8025109">That you then have a right to search the person and what's within his control and you have the right to seize -- those are two factors anything that's an instrumentality to the crime or contraband or a means of escape.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.239" offset="8104312">Now, I do -- would like to call the Court's attention to the fact that the Government is not in a -- unfair or bad position in regard to the procedures in regard to deportation action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.065" offset="8175679">That it is a fair proceeding that since 1956 only, arrests have been only instituted in cases where it's either necessary or desirable under the regulations and that has to be decided by the District Director or his deputy and obviously, a case like this is one where that we would certainly agree that was both necessary and desirable to take into custody anybody who was then engaged in espionage activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.050" offset="8323532">But, and in addition to that, there has to be a prima facie case instead of -- case of only probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.119" offset="8359894">So, then an effort has been made by the Congress and the Government to have a completely fair proceeding in regard to deportation matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.402" offset="8412975">And this Court has not squarely passed upon that but in Carlson against Landon, the Court did say that it was obvious that if you're going to deport a man, you'll have to take him into custody and refer to the statute where the Attorney General was given that power to act under an administrative warrant and didn't squarely pass on it but certainly by inference, recognized that it was a valid procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="2496.131" offset="10087946">Or, if they failed to -- if the Court failed to do it, then the Government could have done it in light of the overwhelming evidence that they had and avoided any complaint of error at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.916" offset="10155029">The seven items are a very small part of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.908" offset="10171016">We -- the Government concedes that the three items or two in the waste basket, and the one he tried to slip up to his sleeve, would be prejudicial because those are the very kind of things that espionage agents use, the alienage materials that he had which were the spurious and fictitious birth certificates including another vaccination certificate and the savings bank book were all cumulative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.909" offset="10295045">The Government had overwhelming evidence in regard to all of those different activities prior to the time that there was -- the search was made for those and the seizure was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.847" offset="10342797">They had the knowledge of his bank account that he had a ledger account, that he had signature cards under the name Goldfus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.808" offset="10382608">They had knowledge of the fact that -- and they've proved all this in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.601" offset="10405804">That he was renting and had lease on the 14th Street property under the name of Goldfus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.537" offset="10433494">They had the evidence with regard to the Latham Hotel in fact that he rented or took that room under the name of Collins.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.728" offset="10470275">They had the fact that all the testimony of Hayhanen about his activities as both Gold -- Goldfus and Collins.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.579" offset="10509667">They had the fact that he had suggested to Hayhanen that he would procure for him and did procure a fictitious birth certificate for him that could be used to conceal the fact that he was, that Hayhanen was illegally within the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.895" offset="10590960">They had Hayhanen's statements to them that the petitioner was illegally in the country and had told him so that he had these means by which to try to establish his identity -- identity as a citizen if the question came up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.181" offset="10676120">They had the statements of Hayhanen that he -- could escape across the border if the question came up as to the fact that he was illegally within the country as an alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.338" offset="10732753">All of those things, they had in proof in the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.732" offset="10750307">Now, I'm not saying that these weren't of some evidence, but I don't think they added very much when you add all the evidence that the Government had in regard with alienage question and his activities as far as these four items that were not obtained from the waste basket or from his sleeve.</text>

            <text syncTime="2689.040" offset="10859499">After he left -- that the record is clear that after they left, the FBI went to the manager of the hotel and asked Kehoe to search the waste basket in the room and they proceeded to do it and these items were items that were concealed as you probably recall from the record the code book and the microfilm were contained in the -- in this pencil that could be taken apart and the sand -- sanding block that could be taken apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.074" offset="11015711">So, they had to take these items which were not obviously contraband or instruments of illegal action and take them and examine them in a laboratory to see how they could be -- whether they can be taken apart and just how because it was very skillfully done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.789" offset="11098572">They also had of course evidence of this petitioner's using these kinds of instruments, a large number of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.941" offset="11143084">In regard to communications, they found in one of the drops the -- one of the messages that he had sent but nobody picked up and it just happened that someone apparently of the park people had cemented over the place where the drop was left and this bolt that could be taken apart that have been left there with the message in it but apparently it was a message between Hayhanen and the petitioner in regards to some of their activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.010" offset="11275368">So, that they had all of that -- that evidence in regard to this case to just add these items on to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.268" offset="11328449">Now, it seems obvious to the Government that to us in behalf of the Government that if there was a serious question raised about whether there was probable cause or whether the arrest could be made at that time and they have brought it up with the -- all of these issues about the Fourth Amendment and so forth that it would not have been wise and that the Government would have -- would not have proceeded to use those items when it had so much other evidence in this case of the espionage activities and everything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.806" offset="11466585">And so, then, we come to the question of whether the Court can properly examine and of course I concede that the Court can always examine a constitutional question, but in regard to a matter of this kind, whether it's properly here, you said in the past that unless it was a constitutional question where you think that it will reflect unfairly as to the conduct of judicial proceedings, or if it's an obvious misconstruction of the law, and matters of that kind that you would not go back and examine here errors that were not properly called to the attention of the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.013" offset="11667414">And you said the reason for that is that it's unfair that the litigants should raise their questions before the lower courts so they have an opportunity to pass upon them, and also it's in the public interest to try to settle these matters without having them go on indefinitely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.408" offset="11749021">And there isn't any reason why these questions couldn't have been properly raised in the lower court if they had seen fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.658" offset="11786010">So, we think that that alone will be accumulative character of this evidence, the -- such positions are not properly raised here and should not be considered because they are not developed in this Court under the rules that you have generally adhered to with regard to such matters.</text>

            <text syncTime="3488.923" offset="14059081">And this was corroborated by one of the FBI agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.068" offset="14075695">But I'm just pointing out Your Honor that under this regulation, it says, “Notice of right to counsel and release from custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.016" offset="14107460">On service of the warrant of arrest, the alien shall be advised of his right to representation by counsel, at no expense to the Government at the hearing to be held under the warrant of arrest.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.266" offset="14152391">And so too, as amended that this so far as I know is still a procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.569" offset="14173602">This again Justice Harlan, in the event of a deportation proceeding, this again would be something that would have to be brought into a great detail, but I'm just -- just pointing that out and with respect to his knowing his rights under these circumstances of course is absurd.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.580" offset="14249671">Now this argument, Justice Brennan, about the fact that a crime was being committed in the presence of the arresting officers, this isn't a fraud and this -- this is a new thought in the Government side.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.325" offset="14304632">This cuts two ways because if that was so, under the Harris case, they had a great duty to have with that foreknowledge to have obtained a warrant for the man's arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.699" offset="14362206">Now, with respect to how general was the seizure, I can't make it more unqualified than this.</text>

            <text syncTime="3590.946" offset="14467114">You will find that the papers that I drew at that time objected to every item which they seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.799" offset="14494595">Now, before this -- the trial commenced, Judge Byers in what's a perfect normal thing, said, “Well, with how many items are we dealing?”</text>

            <text syncTime="3657.225" offset="14732309">We divided these items for your convenience into one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.428" offset="14749132">Item C is at the Latham which were introduced as exhibits of the espionage trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="4321.358" offset="17388753">But on the other hand, do we want so efficient a counter intelligence in the United States as the Gestapo or La Chica.</text>
            <text syncTime="4332.164" offset="17432012">This is an inherent part of democracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4336.954" offset="17451238">And I suggest to this Court that in deciding this question, which I would assume is the only reason this Court would have taken certiorari in this case, that in deciding that question that the Court advert to the argument which I've made in my original argument, and that is that even as a matter of national defense, the most important thing to United States today is to maintain our way of life in a free society held out to the other nations of the world that they have something to aspire to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4374.969" offset="17603271">Now, I say that kind of a way of life is the kind of way of life that is threatened in precisely this case and that violates a democracy that was created by people who had fled from precisely this kind of thing and who carefully provided in the Fourth Amendment the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizure shall not be violated and no warrant shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="4417.604" offset="17773798">That kind of simple language is what created the society we live in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4423.102" offset="17795741">That rule has been violated in this case, and I respectfully ask that the judgment below must be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4429.981" offset="17823326">Thank you.</text>
