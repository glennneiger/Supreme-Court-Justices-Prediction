            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Mr. Segal, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bernard G. Segal</label>
            <text syncTime="8.644" offset="137906">Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.792" offset="142503">I was just in the midst, when the recess came, of addressing myself to Mr. Justice Harlan's inquiries concerning the MacKay case.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.341" offset="188688">I had pointed out that that was quite a different type of regulated party than in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.164" offset="216064">In that case, it involved a regulated common carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.444" offset="241142">Well, of course it's different in many ways from the one involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.825" offset="262666">And all the Court held there was that the Federal Communications Commission could not grant the application of MacKay solely in order to increase competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.573" offset="317628">That couldn't be the sole standard it used regardless of other factors where a telegraph common carrier was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.047" offset="347512">But I might point out there quite different from the position taken by the Solicitor General here today and I quote from the Government's brief in this Communications Commission case, “It has settled laws,” said the Government there, “that the public interest embraces national policies reflected in general legislation and judicial decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.000" offset="431417">Thus, the national policy in favor of competition which is reflected in the antitrust laws becomes a part of -- becomes a part of any statute which sets forth a public interest standard.”</text>
            <text syncTime="95.256" offset="484394">Now, Your Honors, I was going through the stipulation and I'm almost through with it, I've gotten through the point that they had all the evidence on all of the antitrust issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.268" offset="520443">They had a duty to consider the antitrust issues and I come to paragraph 9, which says not only did they have a duty to consider but the FCC decided all issues relating to the exchange which it could lawfully decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.819" offset="582614">It left nothing -- left nothing undecided.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.420" offset="597034">And then the question is, well, might could have been invalid, might have not be pursuant for the Act when we come to paragraph 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.231" offset="632247">The FCC granted the exchange applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.209" offset="644159">It was argued, the date is given.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.942" offset="651160">Its action was a valid exercise of its jurisdiction and was taken pursuant to and in accordance with the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.917" offset="691075">So, there's no question about the validity of what is here in issue as I shall show.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bernard G. Segal</label>
            <text syncTime="154.263" offset="720436">I say to Your Honors that the stipulation was batted out by the Government and by us.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.525" offset="741439">What happened was, we were in a long, long hearing before the judge and the Government was present.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.379" offset="764844">And saying that all the facts are simple and I was saying, “Well, would you concede this fact?”</text>
            <text syncTime="169.771" offset="782503">And the Government said, “Yes, we would concede it, we think it's present.”</text>
            <text syncTime="172.488" offset="793370">“Would you concede this fact?”</text>
            <text syncTime="174.317" offset="800684">And in that way, the transcript was gotten up and finally, it happened that I left for the meeting of the American Bar Association in London and I couldn't participate in my associates and the -- the members of Department of Justice got up a stipulation which Judge Kirkpatrick read and approved as being in accord with the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.771" offset="894412">And by the way, for some reason, I don't understand that too has been put in the transcript of the record -- of testimony in this case by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.256" offset="928371">They have certified it up as part of the transcript of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.149" offset="939969">All that argument and all our argument below is somehow rather has crept up into this transcript.</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="215.108" offset="963793">Do you think if the stipulation as to the duty of the Commission under the statute is binding?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bernard_g_segal" startTime="220.741" stopTime="304.495">
            <label>Mr. Bernard G. Segal</label>
            <text syncTime="220.741" offset="986363">I think, Your Honor that quite clearly it's not binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.039" offset="1003499">I think it's correct, and I think to the extent that it shows that here are two litigants whose horns are locked in battle, who have divergent interest, agree that this is the law, is at least persuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.165" offset="1056057">That if the Department of Justice and counsel for RCA and NBC think it's the holding, at least to enlighten me of what it is Your Honor that it is, I agree it's not binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.226" offset="1096286">I may say to you that I think all of the stipulations except perhaps that part of it, relate the to the fact that are not involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.815" offset="1134634">The -- paragraph 11 I referred to and it just shows that we did exchange in for -- that the FCC and the Department did exchange information, but more than that, that the Department kept -- the Depart -- Federal Communications Commission kept the Department fully informed.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.781" offset="1206523">Paragraph 12, I shall not belabor, that simply is a statement of all of the four or five procedures that the Department of Justice couldn't take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.476" offset="1253230">It didn't have to come in the beginning of the proceeding when maybe it didn't know what was on.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.847" offset="1270784">It could have come in at any stage of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.423" offset="1281024">It could have asked for a hearing, it could have filed a protest in the 30 days after the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.428" offset="1301086">It could have filed a petition for rehearing and then could have taken an appeal for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.573" offset="1317700">And finally on --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="304.495" offset="1321357">Could it, Mr. Segal, have asked the FCC to defer its decision pending of further investigation demanded by the Department of Justice?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bernard_g_segal" startTime="313.538" stopTime="389.060">
            <label>Mr. Bernard G. Segal</label>
            <text syncTime="313.538" offset="1357511">I assume it could but I want to emphasize here, Your Honor that I can see a very good reason for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.638" offset="1377886">Actually, my friend, the Solicitor General has talked about the statutory practices in good -- this is a governed capsule transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.966" offset="1415189">And the reason in answer to who wrote the stipulation that Mr. Justice Whittaker asked, the reason of stipulation was not difficult to get to at, is it -- with such a simple statement of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.034" offset="1451551">Here, two companies had a transaction and here they agreed on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.947" offset="1467120">And here, the FCC had said that the affiliation was a two-year proposition and RCA had -- NBC had the right either to renew it or not to renew it.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.140" offset="1511946">Now, to answer Mr. Justice Stewart's question very directly, the fact was that the parties had come to an agreement and there were no other facts that the Department of Justice had to look into, but had the Department needed more time, the record is clear it didn't because they discovered no facts but the FCC didn't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.289" offset="1612570">I haven't the remotest doubt that the Communications Commission would have grant time.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.524" offset="1633468">And they say, Your Honors, it took seven months if it was, to decide this case from the date of application to the time we could make our exchange.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="389.060" offset="1659591">There's one other thing, Mr. Segal.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.200" offset="1664188">As I -- and I -- did I correctly understand you to state as to say at the outset of your argument that in -- on many, many occasions, the Department of Justice has intervened in cases of this nature before the Federal Communications Commission.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bernard_g_segal" startTime="401.993" stopTime="499.267">
            <label>Mr. Bernard G. Segal</label>
            <text syncTime="401.993" offset="1711313">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.320" offset="1716642">This Court has had just quite recently the, (Inaudible) case where the Department of Justice, even where they had the power to grant exemption, where the Department of Justice went in and carried the proceeding before the Federal Maritime Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.237" offset="1776306">The McLean Trucking case where the associated trucking tried to absorb six or seven companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.555" offset="1797622">The Department of Justice Antitrust Commission went in before the Interstate Commerce Commission and tried the case to argue that it would be a violation of the antitrust laws for them to perform for the ICC to authorize this.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.673" offset="1858017">It would -- it -- it's not at all unusual in our jurisprudence more than to come into these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.869" offset="1882885">Now, I don't think they come in to this case but neither, Your Honor, have they filed this kind of proceeding anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.836" offset="1914755">I take it that it's simply because they haven't taken the position that the very grant of a permit or a license which is what they're taking here is the grant of the license that they say as I shall show, violates the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.085" offset="1959685">And not all this extraneous business that's been talked about and I want to get to the complaint in a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.557" offset="1981628">It's the back that the department now takes the position that in granting the application, ipso facto, a violation to antitrust law was authorized in perpetrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.088" offset="2027708">I would take it if there's a conspiracy here that as much a conspirator would be -- well I -- I believe that I was going to say that the Department didn't act.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.759" offset="2070444">The FCC did act.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.572" offset="2077654">We acted pursuant to it and if there's any conspirator, I take it we're not one.Now --</text>

            <text syncTime="519.078" offset="2179636">I can persuade Your Honors that the -- when the FCC approved this transaction and when the parties -- and that's paragraph 13, I was getting through in the stipulation which says that, “We acted in reliance on the determination and affecting the exchange.”</text>
            <text syncTime="537.075" offset="2251630">When we did act in reliance on that determination and that's paragraph 13 of the stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.373" offset="2272841">When we acted in reliance when the time to appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia had expired, when the Department of Justice and everyone else with full knowledge of all of the facts refrained from doing anything and when we went ahead and effected these large business transactions involving the uprooting of people from Philadelphia to Cleveland and Cleveland to Philadelphia and all the rest of what's in Judge Kirkpatrick's opinion, then the Department lost its right to say that the very transaction approved by the Federal Communications Commission, it could ask the District Court to disapprove.</text>

            <text syncTime="583.567" offset="2437622">The -- the facts within the knowledge of the Government now might be the same as they were at the time that they were asked to come into the case by the Federal Communications Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="619.934" offset="2583071">But if this field is a field in which any government agency needs more than the time that Congress has prescribed, then it's for Congress to enlarge the time.</text>

            <text syncTime="662.845" offset="2754748">I may say to you that I think the Department of Justice had more than adequate time and subsequent events have so demonstrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.385" offset="2784946">And while I'm on that question, I may ask to answer the question Mr. Justice Douglas asked which was followed up by another question from Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>

            <text syncTime="1529.374" offset="6220884">This was what it had presented to it in the form of testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.139" offset="6235930">And having had it presented to it in the form of testimony, the Federal Communications Commission said “No, we conclude that there isn't anything conspiratorial here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.357" offset="6268844">We see nothing improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.960" offset="6275218">We find no coercion such as might possibly be charged, then we therefore find it to be in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.086" offset="6307715">And therefore necessarily not a violation of the antitrust law for them to own this particular station and operate it in the City of Philadelphia.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.040" offset="6347525">Now, the -- the fundamental proposition of what we say here Your Honor is, that when the FCC determines that a transaction is in the public interest, meets the standard of public interest which is the primary function which the Congress gave to the Federal Communications Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.925" offset="6439058">What is its primary function here?</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.368" offset="6444805">To license people and to license them, how?</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.196" offset="6456195">To license them if they meet the public standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.006" offset="6467375">Now, that is the keystone, that's the keystone of the system and having created the Federal Communications Commission to make that finding, we then come to the question of what does the finding entail?</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.179" offset="6528084">We think that basically, the public interest must encompass the basic economic policy of the United States, namely the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.352" offset="6580746">And that's what Judge Kirkpatrick found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.019" offset="6587434">He said there's no doubt whatever that in finding this was in the public interest, his language was, if the FCC necessarily decided that the exchange did not involve a violation of the law which declares and implement a basic economic policy of the United States but we go further than that, that would be true if not for Section 313.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.055" offset="6675623">But here, in the very Communications Act as the Solicitor General has pointed out, we find Section 313 which appears at page 5 of the brief of the Government which says that, “All laws of the United States relating to one lawful restraints, monopolies, combinations and so on are hereby declared to be applicable to the manufacturer, to the interstate or foreign radio communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.559" offset="6805608">So we have not only the general law that the antitrust laws would be imported into the determination of public interest, but we have a mandate in the Communications Act from Congress to the Federal Communications Commission that when it decides the things in the public interest, it cannot decide so, if that particular transaction which it is approving would violate the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.699" offset="6922219">Now, I take it that in inevitable corollary in answer to some of the questions of Your Honors is that the Federal Communications Commission cannot license an act or a transaction which itself constitutes a violation of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.559" offset="6989615">And if it did, then whether with the Department of Justice or a party in interest who isn't protested, that appeal to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the Court would strike it down as being outside the power of the Federal Communications Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="2710.066" offset="10943613">Well, I leave the question of whether to Washingtonians that would seem to be a desirable change as Commissioner Doerfer says mere sales volume isn't the only consideration.But assuming it were, what could happen?</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.497" offset="10993351">What could happen if the NBC decided that it wanted to acquire another station, it would have to go to the Federal Communications Commission and file an application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.347" offset="11052805">And when it filed its application, if the Department of Justice thought there was anything predatory about its acquisition, it could do there what it could have done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.422" offset="11093034">There isn't anything and what relief by the way does the Department of Justice asked for this so-called conspiracy to get another better station than Washington?</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.934" offset="11147160">They can't have more than five under the Federal Communications Regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.399" offset="11164923">So if they give up -- if they acquire one, they got to give up Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.507" offset="11181432">Now, suppose that happens, what does the Department say?</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.535" offset="11193553">The Department wants the United States District Court in spite of this extensive system that has been setup by the Congress for the regulation and licensing of its industry to issue a decree that before NBC could acquire a station in this other city, it must get the authority of the FCC now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.910" offset="11282996">It must get the authority of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.566" offset="11301595">If it wants to get a station in San Francisco, if it wants to get one in Boston or Detroit, which are the cities involved.Does it go to the FCC?</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.722" offset="11334301">Oh no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.723" offset="11342242">That authority as you said if the Government has its way, it goes to the United States District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.166" offset="11364080">And it says to the United States District Court, “Won't you please approve my acquisition in San Francisco?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.902" offset="11390934">Well, I state to Your Honors with full deference that the statement of the remedy which is sought in the complaint is as much of an indictment as a statement of the complaint itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.319" offset="11432626">This is all part and parcel of what was before the Federal Communications Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.540" offset="11461569">The Federal Communications Commission investigation related to whether there was such an attempt by NBC to better its position in two markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.932" offset="11499081">Whether the Philadelphia acquisition was part of that program and they said, “No, there is no such predatory motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.633" offset="11525935">There is no such predatory practice and we therefore approve the acquisition of the Philadelphia station.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.797" offset="11570552">And under those circumstances, it seems to me if Your Honors please, that not only is the first purpose of the Department of Justice which is to have the United States District Court strike down as invalid what the FCC has advertently approved with no new evidence, no new facts, no new issues, no new anti-trust issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.685" offset="11682147">But it's second objective which is to have this Court see it as a kind of super economic tribunal in place of the FCC could decide whether they shall acquire is even more shocking than the first objective.</text>

            <text syncTime="2991.438" offset="12069073">It says that if a broadcasting company is involved, then the Government can impose an additional penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="3005.364" offset="12124871">It seems to me apparent that the strong arm of the Government should not be permitted to be raised with a view to striking down what another branch of the Government has expressly approved than all the more in this case where it has conceded that they had full notice, full opportunity and that there are no new facts, no new issues, no new consideration of any kind.</text>

            <text syncTime="3047.254" offset="12292368">When the Government invokes the aide of an equity court, as Justice Holmes or Wells said, “It so forth takes the position of a private suitor, is to be bound by the same rules of equity and equitable consideration as the private suitor.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3105.635" offset="12525902">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.875" offset="12570833">I would like to call attention first to the remarks of Senator Dill on page 29 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.619" offset="12613883">Senator Dill had charged of this Federal Communications Act when it was passed and he was asked because of the great interest of the Congress in what effect this might have on the antitrust laws, what kind of a function the Federal Communications Commission would have in regard to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.977" offset="12695280">He was in charge of the bill which is the best kind of legislative history and this is what he said, "There is anything in the bill providing in the case the applicant for a permit is found to be acting in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Law or controls a monopoly that the Commission may pass upon the question.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.287" offset="12780544">Senator Dill replied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.626" offset="12789844">That although the bill provided for denial of a license to anybody proved, “has been convicted under the Sherman Antitrust Law or any other law relating to monopoly."</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.925" offset="12835088">And that relates to conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.866" offset="12846791">It “does not attempt to make the Commission the judge as to whether or not certain conditions constitute a monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.162" offset="12892035">It rather leaves that to the Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.993" offset="12907395">Now, this is a blow to the whole enforcement of the antitrust laws of this country if this proceeding is upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.145" offset="12943966">And it's found that the District Court was right because the whole concept of Congress here is that the Courts should enforce this laws and Senator Dill told the Congress when he was asked that very question about this bill that it wasn't for them to decide this very question that they're trying to tell you was decided in this case against the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.015" offset="13047411">Now, let us turn again in 52 to see what the legislative history was on page 31 in the footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.400" offset="13092968">And it's a rather long footnote and I commend it all to you, but I want to call attention to the portion beginning more over about the second full -- the second sentence of the third sentence or the second full -- the first full paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.541" offset="13157543">“Moreover, such an argument is particularly pertinent in connection with alleged violation to the antitrust statutes which are the particular problems of the Department of Justice and do not, by any other law, come within the jurisdiction of any independent quasi-judicial agency of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.267" offset="13240404">So that the emphasis throughout is placed upon the fact that 313 preserves the antitrust enforcement through the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.444" offset="13281155">Now, this conspiracy, we don't say the conspiracy occurred when the Commission ruled on this license or this application for transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.666" offset="13318040">The conspiracy occurred when they made their agreement to use the power of their network to try to make Westinghouse give the station up, that's when it occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.968" offset="13367254">And we say that it was broader than this one transaction, they decided to get two stations away from somebody else and they certainly have the right to use their network affiliation to contract with the station, we don't question that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.629" offset="13421902">But they had no right to abuse it and use it to force somebody else to give up the station that they have by reason of the power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.053" offset="13455548">And when they could take and threaten Westinghouse with laws of not only Philadelphia, but Boston and -- and not getting one at Pittsburgh.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.930" offset="13499120">You can see what it would mean to any little operator that only had one station and his very economic existence will depend upon.</text>

            <text syncTime="3379.496" offset="13621373">I -- I would say that the action of the Commission is a action under the statute which is based upon the public interest and the statutory concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.206" offset="13680201">And if there was any action where there was a conspiracy or a contract in restraint of trade that would be the basis and not the licensing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.792" offset="13726490">And I -- I take the position that the Government had the right, properly to ask for divestiture here and also ask a court to restrain these people from carrying out the rest of their conspiracy, not that they couldn't go and get a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.269" offset="13800469">If the Court said under antitrust principles, that they could go ahead, but the conspiracy was not being continued and that this was part of the fruits of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3475.812" offset="14006627">That was the whole philosophy that they were going to acquire not only one, but two and they were going to use the power of their network to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.803" offset="14038601">That's the allegations of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.982" offset="14047274">Now, I'd like to make it plain here, that what they're seeking is immunity from the antitrust laws and there's no place in this country that anything so important, to the free enterprise of this country and competition should ever be lost except by the act of Congress when they should declare that whether or not there should be immunity and Congress has them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.068" offset="14151659">In the Maritime case, this Court has given great thought and consideration to it and there, there's an expressed provision that if the act isn't unlawful as Judge Branson said, the Maritime Commission can give that immunity but they can't go out and give it if the Congress didn't say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.357" offset="14224802">And the Congress didn't say so in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.045" offset="14235564">And the same is true in the ICC cases where the consolidation, the McLean case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.981" offset="14263254">It specifically provided and that's why the Government came into those cases that Justice Stewart was asking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.190" offset="14288123">The Maritime cases and the ICC case about consolidation, the Government came in because they lose their right for the people if they don't win and protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.752" offset="14330337">But in this situation, we don't believe they lose those rights because the Congress has said, “These rights with the public interest must be protected in the courts of this country.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3601.768" offset="14510477">And the same thing is examined in great deal by this Court in the Maritime cases, in the Far East, in Branson and in Cunard in which the -- this Court went in to the fact that the whole concept was a limitation upon competition that Congress had provided for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.258" offset="14580381">But here, they're trying to impose and get an immunity that Congress expressly provided against time after time in this legislative history and it's the destruction of the antitrust laws and the protection, one of the finest and the most imperative things to preserve in free enterprise in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.410" offset="14677034">And I suggest to you that the -- the Court of Appeals or the district examined this question in Mansfield -- Mansfield case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3662.208" offset="14752162">That there was not -- that the Commissions' function was not to decide the antitrust matter as a matter of violation of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.798" offset="14806601">And they said so in so many words, because its function was to decide the public interest, convenience, and necessity and the antitrust feature was for the Court.</text>
