            <text syncTime="256.767" offset="1130454">That's right Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.689" offset="1150098">The basic question on the immunity point here is whether Section 305 (d), which appears at page 33 of petitioner's brief, extends the immunity of Section 46 of the original Interstate Commerce Act to investigations before the – before a grand jury investigating violations or offenses under Section 322 of the Motor Carriers Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.993" offset="1295339">Section 305 (d), it has two clauses and the – at the beginning of the section, it says that, “So far as maybe necessary for the purposes of this chapter” and then it goes on to say that, “The Commission and the members and the examiners in the joint boards shall have the powers to subpoena witnesses to require the production of documents and to take testimony by a deposition relating to any matter under investigation as the Commission has in the matter arising under Chapter 1 of this title.”</text>
            <text syncTime="343.909" offset="1479032">This first clause was separated from the second clause by a semicolon and it goes on to say, “And any person subpoenaed or testifying in connection with any matter under investigation, under this chapter, shall have the same rights, privileges and immunities and be subject to the same duties, liabilities and penalties as though such matter arose under Chapter 1 of this title, unless otherwise provided in this chapter.”</text>
            <text syncTime="377.856" offset="1614764">It is it is our contention that before an immunity statute can be deemed to extend to a particular tribunal, authorization must be found in the statute for that body to give immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.138" offset="1699924">In Section 46, which also appears at page 33, it is the language in any cause or proceeding, criminal or otherwise, which this Court in Hale versus Henkel sufficed to extend the immunity power to the grand jury, because it was there held that the -- a grand jury inquiry was equivalent to a criminal case or the same as in the criminal case and that Congress, by the use of this language, extended the immunity power to grand juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.463" offset="1845269">The question here is whether the language of incorporation in 305 (d) took into that section the language “or in any cause or proceeding, criminal or otherwise.”</text>
            <text syncTime="452.092" offset="1911724">It is our position that the Congress here was dealing with the power of Congress and that -- power of the Commission and that it was dealing with its powers to take testimony to require the -- the appearance of witness and -- witnesses and the production of papers and documents and that it was not concerned with the power of the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.505" offset="2009422">Congress need not or did not have to give the grand jury power to investigate because the grand jury, I believe, would have the inherent power to investigate the possible violations under the Motor Carriers Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1705.483" offset="6925354">The Rule 42, both (a) and (b) appear at page 37 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.145" offset="6967986">The Court of Appeals took the position that the position that the proceedings in the court on April 8 were ancillary to the grand jury investigation and that the judge was merely being advised as to what transpired in the grand jury room and insofar as the petitioner being compelled to take the stand in the courtroom, Judge Lumbard said, “It made no difference” and Brown remained mute, page 62 of the record and refused to speak at all, the result that would have been the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.418" offset="7177070">In other words, the Court of Appeals considered that the petitioner was convicted of criminal contempt for refusing to answer the questions before the grand jury and this is evident from his statement and that also at page 53, the very -- the very beginning of his opinion, page 53 of the record, “The Government now, however -- however, now takes the position that if petitioner were to be convicted for what went on in the grand jury room after he has been directed to return there and answer, that there would have had to be a proceeding under Rule 42 (b), that is there would have to be notice, specification of charges and the description of the nature of the criminal contempt and an opportunity to prepare and defend -- and the right to bail and so forth, that's provided in Section 42 (b).”</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.355" offset="7428786">The Government, however, still seeks to sustain this conviction under Rule 42 (a) and it therefore reverts to the theory of the District Court that this was a continuance of a grand jury proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.962" offset="7499212">That is now -- we now have in the Southern District, a judge grand jury tribunal and although you have the judge there, you have the clerk of the court and all the requirements of Section -- Rule 6 of the Criminal Procedure are violated to have a valid grand jury proceeding continuing before the court and that the petitioner could have been compelled before the court to answer these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.997" offset="7615404">And that for his refusing to answer these questions before the court and the grand jury is judged grand jury tribunal, he is to be held in contempt under Rule 42 (a) of Criminal Procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="2719.885" offset="10982902">After that, the Court says, “By reason of your refusal to answer in the actual presence of the court, I'm forced to act upon the matter and I will hear from counsel” and he heard from counsel again and then he sentenced him for contempt in the presence of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.560" offset="11073599">On this question of construction as to whether Congress intended the immunity provision of the Motor Carrier Act, to apply to proceedings before a grand jury, it would be strange indeed, if Congress did not so intend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.663" offset="11154056">A great deal of the history of the immunity provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act and indeed that's the history of the immunity provisions in our -- in our jurisprudence, actually occurred before grand juries, rather than in administrative proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.791" offset="11230542">Counselman against Hitchcock, Brown against Walker, Hale against Henkel, all of these cases are landmark cases in this immunity provision with grand jury proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.284" offset="11292505">And I -- I say this then, that it would be -- it would be a strange thing in view of this history, if Congress in making applicable to the Motor Carrier Act, these same provisions which had previously been construed by this Court in connection with the railroads could suddenly have withdrawn the protection and made it apply only in case of commission proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="2822.915" offset="11395009">Indeed, there was powerful argument by some of the ablest lawyers of the day that to require testimony before the Commission makes the court an adjunct of an administrative agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="2837.528" offset="11453524">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.255" offset="11456345">Yes, indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.847" offset="11462719">There's another -- another feature too and that is not only do we have the prior history with respect to the Interstate Commerce Act, but we have the subsequent history because in 1940 and again in 1942, Congress passed additional provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act applying it first to motor carriers and second to freight forwarders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.804" offset="11558640">In both of these cases, they again incorporated the application of the Section 46, the immunity provision applying the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.434" offset="11601063">And in this -- these cases, there's never been any question that it applies to grand juries, as well as to administrative proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.674" offset="11634082">And so I say that it's a -- it would be a strange thing if Congress had carved out this particular section of the Act and made only the administrative proceedings subject to the immunity provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.537" offset="11685491">Certainly, it doesn't appear from the language of this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.629" offset="11697925">The language of this section is, “Any person subpoenaed or testifying in connection with any matter under investigation shall have the same immunities as those any matter arose under Chapter 1 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.187" offset="11768142">The -- the only reason -- the only reason that it can be implied if this is limited is because it is connected in the same section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.458" offset="11801161">Indeed, it's in the same sentence with this provision with respect to the power of the Commission to conduct investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.118" offset="11855809">And petitioner would have us believe that since the first part of this section deals solely with -- with commission investigations, the second part must to do so also.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.194" offset="11908159">Well, the truth of the matter is the first part of this section deals with investigations by the Commission because it's necessary to give that power specifically to the Commission in connection with motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.590" offset="11949746">It wouldn't have it, unless it give -- gave it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.901" offset="11958941">So, it incorporated by reference Section 12 of the -- of the Interstate Commerce Act, but section -- the second part of the section is not necessarily of -- if there's no reason why it should be limited to the -- to the investigative proceedings only and Congress in nowise implied that it should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.873" offset="12050892">I can think of only one possible excuse for construing this section in the limited way that petitioner suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.024" offset="12091434">And that is on the mistaken thought that this is a criminal statute since there can be a possibility of construing it, one of two ways, we must construe it in a way which will give protection to a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.958" offset="12159248">And that's a -- that's a valid argument in connection with criminal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.384" offset="12176906">But I would point out that this particular statute is not a statute establishing a crime, defining a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.573" offset="12201671">It's a statute defining immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.192" offset="12212120">And this question of interpretation might well come before the court in a different context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.925" offset="12231032">It might come up in the case of a criminal prosecution against an individual who claimed that he had obtained immunity on the ground that he had testified before a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.079" offset="12279724">And in that case, it's perfectly apparent that it would be to the advantage of that defendant, if we construed the statute so that he was given immunity on the basis of his -- of his testimony before a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.682" offset="12334059">Yet the question of construction is the same and it is perfectly apparent that there is no really strict interpretation, it's a question of rather determining what Congress had in mind in enacting this particular provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.044" offset="12391528">It seems fair to us, at least, that Congress intended to adopt the immunity provisions which it had found satisfactory from the comparable provisions of dealing with railroads and in the way which this Court has construed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.637" offset="12457880">Now, the -- the second question of construction deals with whether or not, the immunity granted by this section is sufficient so as to make it unnecessary, make it impossible for the petitioner to claim his privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.119" offset="12563832">This too seems to be concluded by prior decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.369" offset="12588805">What was -- the immunity which is given in this case, is the very immunity which was passed upon by this Court in Brown against Walker in dealing with the immunity granted to individuals testifying with respect to the first portion of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.368" offset="12656828">And in Brown against Walker, this Court, after very careful consideration, found that the immunity was coextensive with the liability and as -- as recently as in 1955, this Court has reaffirmed that -- that position in Ullman against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.246" offset="12748361">Petitioner's argument is that the immunity is not complete because of the fact that the section begins with the words, “So far as maybe necessary for the purposes of this chapter.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.990" offset="12823280">These words, however, in that context, clearly state -- clearly mean the circumstances under which the Commission may conduct investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.129" offset="12871868">The Commission itself may conduct administrative proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.172" offset="12888064">If the petitioner is right that these words must be read for the entire section, this is really no more than a repetition of his first argument that we're dealing only with -- with Commission -- with proceedings before the Commission and therefore, we don't need to reach this argument here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.873" offset="12970820">He's proved his -- he's proved his first case that -- that it applies -- that does not apply to grand jury proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.956" offset="13003212">Therefore, this really adds nothing to his prior argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.988" offset="13043336">Now, with respect to procedure, the petitioner has raised three questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.409" offset="13073011">The first question is whether it was proper for this Court to proceed under Rule 42 (a) of the Rules for Criminal Procedure, for a contempt committed in the presence of the Court rather than to proceed on notice under Section 42 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.076" offset="13143646">And the second question on procedure was -- is whether the petitioner was unlawfully required to testify against himself when he was put on the stand and ask questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.913" offset="13195055">And his third question is whether he was deprived the due process by reason of the court's action in the clearing the court at the commencement of the proceeding and not thereafter, inviting the public back in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.646" offset="13257958">But with that, it attacked first the question of whether this procedure was proper under Section -- under Rule 42 (a) of the Rules for Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.012" offset="13299440">Rule 42 (a) provides that when a contempt is committed in the very presence, in the sight of the -- of the court, the court may act summarily in dealing with that contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.306" offset="13356596">Section 22 (b) deals with the situations where a contempt occurs outside of the presence of the court and it's necessary for the court to learn from some other source what went on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.157" offset="13416051">In this particular situation, I think it is true that there was contempt of court, when the petitioner refused in the grand jury room to answer questions which the court had ordered him to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.918" offset="13487000">And I think that that was a contempt which was out of the presence of the court and that one could have proceeded therefore, under Section 42 (b) on notice and would have had to, if you had proceeded on that contempt.</text>
