            <text syncTime="24.562" offset="201644">I'm here on behalf of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.132" offset="215855">We protested the proposed diversion of Great Lakes' water by the Elmhurst-Villa Park-Lombard Water Commission because as we stated in our letter which is attached to the complaint, the diversion added the Great Lakes and the Basin and into another watershed would constitute an infringement of the rights of Pennsylvania as a riparian sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.493" offset="309373">The lowering of the levels of Lake Erie constitutes immeasurable damage to Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.797" offset="334555">But beyond this very real question of damages Pennsylvania is concerned with the theory of law upon which this proposed diversion is predicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.863" offset="374784">A theory of far reaching implications, we believe startling and without precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.441" offset="401115">And Mr. Justice Brennan observed yesterday, if this corporation is entitled to take and divert Great Lakes Water then a precedent is established for innumerable users and commercial suppliers of water in the United States and Canada to divert without control or limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.454" offset="481155">The complaint seeks to restrain the defendant state but it places no limitation on the plaintiffs.</text>

            <text syncTime="184.661" offset="842062">But we would like to call the Court's attention to a letter of April 9th, 1959 from the Canadian embassy to the United States and if I may I would quote this just as one sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.921" offset="899009">Every diversion of water within Great Lakes watershed at Chicago inevitably decreases the volume of water remaining in the basin for all purposes.</text>

            <label>Ms. Lois G. Forer</label>
            <text syncTime="222.448" offset="993155">This -- I am reading from the House of Commons Debate, Volume 103, Number 59, the Second Session, 24th Parliament, Official Report dated Thursday April 16th, 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.610" offset="1085837">In cases such as this involving natural resources, one who objects to a taking or a wasting of a resource is always placed in a dilemma articulated in the Old English Chancery case of Goldsmith against Tunbridge Wells Improvement Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.271" offset="1156472">Either, we are accused object -- objecting too early or because the taking or wasting is of a small amount or waiting too late until we are faced with a (Inaudible) plea, as we were in the Chicago Sanitary District case which, of course, you are all very familiar.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.620" offset="1233899">The applicable law to this taking as we view it is well settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.087" offset="1255737">All of the Great Lakes States including Illinois and also Canada adhere to the riparian doctrine of water law.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.985" offset="1291264">This Commission is an Illinois corporation authorized to sell water to communities and industries, and there are plans for further expansion of the industries in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.138" offset="1347897">It is undisputed that these are none riparian users and indeed are outside of the Great Lakes Watershed.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.367" offset="1380812">Whether they are 20 miles from the Great Lakes or 200 miles is in our opinion wholly irrelevant because if the State of Illinois can come in and claim that a non-riparian has a right to take and divert, then they make their claim with respect to any community within the entire state.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.188" offset="1464090">Thus we say any analogy to what is being done in Milwaukee, Cleveland, and Chicago which are riparian municipalities entitled to use Great Lakes Water is implicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.598" offset="1517798">All of the riparian communities along the Great Lakes with which are familiar use that water and return it to the basin in accordance with riparian law of reasonable use, all except Chicago of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.569" offset="1577671">This corporation, the Elmhurst-Villa Park-Lombard Commission asserts a unilateral right as a non-riparian outside the watershed to take an unlimited quantity of interstate and international waters without regulation by any governmental agency and without the consent of the riparian sovereigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.009" offset="1667427">While Illinois asserts that the amount of water to be taken is relatively small, the complaint itself seeks an unlimited right to take without any interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.739" offset="1710373">In seeking to negotiate with Illinois, the thrust of the defendant states has been to require a return of the effluent which would constitute about 93% of the water taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.894" offset="1766902">But while seeking such a return of that purified effluent will substantially reduce the damages, the right to take water at all is hereby challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.316" offset="1816639">The plaintiff's justification for taking, as alleged in paragraph 3 of the complaint is the urgent need of these communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.675" offset="1854046">Mr. Bane in his argument adverted at some length to the engineering studies upon which the plan for this taking was based and this study is mentioned in paragraph 9 of the complaint although of course it is not in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.635" offset="1917889">But like the affidavits, I attached to the motion to advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.372" offset="1936906">This engineering study does not bear scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.559" offset="1953625">It sets forth exports two reasons for the plan on page 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.320" offset="1972642">One is that the use of lake water instead of well water which save each household $16 a year for soap.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.669" offset="2018095">Mr. Justice Brennan asked why these communities did not choose to purchase water from the sanitary district.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.804" offset="2050591">And in answering that question, Mr. Bane again referred to the engineering report and stated that this was the recommendation of the engineers and of course this is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.559" offset="2093641">But the reason for this recommendation is very interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.578" offset="2109733">If I may, I would like to read just one sentence there, one paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.917" offset="2131048">Two practical methods of obtaining Lake Michigan water are available to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.196" offset="2156126">They are: one, negotiation for purchase of filtered water from the City of Chicago, or two, construction and operation of new supply and treatment facilities to be owned and operated by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.423" offset="2217044">A course analysis of the alternate methods indicates that the estimated unit course for filtered Lake Michigan water will be less if the Commission builds and operates its own independent system.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.483" offset="2281305">This is the need of which has been asserted.</text>

            <text syncTime="550.758" offset="2306382">Mrs. Forer, would you have any objection if they did buy their water from the sanitary district?</text>

            <text syncTime="557.916" offset="2335013">Well, our objection might be different.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.607" offset="2349850">We say that the sanitary district is a riparian authority which has the right and power to use Lake Michigan water.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.217" offset="2408260">Since the taking of water by the sanitary district is subject to the opening decree of this Court we feel that we as defendant states would not be harmed by any additional servicing of other communities since any diversion of the water would be subject to the control of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.416" offset="2508988">And therefore we say that any taking additional taking must of course be considered in original cases two, three, and four before this Court to determine to what extent any diversion at all out of the lakes is permissible and to what extent it damages all of us as defendant states.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.565" offset="2605641">This would not involve a new principle of law that a non-riparian community could simply purchase one -- my new portion of land along the lake and put in a pumping station and divert waters down the State uninterruptedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.364" offset="2676799">If the Metropolitan sanitary district does it, we say it is subject to the control of this Court entirely.</text>

            <text syncTime="684.966" offset="2843251">This water commission, this corporation is established to sell water to pump and supply and sell water.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.884" offset="2882957">It has no authority according to Illinois to purify the sewage and to return it.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.601" offset="2913782">The plan of this corporation is to take the water from the Great Lakes, take it over the watershed, service these communities and industries at a profit or a certainly charging for it, and then simply let gravity and nature take its scores and the water will be -- go down the Mississippi Waterway.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.302" offset="3008554">Now, I'd like to point out that we have heard at great length that only a small amount of water is involved.Under the decree of this Court, the sanitary district is taking 1500 cubic feet per second for the purpose of flushing out the canal.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.489" offset="3077308">In addition, they are taking an unlimited quantity as domestic pumpage.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.922" offset="3099042">And according to the figures of the sanitary district this is some 1700 cubic feet per second.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.206" offset="3128195">Totalled together, this constitutes more water then flows through the Delaware River, so we are not talking about small amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.753" offset="3170408">And as I say, if this amount of water is added, every other community may also add and we see it is a very serious question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2334.154" offset="9440005">We have carefully examined Original 15 and we believe that this Court has jurisdiction that the complaint should be allowed to be filed, that the case should be considered along with two, three and four together so that the whole problem could be properly resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.044" offset="9527568">But there is no question of what this Court has the power to enter a declaratory judgment as in the original action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.747" offset="9562363">And we think the decisions we have cited in our brief well support that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.432" offset="9589112">The basic problem in this case involves the rights of the riparian.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.750" offset="9618369">We think there is no question to what the State of Illinois properly represents these communities as water users within the State in this litigation and that any decree this Court would enter would bind the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.237" offset="9700289">And if they want to divert water from the Lake of Michigan, and this Court would say they would have to return the effluent to that lake as a condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.298" offset="9720560">The State of Illinois would have to abide by that condition and every water user within the State that was -- and that the State was acting on behalf of and it would bind it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.185" offset="9764133">And these, the decisions of this Court make that very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.286" offset="9776567">In fact this Court has acted in the past to say that water users themselves were not proper parties in the litigation of this character.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.657" offset="9813974">And that the States as quasi sovereigns would properly before in trying to resolve the interest of their water users.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.266" offset="9848456">The problem we have is the question of the diversion of water out of the watershed by riparian interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.524" offset="9889520">And the basic theory of riparian water has always been if you take water out and you put it back less the consumptive use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.383" offset="9936854">And therefore the common interest in the use of that pool of water is injured only to the extent of the actual consumptive use and no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.471" offset="9989308">Now this problem presents the question of diverting it out of the watershed and not returning it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.940" offset="10019088">This Court has approved that type of action in two different matters involving riparian waters or waters where the riparian doctrines were recognized by the laws of the States that were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.066" offset="10079587">One was the case of the City of Boston where it was clearly taken out of the watershed, several rivers, and devoted to the use of the City of Boston because of its needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.749" offset="10126399">The other one was the City of New York, New Jersey against New York, where a similar provision was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.693" offset="10154193">And we think that the decisions of this Court have made it very clear that the principle equitable apportionment governs in these conflicts or disputes between States involving matters of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.463" offset="10221275">The Court throughout the -- its history in the consideration of the litigation between States has said that it is not going to be bound by special rules of law that it is just going to devote itself to resolving those problems by the law of what is fair, just, and equitable between these great sovereigns that make up these United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.453" offset="10333184">And that is the consideration that we think the Court must turn to in resolving this particular question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.616" offset="10365785">If the needs are found upon proper trial to be such that this community for its life has to have this water, and it can be fairly and just to be done under equitable principles, then we think this Court has the power to say that it can be diverted even out of the watershed and it will not return to the lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.935" offset="10467140">That is a problem that will have to be resolved in the case upon a hearing, but it's not involved in our opinion in this question of whether the complaint is properly filed or should be allowed to be filed at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.092" offset="10531715">Now, I don't want to argue 2, 3 and 4 before you, but I think I need to touch upon it briefly in order to show you how it's related.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.957" offset="10571212">The Court -- the Court, Members of Court have asked questions about whether or not this problem could be solved by allowing Chicago to furnish the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.791" offset="10622516">The United States does not think that solves the problem because this is out of the watershed and there isn't as we read the decree of this Court in Wisconsin against Illinois, there is not anything involving the supplying of water as domestic pumpage to cities or communities outside of the watershed to be -- and diverted for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.070" offset="10743620">So that it appears to us that the decree in those cases contemplates domestic pumpage entirely as water that would be used within the watershed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.013" offset="10799417">Now, it does provide for diversion of the water after use outside of the watershed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.519" offset="10829406">And that's why I think I need to deal very briefly with the -- what the Court decided in the earlier decree in Wisconsin against Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.670" offset="10870053">The Court will recall there were two different decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.648" offset="10881964">One was by Chief Justice Taft and the later one by Justice Holmes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.063" offset="10907669">And the basic principle that was involved was that the City of Chicago over a term of years had been engaged in withdrawing or diverting large amounts of water from Lake Michigan down through the complex of the Chicago Ship Canal and Des Planes River into the Illinois River.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.609" offset="11017801">And it was a question of what authority legally there could be for such a diversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.165" offset="11044028">On the first opinion the Court recognized that the diversion was basically made because Chicago did not have a proper sewage system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.007" offset="11083421">And instead of providing such as system it just proceeded to dump all its sewage right down this Chicago Ship Canal and leave it as a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.211" offset="11128247">And it got so bad that something had to be used to flash it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.793" offset="11146533">And so they wanted to use the water from the lake in very large quantities as much as 8500 cubic feet per second to flash out this canal that was serving as a sewage disposal for the City of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.501" offset="11221347">The Court appointed the Master and the Master reported that Chicago must have some kind of adequate sewage disposal system but there is no properly legal grounds for using this water in that manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.025" offset="11283519">And that the only real basis would be for the purposes of navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.488" offset="11313298">Then the matter was considered later and the final decree was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.959" offset="11343182">And you recall that first provided for a use of 6500 cubic feet per second.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.633" offset="11369932">And in 1935 that was to be reduced to 5000 cubic feet per second and then it was later to be reduced to 1500 cubic feet per second.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.103" offset="11407757">And that is what is being -- is allowed now under the decree and there were these certain reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.869" offset="11434820">Now, the Court didn't find that there was any legal grounds under water law for the use of that amount of water for this sanitary condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.277" offset="11484453">And they didn't find that it was necessary to have all of that water for purposes of navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.117" offset="11511829">But the Court did find that under equitable principles the conditions were so bad in this situation, had grown so bad, that something had to be done about it and that Court under equity did not have to injure or destroy this community but could provide for the correction of the situation as rapidly as it could be achieved under any reasonable prospects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.041" offset="11639515">So that was the scheme that was provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.115" offset="11651845">And it was -- as we see it, not contemplated, that the City of Chicago would have the right to use as domestic pumpage of more than what was described in the decree as the water that it would pump through its mains, and within -- probably for the communities that Chicago then had and its reasonable developments as a part of Chicago.</text>

            <text syncTime="2934.626" offset="11841912">I can't say from that decree whether the Court ever contemplated that that kind of sales would be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.937" offset="11867094">The Court carefully described in paragraph 3 of the decree that it would be such water as was pumped through the mains of the City of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.634" offset="11913906">And I think in order to interpret that properly you have to back to the situation at that time and see what was being done in the Chicago area in handling the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.561" offset="11957582">And I think that could be established in -- by proper proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.332" offset="11972733">But I don't see any sign that anybody contemplated at that time that the water would be used outside of the watershed of the Lake Michigan as far as the use was concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.931" offset="12027068">Now, it was that -- it was contemplated to be diverted by -- after it passed through the sanitary system and then go down the Illinois River.</text>

            <text syncTime="3002.555" offset="12113586">We then get down to the problem after examining those decisions of the Court in 2, 3 and 4 of what was contemplated by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.372" offset="12160815">The Court provided the 1500 cubic feet per second for this function of taking care of navigation and flashing out whatever is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.484" offset="12209298">And then in -- on the top of that, it provided the domestic pumpage that Chicago would require.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.142" offset="12243989">Well that is a figure of about 1700 and that would be added on to the 1500 cubic feet per second that's specifically provided for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.787" offset="12282546">The difficulty that the United States has had in 2, 3 and 4 particularly and we think it has a bearing directly upon 15 here is that we now have in the record, the information that was given us and we have tendered to the Court in our brief in 2, 3 and 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.744" offset="12362376">The statement of the Corps of Engineers that all that is required for navigational purposes in the Illinois River in the canal is 1500 cubic feet per second.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.450" offset="12417128">So, with the domestic pumpage being over 1700 cubic feet per second, that domestic pumpage itself would take all -- take care of all the navigational requirements of this canal and the Illinois River without water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.283" offset="12500511">Now, the claims made that because of the pollution that's involved, because Chicago was not able to produce more than 95% purity with its treatment of the sewage that there is still a need for this additional water to produce -- to provide additional oxygen so that they can handle and take care of the needs of this canal and Illinois River because if the stream is -- if that is too greatly polluted, it can't be used properly for navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.979" offset="12663306">Now, the difficulty we have with that is that in the decisions of the Court both the first and second, it seems very clear to us that the Court contemplated that there would be a complete treatment of sewage by Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.576" offset="12733628">That the Court provided a detailed plan for the sewage treatment and that plan contemplated that they would use this facility to treat all of the sewage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.280" offset="12788485">Now, it was never -- I want to make it clear, it was never contemplated that the treatment would be perfect that it would be 100%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.065" offset="12815653">It was contemplated that that treatment would be satisfactory to extent of 85% to 95% and they have come within that range.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.643" offset="12849925">In fact there is good showing that was made to me that they might really obtain the 95% they had recently because of some changes in their plant and additions and improvements that made it less satisfactory at the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.280" offset="12916485">But there's a good prospect they might obtain 95%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.498" offset="12933413">But there is also clear indication that there is a substantial portion as much as 3% annually of the sewage that they don't try to create at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.350" offset="12988792">They just open the gates and let it run down the river in the canal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.893" offset="13010944">And consequently they have a condition of pollution by reason of that that would not occur at all if they would treat the sewage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.976" offset="13055248">Now, it isn't a simple problem and that's why we suggest that it would be in the interest of these cases and the handling of this whole matter in this proper disposition to have a special master.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.042" offset="13111568">Because they say if we treat all the sewage and just -- don't just open up the gates when the flood times and let run down the canal, so we have all these raw sewage and pollution there, then we've got to have sewage plants that will be so large to take care of the flood waters that is entirely impractical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.664" offset="13194010">On the other side, there is the contention that that isn't necessary that there are all kinds of reservoirs and receptacles that can be developed under proper methods of engineering known to sanitary engineers at this time whereby you hold this material, the sewage in these reservoirs and properly taken care of until you can process and through your sewage plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.222" offset="13296306">And then you don't throw all these raw sewage in and just ask these other bordering lake states to furnish the water to take care of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.103" offset="13331832">Now, the basic problem it seems to me deals in the area of equity and fairness between these states board -- bordering found the Great Lakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.520" offset="13373419">And that is if the city -- first, we have to start that the legitimate needs of the City of Chicago, one of the great cities of this country must be taken care of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.544" offset="13421589">And I think there is no difficulty between the States in agreeing to that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.931" offset="13443114">But secondly that what ours of legitimate means?</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.588" offset="13457742">Can it call upon the other states to accept or take upon themselves burdens that within reasonable limits are not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.332" offset="13500688">And I think that's the second part that has to be worked out and it would be best worked out by a special master in examination of the whole problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="3389.455" offset="13661184">And therefore, they would not all the water they say they now in need to go in to canal because of the impurities they put in it themselves unnecessarily.</text>

            <text syncTime="4419.773" offset="17782471">Now, in the 1930 decree, if Your Honors please, this Court recognized the right of Illinois to take water for domestic pumpage without any odd measurement by the terms of that decree in cubic feet per second or gallons per second.</text>

            <text syncTime="4665.524" offset="18765511">It can't affect tonnage by a fraction of an ounce nothing that can be measured.</text>
            <text syncTime="4675.450" offset="18805217">Now, practically however, there is a great difference between buying water from Chicago and obtaining it in the manner that is contemplated by these communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4690.614" offset="18865821">And one has only to have a general knowledge of Chicago and its environs to realize that for water to be taken through Chicago we'd have to tear up some of the most miles and miles and miles of the most highly developed, valuable real estate in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="4713.500" offset="18957354">The -- the consideration is impaired impractical whereas the solution that we propose is immanently feasible.</text>
            <text syncTime="4725.862" offset="19006777">Much has been said about who is a riparian proprietor but there has been some suggestion that the periphery of the concept of the riparian interest depends on the contours of the watershed.</text>

            <text syncTime="4848.699" offset="19498193">We say that it is not feasible, not practical, will do no good or be of no -- no particular help, the amount involved is that -- it can't be measured and the expenses enormous and that is our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4869.730" offset="19582307">However, we are most insistent on our right to take the water and use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4877.594" offset="19613759">We don't think that we have to return it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4880.326" offset="19624626">Some of the suggestions here is that we don't even have a right to take it because we're not riparian.</text>
            <text syncTime="4886.060" offset="19647613">That, Your Honors means, that these communities have to wither and perish.</text>
            <text syncTime="4891.824" offset="19670706">And we can't believe that anything in the jurisprudence that should govern sovereign states in their relation requires any such result of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4900.522" offset="19705501">Thank you Your Honor.</text>
