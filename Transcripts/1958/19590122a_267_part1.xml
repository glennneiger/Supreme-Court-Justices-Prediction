            <text syncTime="32.317" offset="232678">This matter is before the Court on a writ of certiorari issues to review the decision of the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.638" offset="277922">The action started as a simple suit to recover the purchase price for the quantity of onions claimed to have been sold by the respondent in these proceedings here -- to the petitioner in these proceedings here.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.713" offset="354200">It was a brief complaint in which it was simply alleged that there was a sale of a quantity of onions by Kosuga to Kelly for a stipulated price.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.798" offset="410520">The complaint alleged that in breach of the contract, Kelly had refused to accept delivery of a portion of this quantity of onions and that there remained due and owing to Kosuga a substantial sum of money on account of that -- that transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.030" offset="495470">The answer filed by the defendant below, Mr. Kelly, denied that this was a simple transaction alleged by the plaintiff in his complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.821" offset="550640">The defendant alleged in -- as an affirmative allegation in his answer and further as an affirmative defense that the cause of acton alleged by the plaintiff was but an integral part of a much broader understanding and agreement between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.650" offset="657951">The defendant alleged that the crew undertaking between the parties encompass an agreement whereby Mr. Kosuga, together with his associate, a Mr. Siegel and along with Kelly and a group of persons similarly situated with Kelly, entered into an agreement, a combination and a conspiracy to affect, regulate, modify and influence, manipulate the price of onions on both the cash and the futures markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.325" offset="852720">And the defendant below, Mr. Kelly, further alleged in his affirmative defense to the action, that the incidental purchase by him of 50 carloads of onions from Kosuga was but an integral part of an overall agreement by which those similarly situated with Kelly were to purchase altogether the sum of 287 carloads of onions for the avowed and express purpose of removing not only that quantity of onions but a still larger quantity of onions owned by Kosuga and his associate from the market in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.774" offset="1070477">And that it was by this device that it was contemplated that they would effect a manipulation of the market price of onions.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.055" offset="1119587">Kelly specifically further alleged that in consideration of the entire understanding between all of these parties, none of them, whether the buyers or the sellers would deliver any portion of the onions concerning which the entire contract related on either the cash or the futures market.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.637" offset="1241945">Now, upon filing that affirmative defense, the plaintiff below moved to strike it from the grounds that it did not constitute an answer to the allegations of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.235" offset="1300355">And this, notwithstanding, it was spelled out in the answer that it was the claim of the defendant Kelly below that in consequence of this entire undertaking, the entire agreement as to a port of -- a portion of which, the plaintiff would rely in bringing this suit was illegal as being contrary to the Sherman Antitrust Act in that it was patently but a device by which to fix prices.</text>

            <text syncTime="524.652" offset="2201997">Now, the District Court held that the remedy afforded by this -- the remedies afforded by the Sherman Act were exclusive of non-collectability of the purchase price of the contract and predicated it's decisions upon that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.958" offset="2291231">The District Court seemingly concluded that the rule of this Court in the Connolly-Sewer Pipe case had either been abrogated -- or strike that, that the rule of the Connolly-Sewer Pipe case was the true rule and that the rule of this Court in the Continental Wall Paper Company case had either been abrogated or modified by the decisions of this Court in the so-called Wilder case and in the so-called Bruce's Juices case.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.502" offset="2457370">Following the action of the District Court in that respect in striking the affirmative answers, a summary judgment was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.246" offset="2508361">On appeal to the Seventh Circuit, that Court, relying upon the same authorities as the District Courts principally, the Connolly-Sewer Pipe case, the Wilder case and Bruce's Juices case, they seemingly concluded that the rule of the Continental Wall Paper case which they recognized was contrary in its result from that reached in the Connolly case was a rule that could be applied only where the members of an antitrust combination were particularly vicious.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.230" offset="2684322">And that unless the combination relied upon by the defendant in seeking avoidance of the obligation was a particularly vicious combination that the rule of the Continental Wall Paper case wouldn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.577" offset="2753703">And it is in substance with this finding and disposition of the cause by the Seventh Circuit with which petitioner here takes exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.594" offset="2809710">This Court granted certiorari on the petitioner's application and representation that the decision of the Seventh Circuit erroneously construed the decisions of this Court in holding that a contract, illegal because of the Sherman Act, could not be defended against by a party thereto upon those grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.525" offset="2913468">It is agreed in this proceeding by the brief filed by the respondent herein that the virtue of the issue is not to be tested by the technicalities or the niceties of the pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.781" offset="2970520">But that squarely presented is the fundamental and the germane issue as to whether or not it is the rule of this Court that in a suit to recover the purchase price of a commodity involved in interstate commerce where the defendant alleges that the very contract upon which the suit is brought to recover that purchase price is violative of the Sherman Act whether such a defense is or is not a good defense or is a defense that can be interposed.</text>
