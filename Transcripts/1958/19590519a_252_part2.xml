            <label>Mr. Samuel M. Lane</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">-- federal supremacy question had not been raised below on the -- it would not be available here.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.684" offset="166118">In their reply brief, the -- appellant suggests that the federal supremacy question is a question of jurisdiction and since jurisdiction can never be waived, then this federal question of supremacy is always available.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.823" offset="238634">I don't think it needs extended argument to indicate that this is not a jurisdictional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.611" offset="261831">This is merely a federal question, the same as all the federal questions presented under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.584" offset="293700">And therefore, not having been raised below, nor preserved here, need not be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.136" offset="331943">Feeling as strongly as I do about that, it doesn't seem to me that I should take much of any of the Court's time on arguing the merits of the federal supremacy question, which is sought to be raised, I think stated in a nutshell, the contention that is made on this ground by the appellant is that since the Federal Government has itself antitrust laws and other laws regulating business practices that the Federal Government has pre-empted the entire field.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.147" offset="480005">If that was so, in the case of the antitrust laws, it occurs to me that the question would have been tested long since in such cases as the Waters-Pierce Oil Company against the Texas in 1909 or more recently in Tigner against Texas or in Parker against Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.200" offset="580211">But the state antitrust laws and the federal antitrust laws have existed side-by-side or I suppose now, nearly 70 years and it's apparent that the state antitrust laws and here, the state sales below cost laws seek the same objectives and supplement one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.136" offset="687940">It seems to me that the -- among the recent cases in this Court, the one that provoked the -- the most -- the sharpest split in this Court was Rice against Santa Fe which had to do, as you will recall, on whether or not, the Warehouse Receipts Act has amended using the word, “exclusive” in the amendment was intended -- supplied all the state acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.177" offset="792116">And there, there was -- you -- I realize a -- a split, but there has been no court -- no decisions cited for the proposition that the Federal Government, through its antitrust laws or through the Robinson-Patman Act, have pre-empted this entire field.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.105" offset="879783">And since, there's nothing like the Interstate Commerce Commission regulation or pure food and drug law or anything of that kind that requires a central and uniform and exclusive administration from a practical point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.525" offset="945507">It seems to me that on the merits, there's nothing to this preemption question either and so I will draft it without more ado.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.478" offset="997334">Now, having disposed of that question, I hoped satisfactorily on the federal supremacy, you might suppose that I would now come to the question of the possible or the alleged violation of the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment that there is still another hurdle over which, I think, this appellant does not get.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.338" offset="1088763">There is a procedural obstacle to the appeal here which it seems to me, should cut off the consideration of any federal question before you arrive at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.261" offset="1144456">The state court -- the trial court, affirmed by the Supreme Court, held that the remedy in such a case is this, was to apply for an injunction and that remedy was speedy, inadequate and complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.503" offset="1233377">And under those circumstances, I think the law is well settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.448" offset="1249155">But since this judgment can rest upon a non-federal adequate basis, then this Court should not go into the federal question which is sought to be raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.886" offset="1302967">If Your Honors would look at pages 636 and 637 of the records, you will find the Supreme Court's discussion of the subject which is very pointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.150" offset="1351973">In considering Unfair Sales Practice Acts from a procedural viewpoint, commentators have observed the wisdom of the legislatures in providing the remedy by injunction and the increasing tendency of the courts to enjoin that the suit of competitors, repeated violations affecting the unfair conduct of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.415" offset="1425011">Availability of the injunction remedy and that of interlocutory decrees based on actions, therefore, precludes the practice endorsed in by many fair-minded competitors immediately to meet competition by resorting to the same practice itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.317" offset="1484675">Since actions for injunctions maybe filed by a trade association for the benefit of all its members, the practice of resorting to the same practices to meet competition is materially reduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.651" offset="1521977">That is the practice of meeting cut by cut in the marketplace is materially reduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.467" offset="1549249">Well the natural restraint against suing a competitor is less present in the seeking of immediate relief against threatened heretical price was.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.879" offset="1578924">And then the Court says specifically, “We are of the opinion that this injunction granted by the trial court against Safeway, was proper because under our statute, the appropriate remedy was by an injunction and not by retaliation or retaliatory action such as was practiced by Safeway."</text>
            <text syncTime="387.390" offset="1652903">In this respect, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.194" offset="1684146">This Court so far as I know in an unbroken line of decisions of which one of the leading is Murdock against Memphis, decided in 1874 and coming on down through Fox Film against Muller, in 1935, has consistently held that where there was in fact, an adequate, independent, non-federal grounds upon which to base the judgment, this Court will not disturb it, because there was a federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.836" offset="1846732">I would suppose that an exception to that would be whether the federal question was a controlling question.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.026" offset="1875466">Or -- but the rule is as I have -- I think, stated it and I take a certain delight in pointing out that in McCoy against Shaw, State Auditor, in 1928, the attorney who prevailed on this very issue was Mr. V. P. Crowe whose name leads all the rest on the appellant's brief in this Court here.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.001" offset="2019349">This then brings me, at last, to the question of the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process and Equal Protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.253" offset="2068355">It seems to us that if a state or reasons, which seem adequate to its legislature determined that there is a -- an economic vise in loss-leader merchandising, it is for that state alone, to decide that question of policy and not for this Court to disturb it.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.082" offset="2187682">The state legislature, of course, in exercising that power must do so in a way which is not arbitrary or -- and -- and when in the enforcement of the statute, it must also enforce it in a way which is not arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.815" offset="2278588">I heard Your Honors speaking this morning about the (Inaudible) case.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.770" offset="2298441">That's the latter situation, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.111" offset="2311816">Now, you take this particular type of legislation, it's not new.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.083" offset="2335744">As a matter of fact, South Carolina had this type of statute as long ago as 1902.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.067" offset="2367613">Most of the current statutes, however, were originated during the hard times of the early 1930s and they all follow a pretty consistent pattern, and they've been tested repeatedly in the highest courts of their respective states that passed those laws, unlike this one, they all forbid sales below cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.685" offset="2474088">Then because it is so difficult, mechanically, I assume or administratively to ascertain what proportion of overhead should rest upon each particular item sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.821" offset="2522676">These statutes have a built-in cost formula which is that cost you can now call it statutory cost, is invoice or replacement cost plus transportation, plus cottage, plus taxes, plus an arbitrary 6%, unless the person accused of violating the Act can prove that in fact his cost was less than 6%.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.023" offset="2627480">And in each of these statutes, it is provided that a competitor can meet -- a competitor, in good faith, can meet the prices of his competitor, but sometimes that is couched a little differently than others.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.177" offset="2720057">It would seem to me that if the State had wished, it could have enacted such a statute saying that it shall be unlawful to sell below cost where the effect alone is to injure competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.256" offset="2796440">But actually, the Supreme Court of Oklahoma felt that it couldn't sustain such a statute because it has criminal penalties, a misdemeanor to violate the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.528" offset="2841475">And so, the Oklahoma Supreme Court required that for a violation of this statute, the sales should be with the intent and purpose of ensuring competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.547" offset="2889540">Other states had held otherwise on that, at least one had and it seems to me too that under Section 2 of the Robinson-Patman Act, there's no requirement for a wrongful intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.184" offset="2948159">Now, my opponent argues vigorously that there's something wrong about this statute because he says, “This statute permits me to -- only to meet the prices of my competitors who are selling at cost.”</text>
            <text syncTime="730.749" offset="3026317">And he says, “Since the statute or a violation requires a wrongful intent, perhaps my competitor would be selling below cost, but with pure motives and therefore, his sale is legal and I can't meet it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="749.830" offset="3102699">Now, answer number one, if the legislature of Oklahoma wanted so to provide whether we think that it's a wise thing or not, I say that they could so provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.163" offset="3168005">Answer number two --</text>

            <text syncTime="808.996" offset="3339368">Let me ask you this, just before you leave that as purely practical question and maybe it's not very relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.280" offset="3364446">I'm curious, how -- how was a -- how is a seller to know what the cost of his competitor is?</text>

            <text syncTime="824.179" offset="3400077">What happens in -- in fact is that you get tremendous buying organizations like the big chains and because of their purchasing power.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.649" offset="3433932">You know that they're buying it -- when they sell at cost, that's probably been arrived, then the other independents who compete with them, form buying associations like IGA.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.716" offset="3486281">And they buy through the association which polices prices, checks them all the time and sends them weekly or one -- perhaps more frequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.584" offset="3521703">I don't know a list of what the prices are at cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.075" offset="3539675">But when you've been in the grocery businesses, these people -- or have been all their lives, they know within reasons when an opponent -- a competitor is selling below cost in violation to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.544" offset="3589517">What they do is they call the secretary of the grocers association and say, “Charlie is going below again.”</text>
            <text syncTime="877.828" offset="3614699">And he calls Charlie out and puts him back in line.</text>

            <text syncTime="886.879" offset="3650853">I think so and that seems to me that the best illustration of that is that they refer to some statutes in existence today.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.116" offset="3679796">And of course, the question that Your Honor raises has been raised many times in the state courts on that very subject and where it has been raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.468" offset="3713233">It's been held that it's within reason and constitutes no such uncertainty as to void the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.971" offset="3743222">The second answer to this is that the question as to whether Safeway can, in good faith, meet the cost -- meet the price of a competitor who is selling below cost in good faith, had never been litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.042" offset="3815528">It wasn't raised here.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.258" offset="3820440">It wasn't considered here.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.159" offset="3827963">It doesn't seem to me that it should be considered in this Court now.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.917" offset="3851055">Surely, when that question arises, it will be up to the State Supreme Court in Oklahoma to come up with the right interpretation of the statute to meet it.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.402" offset="3904972">I say that because Your Honors will search the record in vain to find anything that indicates that any of the prices, which Safeway said it was meeting here, were lawful prices below cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.222" offset="3988250">And this Court has repeatedly held that it will not decide constitutional questions on hypothetical issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.001" offset="4039346">One of the cases which comes to my mind as I -- I speak of this is a case I think it came up from Oklahoma or I'm sorry that I don't recall it.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.606" offset="4093785">But I think it was Oklahoma, a well-known case, Nobel State Bank against Haskell, you will remember that the State enacted a statute which assessed a 1% levy on the average annual deposits of state chartered banks, the Noble State Bank.</text>

            <text syncTime="1719.496" offset="6981360">It rests upon the conclusion of Judge Spellman, the trial court that Safeway knew when it met these prices that they were below cost, because as a large chain, it knew that it could buy at a lower price or as lower price as anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.416" offset="7044995">That does not mean that they knew they were meeting an unlawful price to determine which they would have to know the intent of the person who set the price they were meeting and the ultimate effect in the market of the price that they met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.968" offset="7107271">The other basis, the other predicate for that finding is the alternative pleadings of Safeway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.067" offset="7131617">In the alternative, if we cannot meet these prices, then they are illegal and should be enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.301" offset="7164531">And the Supreme Court clearly shows that in its opinion because it said, "For the sole purpose of meeting the prices of its competitors, Safeway reduced prices to levels which it thought -- going back to Judge Spellman, were below cost."</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.429" offset="7225135">Now, as to the question is this arbitrary, the question that Mr. Justice Black asked and the ultimate question on this issue, is it arbitrary, why should the housewives of Oklahoma and buying baby food be required to pay for trading stamps?</text>

            <text syncTime="1812.087" offset="7351672">This is the very thing, the very thing that Justice Stone was talking about in his descent in Tyson &amp; Brother v. Banton.</text>
