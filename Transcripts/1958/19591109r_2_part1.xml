            <text syncTime="30.558" offset="225573">This case comes before the Court on reargument.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.122" offset="243858">It was argued in February this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.606" offset="257755">In March the Court ordered reargument on specific constitutional issues concerning our contention that there was a violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution pertaining to search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.204" offset="336227">It will be my plan on reargument to briefly review the facts once again for the Court and then advance to my contention that this case involves issues of great importance to United States, not only with respect to important phases of its national security, but also with respect to what I shall contend of violations of fundamental rights and liberties that affect every person living in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.537" offset="509471">To briefly review the facts, this case began in May of 1957, when the man named Reino Hayhanen appeared in the American embassy in Paris and stated to the local representative of the Central Intelligence Agency attached to that embassy that for several years, he had been engaged in espionage in the United States, where he operated under a man known to him only as “Mark”.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.088" offset="651682">He described the man with some particularity.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.804" offset="666624">He produced indeed a hollowed out coin which was recognized by the local attaché as a type that could be used in the transmittal of espionage materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.235" offset="732348">He was brought back to the United States and turned over to the F.B.I., who then proceeded to go to his home in Peekskill, New York, where a great many other objects which would tend to sustain his story, were uncovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.435" offset="805073">Now, meanwhile, he, having identified not only Mark, but also the -- the place in which he was maintaining an artist's studio on Fulton Street in Brooklyn, the F.B.I. commenced a complete surveillance of this individual not only where he operated the artist's studio in Brooklyn, but also where he lived in the Hotel Latham in Manhattan, across the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.216" offset="948224">On June 20th, 1957, the F.B.I. having previously alerted Immigration and Naturalization, both being component parts of the Department of Justice, to the existence of the suspected espionage agent, on June 20th, conferred in Washington with Immigration and Naturalization and requested Immigration and Naturalization to apprehend the man on an administrative warrant normally used by Immigration and Naturalization to apprehend the person with deportation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2023.660" offset="8198040">Now, what are these problems and what are the basic issues that this Court should resolve?</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.032" offset="8223535">The basic issue is the measure to which it -- a -- those possessing power of internal security in any country are permitted, in the interest of internal security, to infringe the constitutional rights of people living in that country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.746" offset="8330324">Now, this is a very old problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.380" offset="8344848">It existed back with the Roman emperors as to who controlled the praetorian guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.563" offset="8373582">It existed under the Medicis.</text>

            <text syncTime="2076.759" offset="8410363">It existed in our own date, culminating in the Gestapo in Nazi Germany and the Cheka in Soviet Russia.</text>

            <text syncTime="2130.662" offset="8626030">Now, in the United States, until the National Intelligence Act of 1947, the United States had never had a true intelligence and counterintelligence setup.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.186" offset="8688097">In England, they've had it since the time of Queen Elizabeth.</text>

            <text syncTime="2169.488" offset="8781302">And G2 and O&amp;I, and these various set of forces actually worked all alone -- it is very little communication between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.979" offset="8827277">For the first time during World War II, a coordinated United States Intelligence Service was created.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.835" offset="8862699">Now, at the conclusion of World War II, with the dissolution of the Office of Strategic Services, this tremendously important problem was reviewed by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.936" offset="8911078">It's perfectly evident that in a day of intercontinental missiles armed with thermonuclear warheads, it is vitally important to the United States that we -- the -- the decisions that we make are policy decisions by the President, by the State Department, be informed decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.769" offset="8998431">This is very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.458" offset="9005223">To what extent can we ascertain the -- not only the capabilities of foreign nations, but their intentions toward the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.066" offset="9047646">If for example we had reliable intelligence that the Communist world did not intend military conquests, but were relying on economic warfare and propaganda, think of the tremendous impact his would have on the day-to-day economy and tax problems in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.600" offset="9129775">Now, bearing all these in mind, in 1947, after several years of study of this problem, Congress acted and Congress created the Central Intelligence Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.526" offset="9201455">Now, citations to all these appear in my briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.355" offset="9216815">You'll find no reference to any of these matters in any of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.239" offset="9240325">But the Court will find when it examines these statutes and the legislative history of them that while on the one hand, Congress was very determined to -- to create a permanent Central Intelligence Agency such as now exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.254" offset="9316394">It was equally determined to see to it that that agency did not operate within the continental borders of the United States, where it could become an agency in which the internal security functions began to transcend the rights of our individual residents in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.119" offset="9407822">Accordingly, the Court will find that just as Congress caught out this area for the Central Intelligence Agency, they reserved all domestic problems to the Federal Bureau of Investigation within the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.932" offset="9479084">Now, this is what this case is all about.</text>

            <text syncTime="2356.779" offset="9530493">Now, in my principal briefs, on page 12, I caught the Court's attention to an extraordinary statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.613" offset="9593814">And I would like to read this statement to the Court because it is so pertinent to what this case is really all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.764" offset="9626415">And I want to read it for the simple reason that although this statement was included in the first affidavits I submitted in the United States District Court, from that day to this, no reference to this statement has ever appeared in any Government brief, nor any reference by the District Court, nor by the Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.780" offset="9714500">Now, what does this say?</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.918" offset="9723068">First of all, it is taken from a bestseller which by now has been read by hundreds of thousands of the United States citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.003" offset="9771342">The title of the book is, “The FBI Story” by Whitehead.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.022" offset="9791509">And as I point out, the foreword is authoritative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.872" offset="9814810">It's by J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the F.B.I.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.643" offset="9829961">He states that the F.B.I. has complete confidence in the author's integrity, ability and objectivity and the facts reported are supported by the Bureau's record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.728" offset="9874265">Now, with respect to how this law enforcement agency which has these counterintelligence powers is operating today with respect to a suspected espionage agent, what do they say?</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.898" offset="9946990">“The F.B.I. conducts two types of security investigations, one-to-one cover admissible evidence, to be used in the prosecution of an individual or group in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.456" offset="10009161">The other for intelligence purposes only.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3978.900" offset="16018996">But I think it's important to examine what the nature of arrest is in regard to whether you would find properly that the incidence of arrest that you recognized in criminal proceedings should attach.</text>

            <text syncTime="4010.550" offset="16145533">And I think in this particular area, there is not much division in the Court as to -- assuming this was a crime, an arrest for a crime, what were the proper things that could be done in -- in regard to a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="4029.077" offset="16219721">When you get away from the person or what's immediately in his presence, then there is -- has been a difference in the Court in some of the opinions as to how far you could go in regard to the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="4042.163" offset="16272071">And Harris permitted it and even so far as four rooms.</text>
            <text syncTime="4045.989" offset="16287326">But the reason that has been traditionally recognized in this Court, as long as this subject has been discussed by the Court's opinion, has been that you can't expect a man to be an officer -- to arrest a man without giving him a certain basic authority to protect himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4067.860" offset="16374784">Now, so you always permit, if you're going to let him take somebody in custody and I say this is always -- this is only been applied to criminal cases up to date, but I -- I'm trying to show that it applies properly to an immigration case to where you take him into custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="4085.398" offset="16445001">Because you have the same problems of whether the man is going to try to escape and whether or not, if you find on this person and looking for anything that he might try to use in -- to escape, like a physical weapon of that kind or a blunt instrument or anything else, that knife that he could use, then if you find instrumentalities of a crime, or if you find contraband on this person, it seems to me that the Court has been generally in agreement over the years that you could take those as a part.</text>
            <text syncTime="4122.755" offset="16594422">Now, it's the same problem that the officer has in regard to taking the man into custody for immigration purposes that it is for taking him into custody for a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="4135.951" offset="16647189">And that -- if you don't -- you can't accomplish anything, if a man is going to be able to keep his gun and get away right away or a knife or other instruments.</text>
            <text syncTime="4145.606" offset="16685746">And it's always been recognized that once that if you can do that, then if you run across instruments out of a -- a crime or contraband, that the Government just doesn't have to say, “Well; we he won't pay any attention to those” and has been -- been permitted to take them.</text>

            <text syncTime="5635.312" offset="22644590">But beyond that, I don't think that we have a comparable situation, because what the only items in issue here were the -- these alienage, four items that I referred to and the three items, two of which were in the wastebasket and the one is slipping up his sleeve.</text>
            <text syncTime="5657.094" offset="22731734">Now, that the Government, we think that the wastebasket that was abandoned was clearly outside of any -- of the -- the most extreme position.</text>
            <text syncTime="5666.340" offset="22768724">In the Harris, the other way, would not affect in any way our right to take that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5670.648" offset="22785964">Then when we take what was up his sleeve, we say that's a special case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5674.931" offset="22803101">And all the cases, if you're going to let us search at all of his person would permit an instrument of -- of criminality if you've taken out of his sleeve.</text>
            <text syncTime="5684.138" offset="22839881">Then, when you get to the items of alienage, it isn't clear just what part of his things those were taken from.</text>
            <text syncTime="5691.684" offset="22870079">We think that burden was on the petitioner to show exactly where they were taken in order to be able to say, “He couldn't do this or that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5700.274" offset="22904456">But beyond that, we say that the -- this man was asked, “Are you going to keep your things here, in this hotel room, or you -- you want to go?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5711.424" offset="22949073">He says, “I want to take my things.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5713.665" offset="22958059">If you're going to go and I told him where, they were going to take him and arrest, “I want to take my things with me.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5720.148" offset="22983973">Now, they -- they then -- and he said he wanted to leave a few things.</text>
            <text syncTime="5724.754" offset="23002363">He wouldn't take them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5725.455" offset="23005184">He was going to throw them away.</text>
            <text syncTime="5727.099" offset="23011767">Then they proceeded to help him pack.</text>
            <text syncTime="5729.996" offset="23023365">Now, it seems to me that its -- under all of those rules regardless of the dissent in Harris and Rabinowitz in other cases that its unreasonable to ask these officers to -- if they were going to help him to not -- when they put -- picked up a piece of apparel or some other thing and help him put in the suitcase, it was wrapped around a gun and say, “Oh, we forget about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5756.609" offset="23129840">Maybe he can't get to the suitcase as fast as we can and we don't have to -- we can't touch that and the other things.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5764.595" offset="23161710">So, it seems to me, its quite different when you pick up these things to move it and by the very nature, they have to be picked up pretty much his items and put in the suitcase to see whether there's any instruments of criminality or contraband in connection with him, than if you're going around and pulling suit files or if he wasn't going to move from there, if they've gone through all the covers and search his things and handled in that matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="5809.096" offset="23339760">I'll repeat what those were.One was a fictitious birth certificate in the name of Martin Collins and that was the evidence otherwise shows very clearly that the Government knew long before this and these immigration officers knew that that was one of the aliases he used.</text>
            <text syncTime="5827.223" offset="23412276">Another was a spurious birth certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5830.307" offset="23424606">One of them, there was the Martin Collins, there was someone in existence and I think that was when it's forged.</text>
            <text syncTime="5837.309" offset="23452609">The Goldfus one was the -- for a child that had died and the parents by very curious situation had named the second child by exactly the same name, which he didn't know but he developed this spurious in the name of Goldfus which was another one of his aliases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5857.828" offset="23534634">And then he had a fraudulent vaccination certificate that he would need in connection with maintaining his position in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="5868.418" offset="23577057">That was in the name of Goldfus as I recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="5871.915" offset="23591058">And the fourth one was a savings bank of the East River Savings Bank, a bank deposit book that was in the name of Goldfus.</text>
