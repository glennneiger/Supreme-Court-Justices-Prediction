            <text syncTime="1075.025" offset="4403493">At the close of the original or the morning argument, Mr. Sibley was engaged in telling the Court the matter concerning the filings of these supplemental answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.463" offset="4445184">And he had proceeded down to the point where he stated that an answer was filed perhaps timely in the San Marino case, but where it had not been passed upon by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.830" offset="4490742">Now, in that case, if the Court will turn to page 434 of the record, you will find the interlocutory order which is presented by that Court in which in the first -- the first statement of findings in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.977" offset="4563257">In the order and he said that the allegations of the supplemental answer alleging interstate commerce and averring that this Court does not have jurisdiction or not supported by evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1131.640" offset="4629922">It was in that same hotel case that the Court then proceeded to call an election by a commissioner appointed by him to determine whether or not, the members of the defendant Union were also employees of the hotel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.946" offset="4703169">And of course, there was no machinery provided by the Florida laws for that, nor was the question material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.619" offset="4725844">The question concerned the representation, at time that the complaints were filed or the time that the picketing commenced, which was shortly probably thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.725" offset="4762311">So, it didn't make any difference what the choice of the employees was later on, if, in fact, the Union had no right to picket the plaintiff's property at the time that the complaint was filed, it made no difference what state of facts may have existed subsequently, which gave the employees the right to determine as to the Union being its collective bargaining agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.047" offset="4839528">I think that's a self-evident proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.110" offset="4851858">The criticism which counsel directed to the action of the Florida Supreme Court in reversing that part of the decree, I thought, was not well founded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.177" offset="4884041">That was the part of the order, namely, the right of the Commissioner to hold the election, which was the only part it was addressed to the Supreme Court of Florida on the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.358" offset="4920822">It was all that the Court had before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.598" offset="4933778">So, when it reversed the case for all of any authority and the chancellor conducts such an election, that was all that the Court could do, and that's all that it presumed to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.035" offset="4979545">But in that opinion of the Supreme Court of Florida on that appeal, it held that the evidence had not been shown by the -- by the Union to establish its contention that it was the bargaining agent of these employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.160" offset="5040044">Now then, when the cases came back -- and a rather significant point is made that that's in the petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.604" offset="5073795">When the cases came back, it was, in effect, concluded by all the parties that it had been thoroughly tried and there was no more falling use in taking testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="1537.067" offset="6251604">The last point I'd like to make or the next to the last point is this question as to whether the advertising involves because there was no strike, because the question which Mr. Sibley raised, the last question is the question of violence which Your Honors have been discussing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.200" offset="6312208">Now coming back to the first, on the commerce question, on the question of preemption, this issue was raised by supplemental answer before final hearing in every case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1582.115" offset="6431848">The courts in every one of the case, including the San Marino in its ultimate resolution, found that the material which the party stipulated could be considered as a proper testimony, was immaterial and irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.040" offset="6495483">And finally, at no point until their brief was filed here, was it ever suggested that this question was not been properly raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.210" offset="6532263">The question was (Inaudible) on the merits in the Supreme Court of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.491" offset="6557341">And I refer to you to the record in which we -- because we anticipated that some sort of question might be raised, we asked to have to put in the record, the briefs, which were filed in the Supreme Court of Florida, because the Supreme Court of Florida didn't pass it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.823" offset="6610631">And Your Honors will look at our record that's page 77 to 78, which is the brief covering 17 of the cases, at pages 1040 to 1043, the respondents here argued that it didn't make any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.375" offset="6664861">Of course, this argument was made before the Guss case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.433" offset="6677086">Now, the Guss case has been decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.621" offset="6689834">They decide that they're not very good on the merits, so they better go back and rely upon the fact that the supplemental answer wasn't filed within 20 days in the trial court, even though they stipulated that a witness would testify in support of the defense alleged in the supplemental answer and without objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.963" offset="6755244">For the reasons which we indicated in our reply brief, it's clear they can't raise that kind of procedural irregularity at this stage of the game.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.500" offset="6789413">Now, in the -- let's say that the counsel said that this question wasn't ever before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.159" offset="6816057">In the (Inaudible) case, in their petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida at page 381, you will find they reside in the fact that this question had been raised in the trial court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1884.672" offset="7642049">The trial court sustained this best evidence rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.185" offset="7652080">They put the card to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.824" offset="7658663">Now, the cards were sometimes signed to take the man walked up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.950" offset="7671202">They say, "Therefore, he had not designated the Union prior to the time of the picketing began because the card has that date on it."</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.038" offset="7695548">Even though the man was there, his testimony was not controverted, some of them had been members of the Union for years but hasn't signed the card designated to the Union as its representative at that particular hotel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.188" offset="7736090">So that's the whole business about the card.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.901" offset="7742986">Now, the Supreme Court of Florida never really reached that issue, because in the second case, the second Boca Raton case, they said, "You can't picket even if you show," -- and the exact words of them, “That you represent an insignificant number or a majority, if you don't tender your evidence that you represent them before you begin picketing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.726" offset="7834311">And of course, in the (Inaudible) case where they tendered the certified statements from the public accountant and the Supreme Court of Florida reversed the denial of an injunction on the basis of Boca Raton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.401" offset="7881017">What that means is that you have to give them the names, the signed cards.And if you don't do that, you can't picket in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.051" offset="7911528">And that's the essence of what Florida held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.427" offset="7921037">For that reason, the question of who was what never occurred to anybody, and we didn't bring the signed -- the exhibits, the cards, that's the only thing that's missing here into the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.959" offset="7967222">Now, if I may, Your Honor, just one more thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.325" offset="7980701">On the question of violence, in only -- since this question has been asked, in only the first cases before the first Saxony opinion, did anybody tried to prove violence?</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.658" offset="8033991">And those are the cases in which all of which that are here, the courts found no violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.625" offset="8057919">After that, they alleged it, in some cases, they didn't put on a witness for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.028" offset="8079444">And of course, there was nothing to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.931" offset="8087071">Any reading of the Fontainebleau opinion in which the trial court incidentally also found no violence, but was reversed by the Supreme Court of Florida in which they mentioned everything in the book that the whole all of these injunctions, 12 were sustained on the ground of violence advising to face first to the Fontainebleau opinion and their own briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.029" offset="8167528">Because in the Supreme Court of Florida in these cases, they did not argue even in the Casablanca case, which there had been violence, they didn't even argue that the injunction could be sustained upon any violence theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.952" offset="8215176">But once the Supreme Court of Florida came out with this (Inaudible) you have to tender the cards before you can picket, that's all I have to show and that's all they are now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.239" offset="8252374">Thank you.</text>
