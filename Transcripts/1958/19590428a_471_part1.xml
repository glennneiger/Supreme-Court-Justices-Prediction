            <text syncTime="32.455" offset="233200">Mr. Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.046" offset="255561">This is a criminal tax evasion case.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.396" offset="276982">The issue to be determined here is whether the trial court committed reversible error when it denied a defense motion to inspect what has been marked Court's Exhibit 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.638" offset="353886">The case, in bare broad outline, was roughly this.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.654" offset="378023">The petitioner's tax returns contain substantial understatements of income from dividends and capital gains.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.301" offset="420551">On the trial, it developed that on legitimate business, the petitioner was away from home each year during tax time.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.758" offset="470392">He happened to be the team physician for a major league baseball team and was down south on spring training.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.231" offset="508322">His returns, the tax return forms were signed by him in blank.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.344" offset="548760">He left in New York checks signed in blank to cover the payment of his taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.565" offset="585644">His returns were prepared and the blank checks were filled out by a firm of certified public accountants in which his brother-in-law, Arthur R.Sanfilippo, was the senior partner.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.487" offset="657324">His returns were certified by Sanfilippo or his partner and filed in New York, together with the checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.666" offset="694000">The returns were never seen by the petitioner after they were filled out nor copies -- nor were copies of them given to or seen by him.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.267" offset="740394">The defense in the case, thus, was reliant on the accountants.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.879" offset="766934">The Government's theory was that the petitioner had given false information to his accountants and he withheld true information from them, and that he had done all this with intent to evade.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.028" offset="827434">An important element in the Government's proof was Government's Exhibit 6, and the evidence offered by the Government as to when and under what circumstances Exhibit 6 was first received by the accounting firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.408" offset="904965">The defense contention was that Exhibit 6 was, first, delivered to the accounting firm early in 1952 for use in preparing the petitioner's 1951 return.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.494" offset="969331">There was substantial evidence supporting the defense position.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.400" offset="997021">The Government's theory was that Exhibit 6 was, in effect, petitioner's secret, a little black book.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.660" offset="1042056">That it was withheld and concealed from the accountants.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.261" offset="1056371">That it was not produced by him or given to his accountants until after -- long after the criminal tax investigation of his affairs had been begun.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.786" offset="1126484">It is now appropriate to have a look at Exhibit 6.I've requested the Clerk to afford the Justices a copy, and I've given one to the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.976" offset="1175280">It is a list of dividends in the doctor's own handwriting, the petitioner's own handwriting.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.145" offset="1215927">The hieroglyphics or hand tracks are stock market symbols.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.524" offset="1253439">The total dividends of the pertinent class shown on Exhibit 6 for 1951 is $16,900 plus.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.330" offset="1292727">In his tax return for 1951, the dividends in this class that were reported were only $3800.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.194" offset="1344136">Needless to say, the prosecutor and counsel for the petitioner fought over that piece of paper, from the beginning of the trial to the end, like two terriers over a bone.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.608" offset="1409755">Whichever could make off with it would, in all probability, make off with the case as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.418" offset="1449044">To prove its position, the Government relied on the testimony of Mr. Sanfilippo, the senior partner of the accounting firm, and elicited from him, on direct examination, the following testimony on page 27 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.933" offset="1539114">The question I show you, Government's Exhibit, for identification, “Can I ask you to tell the Court and jury if you have seen that before?”</text>
            <text syncTime="368.781" offset="1578506">Answer, “Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="370.598" offset="1585716">Question - “when did you first see it?”</text>
            <text syncTime="373.879" offset="1598882">Answer, “During the course of the tax examination of Mr. Mishler in 1953.”</text>
            <text syncTime="382.332" offset="1632737">Question, “Who gave it to you?”</text>
            <text syncTime="384.426" offset="1641096">“The defendant.”</text>
            <text syncTime="387.408" offset="1653008">On cross-examination, there being doubt as to just what Sanfilippo meant by “during the course of a tax investigation,” the counsel for petitioner pinned the witness down and, on page 81 of the record, it appears that the witness testified that he received it after the agent asked for additional information and after he, Sanfilippo, had asked the taxpayer for additional information.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.486" offset="1793337">This testimony was absolutely false and demonstratively so.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.378" offset="1824893">And, without laboring the details of the evidence, I refer the Court not only to our main brief, but matters analyzed on page 10 of our reply brief which the Court may examine at its leisure.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.877" offset="1882885">The defense, then, brought out that the testimony of the witness on this point had vastly changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.900" offset="1938996">It had begun, months before, with a flat sworn statement, “I do not know when I got this.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.135" offset="1995943">I can't remember it.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.598" offset="2005765">I cannot account for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.824" offset="2014647">I have no recollection.”</text>
            <text syncTime="482.423" offset="2033037">One year-and-a half after that testimony was given, this witness testified upon trial to a direct, clear, positive, and damning recollection that he got it at a definite time for a definite purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.388" offset="2148916">The process -- the story had gone through a process of evolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.643" offset="2189981">On July 16, 1956, when he was examined by the special agents under oath, and this was the first time they ever asked him about this exhibit, he said “I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.719" offset="2258213">I don't remember it.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.024" offset="2263437">I can't account for it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="543.647" offset="2277961">Six weeks later, the special agents had him in again, on August 23, 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.837" offset="2334699">They showed him copies of the doctor's returns and Exhibit 6, and they made him compare them.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.193" offset="2400110">The message was plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.595" offset="2413798">Whether or not it was spelled out to him is not important now.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.980" offset="2439293">If his firm had Exhibit 6 when the defendant claimed they had it, then the firm had either been guilty of negligence of the most aggravated character or Sanfilippo was a co-conspirator, a codefendant in a conspiracy case.</text>

            <text syncTime="652.192" offset="2712116">Those interpretations were placed there by Mrs. Irene LaCombe, who had been a clerk in the Sanfilippo's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.970" offset="2751300">She testified unequivocally that she put them there in December 1952 while working in preparation of the defendant's 1951 return.</text>

            <text syncTime="975.533" offset="4005491">The next time was August 23, 1956, when he signed an affidavit and he had a conference with the agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.539" offset="4049481">When we reached that point on the trial, we moved for the production of any memorandum made by the agent, showing what Sanfilippo had said to him in this conference with respect to this subject matter and the others on the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.810" offset="4134640">It appeared that the conference lasted three-and-a half hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.992" offset="4155329">There was a memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.277" offset="4160449">It consisted of four typewritten pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.782" offset="4170480">It was dated the same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.838" offset="4178735">It was made within several hours after the conference by Special Agent Harper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.879" offset="4198902">It was later signed also by Special Agent McGowan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.500" offset="4213321">It was made under circumstances establishing awareness on the part of the agent that the case literally hang on what Sanfilippo was saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.218" offset="4256266">Unless the agent was lacking in intelligence, and he was a very good and fine and honest agent, he knew that he was questioning a man who would be either a codefendant or the principle witness for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.869" offset="4318856">According to what we have learned from the Government's statements, it consisted -- it constituted the agent's summary of what he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.746" offset="4358353">He -- and, under our view, there is no question that, unless defense counsel saw what was in that memorandum, unless counsel saw how this testimony had been evolved from total lack of recollection to total recall incriminating the defendant, then he simply could not get a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.343" offset="4500773">May it please the Court, I'm a trial lawyer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1118.644" offset="4577991">As a trial lawyer, I say with deep sincerity, and if I am not given access to what that man said to the agents on this occasion in whatever form, it may be recorded, I have been deprived of a fair opportunity to cross-examine the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.588" offset="4693765">Until I came here, yesterday, I felt strongly that the statute was not exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.303" offset="4720619">I still think that a “substantially verbatim recital” can embrace a single sentence which says, in substance, he said to me so and so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.608" offset="4781850">That could be an intelligent, reasonable, constitutional interpretation of the statute, but the Government says that that is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.740" offset="4838379">I made that point, but I say to the Court that if, under the circumstances here presented, the statute says that a court cannot, and this Court did not even examine the document, there is an error in the Government's brief, the Court did not examine the document.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.216" offset="4936286">It says to me, “You cannot see it or any part of it,” then, I say that justice has not been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.389" offset="4992920">The motion should have been granted, just as required, no less.</text>

            <text syncTime="1411.938" offset="5751097">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.850" offset="5766771">I do not like to take an undue amount of time in discussing the facts of the case in as much as the Court does have statutory and constitutional questions before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.774" offset="5838451">However, in as much as the Government's position on the statute has already been elaborated in the proceeding case, particularly, in relation to its application to memoranda or summaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.871" offset="5902817">I think perhaps that it may be helpful to attempt to place the issue as to production, as it arose in this case, more clearly in its setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.045" offset="5955584">And, I do wish to review very briefly the nature of the proof and to indicate the theories of the prosecution and defense and precisely how this issue arose and how it was handled by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.179" offset="6032071">In view of the difficulty of dealing with figures, I have asked the Clerk to distribute a chart which has several tables in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.090" offset="6083688">Now, I want to call the Court's attention, if I may, at the outset, that this case involves tax evasion not merely for the year 1951, but for three years, 1950 to 1952 inclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.566" offset="6145651">And, that the defendant was convicted on all three counts and that concurrent sentences were handed down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.623" offset="6173863">Now, actually, the proof went back beyond 1950 and showed that the pattern of under reporting went back at least as far as 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.438" offset="6229138">The first table on this form which I've submitted to the Court is simply drawn from the tax returns, and it shows a comparison of the income reported by Dr. Palermo on his original return with the income which he ultimately reported on his amended return for the same year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.574" offset="6309700">He filed amended returns for these five years in 1956, some-four years after the tax investigation by the Internal Revenue agents began.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.208" offset="6376155">The Court will observe the discrepancy as between the amounts reported on the original and the amended returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.947" offset="6411160">Perhaps, the biggest variation is in 1951, $9000 reported originally, $31,000 ultimately reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.472" offset="6457240">Now, the second table shows dividend income returns, and we have that table here because the under reporting was concentrated in the area of under reporting of dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.295" offset="6516590">The other area was under reporting of capital gains on the sale of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.441" offset="6541145">Now, the Court will see from Table 2 that, in 1950, for example, 14,000 in dividends was reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.375" offset="6584822">The actual figure should have been 33,000 in dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.186" offset="6604152">In 1951, the variation is 13 against 30.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.084" offset="6623692">The least discrepancy is in 1952, and the 1952 return was filed after the Treasury agents had begun an investigation into taxpayer's 1951 returns.</text>

            <text syncTime="1650.611" offset="6705821">These are conceded figures now filed by the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.462" offset="6725256">In every year, except 1952, far less than half of Dr.Palermo's dividends were reported and, of course, as the first table indicates, far less than half of his net income was reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.811" offset="6782621">But, actually, that doesn't begin to give the full picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.146" offset="6795995">One can narrow this evasion to a smaller area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.324" offset="6816684">Dr. Palermo bought stock in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.883" offset="6834866">He bought it on margin through margin accounts and he bought it outright.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.588" offset="6861720">Stock bought on margin, of course, does not become the registered stock of the buyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.963" offset="6887215">It remains, in the term of the trade, in street name and the dividends on such margin stock go to the broker and not directly to the ultimate purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.453" offset="6941236">As a result, all of the dividends on the margin account purchaser -- purchases went through the brokers and the brokers kept regular formalized records, and they submitted monthly statements to the -- to Dr. Palermo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.807" offset="7010617">Now, of course, those regularized monthly statements would be readily acceptable to any tax investigator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.691" offset="7038098">There was not evasion in respect of the dividends received on securities bought on margin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.293" offset="7068505">The evasion was concentrated in the area of the securities which were bought outright, the securities that the doctor had in his vault, which he might have been holding for six months or a year or five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.099" offset="7131721">The figures in Table 3 show the under reporting of dividends on stock which was owned outright by Dr. Palermo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.427" offset="7177070">Here is a man who received, in 1950, over $18,000 in dividends on his outright owned securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.015" offset="7207476">The figure he gave the accountant as representing his dividends for that year was 4000 on such securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.239" offset="7236315">In 1951, the discrepancy is over 20,000 received and 3800 reported as representing dividends on this class of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.086" offset="7287724">Table 4 on our chart, over which I shall not linger, indicates the amount of capital gain on the sales of securities which were not reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.836" offset="7330670">One further word about the under reporting of dividends, the outright owned securities were held some in the name Dr. Palermo and others in the names of nominees - Dr. Palermo's mother, a niece, a former lady employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.787" offset="7418546">It was conceded that all of the dividend checks which were made payable to these nominees were endorsed and cashed by Dr.Palermo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.453" offset="7457207">It appears that at no time were any of the dividends received by these nominees reported by the doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.700" offset="7502137">Now, I come to the question of how the doctor's tax returns were prepared and, to the -- briefly, to the evidence on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.059" offset="7547591">As the Court has heard, the doctor's brother-in-law, Sanfilippo, was an accountant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.033" offset="7575489">Sanfilippo's partner, Amoruso, was a friend of the doctor also, some-30 years standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.229" offset="7612270">They both testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.892" offset="7622928">Dr.Palermo did not testify, so we have nothing from him as to his relationship with his accountants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.405" offset="7653021">Both the accountants testified and they both said that they never, at any time, made any investigation, any audit or any form of accounting inquiry into the figures which represented the doctor's dividends on the securities which he owned outright.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.580" offset="7733687">As to the margin account stocks, they got -- he furnished them his broker's monthly statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.334" offset="7760750">As to his other stocks, held in his name or by his nominee, they got the information from him and they took the figures, they testified, as submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.956" offset="7807248">They said they weren't paid to make an audit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.830" offset="7818742">That they relied on the figures which he gave them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.756" offset="7838386">Normally, they said those figures were provided to them over the telephone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.769" offset="7858448">Now, I'd point out parenthetically that even if contrary to the testimony of the accountants, they had information accessible to them so that they should have known that he was grossly understating his income, assuming that they were winking at the evasion, that would hardly serve to exonerate the doctor who gave them these grossly inadequate figures, who stood to profit by it, and who must have known, I submit, that he was hardly paying the taxes that were due.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.527" offset="8013511">In one year, for example, Dr.Palermo had over $30,000 in dividends, as well as income from his medical practice, income from rents on properties that he owned, more than $30,000 of dividends, I emphasize, and he paid a total tax of less than $2000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.237" offset="8080280">Was he unaware of what was going on?</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.926" offset="8099088">I must defer on the suggestion that he filed, “gave blank checks to his accountants and signed all of his returns in blank,” because the evidence only supports, in our view, including the references cited by petitioner in his brief, that one -- the return in one year was signed in blank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.007" offset="8187382">But, all of this apart, let us consider the Government Exhibit 6, the document by which the defense seeks to suggest fault or complicity on the part of the accountants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.665" offset="8246000">Your Honors have seen the report -- the form, I should say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.671" offset="8270033">It's a blank form of the kind that a brokerage firm gives out to customers so they can note, in daily journal form, the dividends that they receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.636" offset="8309948">Now, there's no question that, at some point, the accounting firm received this report -- this form, and the question is just when it was received, it being --</text>

            <label>Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer</label>
            <text syncTime="2086.596" offset="8449755">Our primary argument in all of these cases is, of course, that summaries, as distinguished from substantially verbatim transcripts or signed statements, are not producible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.073" offset="8503672">And, I've been giving this because it bears both on any question of harmless error, if there was error, and -- but there was not error is our first argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.555" offset="8545573">I've been giving it with that partly in mind, but also, since there has been some discussion of the fact to the try to give the benefit of -- the Court the benefit of understanding the precise issue or production as each developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.313" offset="8604609">And, I am gradually trying to focus in on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.641" offset="8625925">As I say, the question as to this Steiner-Ralls form, so-called, it's the sort of stature Your Honors have, is when the accountants got it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.661" offset="8678066">The defense suggests that if the accountants got it before March 15, 1952 that, then, they were negligent, at the least, in showing $3800 in dividend on outright owned securities because this form, if you add up, shows some $16,000 in dividends on outright owned stock for 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.609" offset="8781824">Now, I think there are various circumstances which support Sanfilippo's testimonies that this was not available to the firm in 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.161" offset="8831979">In the first place, as the Court has noted, this is a continuing daily journal kind of entry and, if the doctor submitted he has paid this paper to the accounting firm which normally took some weeks at least to makeup his return, presumably, he'd start a fresh piece of paper to show his 1952 dividend, but this continues uninterrupted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.527" offset="8945455">In the second place, there was the testimony of Amoruso who supervised the preparation of the return for 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.692" offset="8986102">And, he testified that the doctor gave him the $3800 figure which was in the worksheets and found its way into the return, that the doctor gave him the $3800 figure over the phone, and that he never saw this paper when he prepared the 1951 return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.486" offset="9057364">In the third place, we find that Dr.Palermo, himself, has never claimed that he gave this form to the accountants before the tax return of 1951 was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.911" offset="9099055">Agent Harper, the same agent who subsequently spoke to the witness Sanfilippo, interviewed Dr. Palermo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.273" offset="9132492">Dr. Palermo told Harper that he could not recall when this form was given to the accountants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.557" offset="9173556">The only suggestion that the accountant had it in 1951 or in early 1952, when the 1951 return was prepared, is by a lady who worked in the firm, Mrs.LaCombe, whose testimony, far from being unequivocal, showed a great deal of confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.552" offset="9257566">She testified that she had seen this form, she thought, when the 1951 return was made out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.347" offset="9288808">She also testified that that was when a Mr. DeGeorge, another employee of the firm, worked there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.250" offset="9320364">When it was pointed out to her that Mr. DeGeorge did not work there until a considerably later date, she finally testified at Record 292, I refer the Court to the top half of the page, that it could have been in 1952 or it could have been in 1953.</text>

            <text syncTime="2454.109" offset="9919822">They wanted to find out what additional was owing and there would have been just as much reason for her to go over the dividends then as at any prior time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.385" offset="9952946">And, that brings me to Sanfilippo's testimony and the effort to impeach Sanfilippo, of course, is the effort which leads to the issue as to production in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.291" offset="10004564">Now, Sanfilippo testified on more than one occasion, and I would like to take his statements chronologically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.164" offset="10036015">On July 16, 1956, Sanfilippo was interviewed by Agent Harper for some-three hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.966" offset="10071228">A transcript to that interview was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.609" offset="10081782">It became available to the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.252" offset="10092335">The Court has copies of it, marked Y (7).</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.949" offset="10115218">At pages 32 and 33 of that transcript, Sanfilippo said to Agent Harper that he didn't recall when he got this Steiner-Ralls form or when he first saw it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.130" offset="10167881">The next month, in August of 1956, Sanfilippo returned to the agents' offices and was with them for some-three-and-a half hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.765" offset="10218454">At this interview, Sanfilippo examined the transcript of the prior July interview.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.527" offset="10249488">He made certain corrections which appear of the face of that transcript and any initial of those changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.184" offset="10280103">At that second meeting with Agent Harper, he executed a supplementary affidavit that was made available to the defense, and the Court has that as Exhibit Z7.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.014" offset="10347395">Sanfilippo said that he -- well, outspoken in part, he said in that supplementary affidavit “I recall that Mr. Mishler,” Mishler was the first Revenue agent who looked into the taxpayer's affairs, his investigation having began in December 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.256" offset="10424404">“I recall that Mr. Mishler requested additional information concerning the doctor's dividend income and I believe that Dr.Palermo supplied me with this form with a notation of dividends at that time.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.796" offset="10478529">Now, the record shows Mishler was a witness, that Mishler commenced his investigatin in December 1952, that he called upon Dr.Palermo at that time to come in and reply, if he would talk about his tax affairs, and that Mishler questioned Dr.Palermo in December 1952 as to apparent discrepancies in dividend income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.052" offset="10583542">Now, the next time, the third time that Sanfilippo spoke about the date of receipt of the Steiner-Ralls memorandum was before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.336" offset="10628681">The grand jury minutes, over the Government's objection, were made available to the defense in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.438" offset="10653132">They're marked W (7).</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.283" offset="10664521">And, at page 28, Sanfilippo, quite consistently with his supplementary affidavit, told the grand jury that the firm received the Steiner-Ralls dividend form after the commencement of the tax investigation by Mr. Mishler.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.298" offset="10728573">And, at page 29, he says he did not see it prior to preparation of the 1951 return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.963" offset="10755218">But, finally, we come to the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.825" offset="10766712">Again, Sanfilippo testified that he did not have this dividend form when preparing the 1951 return and that it was his recollection that Palermo -- Dr.Palermo's submission of this form was precipitated by the action of Agent Mishler in December 1952, calling Palermo in and questioning him about his dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.628" offset="10861902">Sanfilippo also explained how his recollection came to be refreshed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.888" offset="10882905">He said that, after the July meeting with Agent Harper, he went back and talked with his partner, Amoruso.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.416" offset="10917073">It then came back to him, he said, that the occasion of their receiving this form, and usually they'd receive figures from the doctor over the phone, sometimes lump sum figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.658" offset="10958033">It came back to him, he said, that the occasion of receiving this form was that concern had been engendered by Mishler's interrogation of Dr. Palermo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.627" offset="11013831">Mishler emphasized, when he called Dr.Palermo in, that there were apparent discrepancies of dividend income.</text>

            <text syncTime="2797.157" offset="11291982">The Assistant advised the Court that he had a memorandum which Agent Harper had prepared after that meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.014" offset="11327404">He said it was not a substantially verbatim transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.204" offset="11348198">The Court asked defense counsel on what basis he thought he was entitled to production of the memorandum, indicating that the Court did not believe that he would be entitled to it if it were a memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.989" offset="11427297">Now, defense counsel did not seek to challenge the representation of the Assistant United States Attorney that this was merely a memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.836" offset="11470764">He accepted that representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.912" offset="11479019">I think I can say that with confidence, when the record shows, and I refer the Court to Record 153, counsel stating in a colloquy with the Court, the Court, “Mr. Newcomb, how do you hope to bring yourself within 3500 (e)?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.563" offset="11553625">And Mr. Newcomb says “I do not hope to bring myself within it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.832" offset="11570657">I do not think I belong within it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.976" offset="11583300">And, so, it seems to me that the defense's reliance was on the proposition that the statute doesn't control that there may be some provision for getting it outside the statute, or that the statute is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.639" offset="11665951">I say that, in this case, there can be no question of procedure to determine whether the memorandum is in fact a summary or is, perhaps, a substantially verbatim transcript, though it appears to be a summary, because there was no challenge made to the representation that it was a summary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.982" offset="11771277">Now, it does not clearly appear that Judge -- from the transcript, at the time of the colloquy, that Judge Dimock read it at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.005" offset="11803355">There's no statement in the record that it was handed off, so I can't say that he read it at that time, though the record shows that the Assistant told the Court it was there for him to see.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.072" offset="11847659">I assume that Judge Dimock did, at some point, examine it because he took care to send it forward to the Court of Appeals as a court exhibit so that that Court could examine it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.788" offset="11890500">The Court of Appeals did examine it and it found that the internal evidence made clear that it was a summary or memorandum and not a substantially verbatim transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.818" offset="11946611">This Court, of course, has the -- has that Court's Exhibit 2, the Field Exhibit, before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.742" offset="11974301">And, this Court can consider that internal evidence as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.558" offset="11997602">This Court could also consider whether, if on any theory the memorandum should have been produced, it would serve any purpose to grant a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.968" offset="12051205">If it appears on the face of the document that the only information there doesn't add or subtract one whit from what was stated in the supplementary affidavit, which was executed that day and which was made available to the defense, that it couldn't conceivably be of any use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.872" offset="12118810">In that circumstance, I would certainly suppose that there would be no purpose in ordering a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.217" offset="12140231">Now, I've gone into the facts that I should attempt to make clear in concluding that by emphasizing the facts, I do not mean to suggest in any way that we do not rely basically and as our first contention on the proposition that this was a memorandum or summary and that the statute prohibited turning that over.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.882" offset="12258931">And, I haven't deem it necessary to attempt to argue further the meaning of the statute and its plain application, it seems to me, here only because the Government's position on that score has been fully elaborated in the preceding case.</text>
