            <text syncTime="80.902" offset="427029">The last time I have the privilege of arguing before this Court, our Commission had only lost once before below.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.446" offset="457122">In the instant case, we have had the unfortunate experience of having lost twice below.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.338" offset="484707">Although we lost the war, we did win a rather significant battle in the course of the campaigns in the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.139" offset="523891">It is to that only victory that I shall advert first, because I believe that the determination by Judge Wilken in the United States District Court that the deferred variable annuity policy and incidentally, may it please the Court, that in so far as VALIC and EALIC are concerned, it is plainly stipulated in this record that the policies are the same and may be considered for the purposes of this argument the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.524" offset="661504">That this deferred variable annuity policy which is found in the record at pages 567 to 578 in which Mr. Earnest, counsel for the respondents, has tendered to the Court is offered and sold by the respondents, EALIC and VALIC, as an investment contract inspite of the trimmings, the toga or appearance that it gives of being something other than that, an insurance contract as respondents claim that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.919" offset="819075">It is our contention, thus that this is a security that is being sold within the meaning of Section 2 (1) of the Securities Act of 1933 and that those companies which are selling them, EALIC and VALIC, are investment companies within the purview of the Investment Company Act of 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.113" offset="915832">And we believe that Judge Wilken's finding was and is a correct interpretation of all of the facts of the record in light of the pertinent statutes herein involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.478" offset="969331">It is our contention further that the contracts that are being offered and sold are not insurance within the intendment of Section 3 (a) (8), the exemption section of the Securities Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="257.366" offset="1132857">My colleague for petitioners, Mr. Dorsey, will deal with the question as to whether or not this is insurance and deal more completely with the question of Section 3 (a) (8).</text>
            <text syncTime="269.695" offset="1182177">But I shall confer in my labors here to the question of whether or not what is being offered and sold here is a security.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.654" offset="1221987">It was also necessary to the finding of the Court or the necessary result from the finding of Judge Wilken that VALIC and EALIC -- because what they were offering, he found was a security, were not predominantly engaged in the business of writing of insurance as is provided in the exemptive language of the Investment Company Act, Section 3 (c) thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.079" offset="1331702">Furthermore, it is our position as I've just indicated to Mr. Justice Harlan, it is not necessary to reach the question of the McCarran-Ferguson Act at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.485" offset="1377364">That if this Court is persuaded to our view that this is a security, if that's dispositive of the issue, if this Court is persuaded contrary wise and agrees with the respondents, that likewise disposes of the issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="347.605" offset="1493765">But the District Court's theory was that although it agreed with you as to your position under the Security Act, none constant, the McCarran Act did something more which took these companies out from under the SEC.</text>

            <text syncTime="388.083" offset="1655724">The district court judge dismissed our -- the Commission's complaint in an opinion in which he concluded at page 94 of the printed record that in view of the language and history of the McCarran Act, such contracts as -- are being sold by these companies and the companies are subject only to the regulation of the insurance departments of the District of Columbia and the several States in which they were qualified to do business, where such companies are licensed to do business.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.811" offset="1806608">And it was his judgment, the judgment of the -- of the District Court finally that Congress only can make such contracts in such companies ameanable to the securities laws -- Securities Act of 1933 and the Investment Company Act of 1940 in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.197" offset="1876198">Now, Judge Wilken made five fundamental findings of fact, and in that connection, I would like to call this Honorable Court's attention to SEC versus Howey at 328 U.S.293 and particularly to Mr. Justice Frankfurter's dissent from that opinion in which Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out that both the District Court and the appellate court below in that particular case were not able to find an investment contract and therefore, as a matter of judicial administration and the judicial propriety or understanding that he could not go along with the majority in the Howey case which found that under the circumstances of the offering of units in that case of citrus fruits that there was an investment contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.212" offset="2120182">Judge Wilken and the District Court, may it please this Court, made these specific findings, and I would like to call the Court's attention to them, because he heard the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.022" offset="2159470">He saw the contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.793" offset="2166575">He tried the case for 10 days and he made extraordinarily careful, preliminary and conclusive findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.737" offset="2202311">The first finding he made that is conclusive in my view is Finding 49 at Record 108.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.059" offset="2231568">The risk of profit or loss on investments is born by the contract holders.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.053" offset="2263542">And I call that to the Court's attention because the Court is mindful, I'm sure, that in the conventional insurance policy, the risk once the premium is paid, the first premium is paid and there is no question as to ensure ability, the risk of loss in the conventional policy is on the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.316" offset="2344626">In the EALIC and VALIC situations, the risk of loss remains with the purchaser throughout.</text>

            <text syncTime="587.290" offset="2452564">“A VALIC and an EALIC contract holder invest money with the respective defendants with the hope or expectation that a profit will accrue to him as a result of the management of a portfolio of securities purchased by VALIC and EALIC with the money invested by the contract holder and his expectation of profit based upon the efforts of others, applies to both the accumulation period and to the repayment or variable annuity period.”</text>
            <text syncTime="622.385" offset="2592893">The third finding, Finding 93 at Record 111, “The insurance features of such contracts do not alter the investment characteristics.”</text>
            <text syncTime="634.087" offset="2639705">Now, we concede that there are insurance features to these contracts, there are a number of standard clauses which appear in insurance contracts, but we maintain that basically and fundamentality, this Court must look at what's being offered and sold here in terms of what it's represented to be, what the -- the companies selling it, used by way of inducement to induce purchases to buy it and that by all standards and by the tests set by this very Court in Joiner and Howey, this Court can come to know other conclusion.”</text>
            <text syncTime="679.014" offset="2819427">I respectfully suggest if it follows the test in Joiner and Howey, about what is being sold here inspite of the insurance toga is nothing less than an investment contract and interest in a pool of securities and expectation of a profit from a pool of securities at some time in the future with all of the risk throughout resting upon the purchaser who gets none of the protections which the purchaser or securities gets when the registration process under the Securities Act results in a prospectus being delivered to him either before or at the time of the consummation of a sale of a, what is known as the honorable certificate of stock or security.</text>

            <text syncTime="870.180" offset="3584084">Now, VALIC claims that this is insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.727" offset="3606235">But let us take a look at the comparison between a typical mutual fund registered under the Investment Company Act, complying through the registration process under the Securities Act of 1933 for which there is a prospectus regularly available in connection with the sale of shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.623" offset="3681886">Let us compare it with VALIC which claims to be an insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.045" offset="3707591">VALIC offers seven types of policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.117" offset="3719816">All policies involve accumulation and annuity units.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.285" offset="3736534">The accumulation unit refers to the value of the shared or in the paying period and the annuity unit refers to the value computed on a slightly different basis of the payout period.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.772" offset="3790451">Either periodic or immediate purchases of units may be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.572" offset="3809677">The risk of loss is born by the purchaser.United Fund, it offers a variety of plans.All plans involved shares, either periodic or immediate purchase of shares, the risk of loss is born by the purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.082" offset="3871744">Sales method, policy is advertised as an investment, that's clear from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.362" offset="3892851">The sales literature and I call the Court's attention respectfully particularly the plaintiff's exhibit number 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.547" offset="3925556">Policies advertise investments, sale by telephone, house to house, mail use and sales literature, it's the same in the fund, absolutely the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.914" offset="3963068">Now, what happens to the money that comes in that's paid by the purchaser?</text>
            <text syncTime="969.026" offset="3979473">That is the investor which the Commission is charged with the duty of protecting through the process of disclosure under the Securities Act of 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.165" offset="4028061">Loading charges and sale expenses are deducted -- loading charges and sale -- sale expenses are deducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.083" offset="4043734">Remainder full, and invested in the portfolio securityis, exactly the same in the United Fund.</text>

            <text syncTime="1002.830" offset="4114683">Same is true in United Funds fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.066" offset="4127640">Now, we get to the question of the portfolio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.600" offset="4137775">What happens to the premiums paid in the VALIC case by the so-called policy holder who we think is the purchaser of investment contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.356" offset="4176750">What happens to the one who, under a periodic investment plan by shares in the United Accumulated Fund shares a branch of United Fund's fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.143" offset="4219904">The basic portfolio here, very interesting in terms of the representation made in exhibit 21 in the sales literature which I call to the Court's attention very interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.436" offset="4265148">Here, as of 05-31-57, the last information available in the record, it would appear that bonds and other debt securities account for about 16% of the portfolio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.671" offset="4338082">I beg the Court's pardon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.712" offset="4346232">Some -- somewhere as in the making of the charts, the figures were reversed on, it's just the other way around, it's 84% and I hope the Court will notice this because I will try to see that they're all correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.175" offset="4400044">That it's 84% for bonds and other debt securities as of 05-31-57 and 16% for preferred stocks and common stocks as of the same date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.475" offset="4457305">Now, the units to which the purchaser here becomes entitled must necessary flow from the appreciation and earnings of this portfolio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.615" offset="4505788">And as I will call to Your Honor's attention shortly, it's represented by VALIC that its investment is in the equity securities of American industry and this is their sales literature, it's their sale's kit and yet, the record speaks for itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.186" offset="4588126">Now, in the United Funds, there's a diversification of assets, pretty largely in equity securities, and since I am not relying on the sales literature of United Funds, I made no effort to get a breakdown as of that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.929" offset="4675062">Finally, finding number 5, anyone desiring to make economic provision -- give me the judge's findings -- for the future can buy an investment trust certificate from a securities company or investment broker and also by an annuity policy from an insurance company or in -- can now buy a variable annuity contract from VALIC or EALIC which will provide at one instrument for both investment and insurance benefits, hope that the variable annuity will carry no fixed dollar benefits and therefore, while serving as a hedge against the ill-effects of inflation will not provide any assurance against the effects of deflation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1229.777" offset="5022490">The Court seemed to agree that this contract as we call it, insurance policy as respondents call it, was a hybrid as Judge Wilken had suggested it was or in other words that it had some features.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.667" offset="5089991">Although the Court never went so far as to say it had some features of a security, it said that it had some features of this economic experimentation, this novel economic experiment which we happen to think as a security, but it also said that it had so many more features in effect that looked like the traditional insurance policy that it was compelled to conclude that this was really having been -- these companies having been licensed by the insurance commissioner of the District of Columbia in taking a look at Section 3 (a) (8) which Mr. Dorsey will deal with and together with this insurance features very briefly shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.715" offset="5262190">That Court concluded that this was not within the ambit of regulation permitted to us and taken out from under us by Section 3 (a) (8).</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.060" offset="5319659">It is apparent as I have suggested that the -- these contracts do look a lot like the conventional policies, and Mr. Earnest has tendered the Court as I've suggested, the copies.</text>

            <text syncTime="2189.273" offset="8860505">I'd like as an open statement to answer a question by Justice Harlan on the question of regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.552" offset="8901569">The issue in this case is not regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.591" offset="8921736">The issue is as to whether the contracts here involved are securities, subject to the Securities Acts or are they insurance?</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.803" offset="8962591">Regulation will flow from that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.620" offset="8981817">The pivotal issue in this case is -- are variable annuity contracts insurance within the meaning of that term as used undefined in the Securities Act, the Investment Company Act and the McCarran Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.140" offset="9063946">No provision of these Acts conferred or attempted to confer upon State Insurance Commissioners, the power to make and enforce an interpretation of this federal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.190" offset="9120162">Such a power, we submit, is a judicial one which can be exercised by the Courts alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.401" offset="9152972">Unless these variable annuity contracts are in fact insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.635" offset="9177945">The exemptions in the Securities Acts for insurance and annuity contracts are not available to respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.707" offset="9222248">The acts make this clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.945" offset="9235101">After defining the term “security” in the Securities Act and the very next provision of the Act, Section 3, the Act exempts classes of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.508" offset="9293406">Listed under the classes of securities exempted in Section 3 (a) (8), are insurance and annuity contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.690" offset="9334157">It is to be noted that insurance is not excluded from the definition of a security or by denomination in the statute itself, insurance as a security.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.891" offset="9382954">We then turn to the Investment Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.099" offset="9395806">The Investment Company Act defines an issuer as one who has issued or has outstanding securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.657" offset="9426004">VALIC needs that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.282" offset="9436453">It then defines an investment company as one investing, reinvesting, holding or trading in securities and proposes to acquire securities having a value of 40% or more of its assets, VALIC admits that it needs that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.587" offset="9517746">VALIC claims they are exempt from the Investment Company Act under Section 3 (c) (3) which states that not withstanding the definition of investment companies above insurance companies are exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.135" offset="9579917">But the Congress was very careful to define the term insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.295" offset="9604577">Obviously, so that by merely being chartered as an insurance company, you could not avoid or evade the provisions of this Act.Section 2 (a) (17) of the Investment Company Act defines in -- of the Investment Company Act defines insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.700" offset="9702170">One of the indispensible conditions which must be met to qualify as an insurance company is that the company's primary -- I'll quote now, “primary and predominant business activity is the writing of insurance or the reinsuring of risk under written by an insurance company.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.300" offset="9804570">Now, in the event that these VALIC contracts are not insurance, then VALIC is not exempt under Section or under the definition of the investment company as contained in Section 3 (a) (1) and (3) of the Investment Company Act</text>
