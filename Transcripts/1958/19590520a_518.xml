            <label>Mr. David T. Searls</label>
            <text syncTime="27.571" offset="213661">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court!</text>
            <text syncTime="32.116" offset="231842">This is a natural gas case and involves a decision by the Federal Power Commission granting Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity to these four petitioners who are four producers of natural gas authorizing them to sell their natural gas in interstate commerce to the Tennessee Gas Transmission Company which is a long line extending from Texas and Louisiana into the middle west and on into the Atlantic seaboard and in to New England.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.935" offset="371127">As a result of the order of the Commission, granting Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity to these four producers, the New York State Commission and two distributing companies, who were interveners before the Commission, filed a petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and that court reversed the Commission's order and sent the case back and set aside the order of the Commission, granting certificates for Public Convenience and Necessity to these four producers and the case is before Your Honors on certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.816" offset="530683">These four producers discovered one of the large natural gas fields and they found it out in the Gulf of Mexico, about 25 or 30 miles off the southwestern shore of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.430" offset="597138">In fact, the record shows that it is the largest natural gas reserve that's ever been committed to interstate commerce in a single sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.663" offset="637994">Each of these four producers entered into a separate contract with a pipeline company for the sale of this gas, but the contracts are substantially the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.647" offset="677909">Those contracts were made in August 1956 in which they agreed to sell this gas in interstate commerce at a price commencing at 21.4 cents per MCF plus 1 cent gathering tax with a provision that the price would escalate 2 cents per MCF each four years during the life of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.990" offset="775293">In this contract, it was provided that each of the producers would file an application for Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity with the Federal Power Commission, and it was also provided that if they did not obtain satisfactory certificates by April 1, 1957, they would have the right to cancel their contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.206" offset="860244">Pursuant to this contract, applications were filed, a hearing was held in early part of 1957, and on March 29, 1957, the examiner rendered his decision in which he found that certificates should be issued to these four producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.748" offset="938402">He stated that this was a new pricing area.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.754" offset="954389">This was a new productive area for natural gas and the examiner as a fact that the payment of the price provided for in these contracts would not escalate or trigger any of the favored nation's clauses of the other Tennessee gas contracts about which Tennessee had agreed to purchase gas onshore in Southern Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.276" offset="1060446">And that it would not disrupt the price of natural gas because it was in a new area, in a new pricing area where no gas was being delivered from at present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.320" offset="1100675">He found that he should not go into the question of price and convert this certificate case into a rate hearing, rather that he should proceed to grant certificates in this case because there was a great need for the natural gas and accordingly the certificates should issue it subject to review by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.524" offset="1181445">In a few weeks, on April 22, the Commission entered its first order.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.176" offset="1200044">In that order the Commission found that price was a very important matter here.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.026" offset="1223450">They also recognized that this supplier was very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.832" offset="1238706">That this was a very important supplier for the Tennessee gas system, an important supplier for the consumers who acquired this gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.666" offset="1274023">But -- so the Commission stated that it would issue temporary Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity to these four producers and then it would send the case back to the presiding examiner to determine at what price the Public Convenience and the Necessity required this gas to be sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.042" offset="1367542">These four producers filed their motion re-hearing and a motion to modify the order in which they stated that they could not take the economic risk of accepting temporary certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.572" offset="1417697">On the hearing, it had been proved that they had to place these leases into production by 1958 or they would lose their leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.081" offset="1451656">So they stated they could not take this economic risk, and they asked the Commission to reconsider the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.410" offset="1484988">The Commission did reconsider the matter and on May 20th 1957, the Commission entered its second order and in this order, the Commission granted permanent Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity to these four producers, but in doing so, it made these two findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.537" offset="1573491">The Commission said now there is pending before the Congress, the Harris Bill, and this Harris Bill as it is now written will take away from us the right to review the initial price, even under Section 5(A) proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.527" offset="1641514">And in view of that fact, in other words, they said in effect, we really got to review this price now or we might lose the right to review, if the Harris Bill should pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.055" offset="1683623">That particular Harris Bill had not passed up to this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.413" offset="1701073">They further found that price was a very important issue here and that the evidence was insufficient to show at what particular price level, the Public Convenience and Necessity required this gas to be sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.321" offset="1780694">After making those findings, they then ordered, that a certificate issue on the condition that these four producers rewrite their price provision and the Commission set forth in the order, in very precise language, what particular language should be written into the price order.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.559" offset="1877556">And it provided that the price should be 17 cents instead of 21.4, and that it should escalate to 21.4 and the Commission provided that on the second day after service commenced under this contract, these producers could get their full price, but that price would be suspended and they get could put that price into effect under bond and then they could try to issue as to whether or not they were entitled to the 21.4 cents as a Section 40 proceeding in which the burden rest upon the producers to establish their price.</text>

            <text syncTime="485.745" offset="2046307">That order of May 20th and the particular price provision which I am referring to Your Honor, appears on the second volume on page 530, where the Commission provides for the changing of Section 10 of the contract right at the bottom of Page 530, and sets out specifically what this initial price shall be.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.484" offset="2177337">Now this was not a satisfactory certificate to these producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.063" offset="2199594">Firstly as they didn't think the order was lawful, they did not think it was lawful, they didn't think it was in accordance with the law, but they did not file a motion for rehearing with respect to it, but the pipeline company, the Tennessee Gas Transmission Company filed a motion for rehearing, in which the pipeline company stated that the producers had advised it that they would not accept this certificate where this price condition as set forth in the Commission's order and they would elect to terminate their contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="580.271" offset="2424456">The Commission could proceed under the Section 5(A) once the price schedule is -- once the price is on file as a rate schedule, they could review it.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="588.647" stopTime="601.263">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="588.647" offset="2457997">In fact what the Commission can do is to say no, we won't do this, have a lower price and then let you test out the price before (Inaudible)</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_t_searls" startTime="601.263" stopTime="915.087">
            <label>Mr. David T. Searls</label>
            <text syncTime="601.263" offset="2508466">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.206" offset="2512227">And the Commission did what we say, the Act does not give the Commission authority to do it, they suspended that increase of 4 and 10th cents, and right of suspension is not given with respect to an initial price and they placed the burden upon us to proceed in a Section 4 (a) proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.438" offset="2589132">Now after the Tennessee Gas Transmission company filed their motion for rehearing, setting out these facts, the Commission granted the rehearing and issued another opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.743" offset="2642317">I do wish to call the Court's attention that in connection with this May 20th order, one of the Commissioners has dissented, and he dissented on this proposition, that the matter of the initial price, was a matter to be agreed upon in the contract between the buyer and the seller, and that the consumers could be amply protected in a Section 5(a) proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.950" offset="2743150">Now in this rehearing, two of the Commissioners, who had been with the majority on the May 20th order, switched over and joined Commissioner Kline who had been on the dissenting side on the May 20th order and so the three of them constituted a majority in rendering this order which is the one in issue here of June 24th 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.896" offset="2838967">Now in the June 24th order 1957, this particular order that I am referring to appears in Volume-2 of the record commencing at page-44, in this June 24th order, the Commission pointed out that this was one of the great suppliers of natural gas, that there was a need for the natural gas, and that price was not the prime determinant of the Public Convenience and Necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.954" offset="2987238">And they went on to state that they were going to grant, and they did get grant, permanent Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity to these four producers, but in doing so, they pointed this out in a opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.133" offset="3039901">They said that Sections 5(a) proceedings and investigations are already on file as to three of these four producers and this particular price after it's filed as a rate schedule will be investigated and determined in these three Sections 5(a) proceedings that are now pending against three of these four producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.726" offset="3126314">And then the Commission further said that contemporaneously with the entry of this order, we are instituting a Section 5A proceeding against the fourth producer and that was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.067" offset="3175633">And after saying that the Commission then said by this means, relief can be afforded to the consuming public, if it should be found that the 21.4 cent initial rate to be charged for the offshore gas is excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.953" offset="3251179">Now we say that the basic issue in this case is did the Commission have the discretion to enter that order and to provide that this matter of price or rate could be determined in section 5A proceedings without going in to this question of the initial rate and undertaking to the determinant in connection with the issuance of these certificates, what the initial rate should be and then placing a condition in its order limiting the rate to that which is found to be the one that might be just and reasonable or as the Commission expressed it in their pervious opinions, a particular that was required for by Public Convenience and Necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.314" offset="3452635">Now when the case was reached the Court of Appeals, they really never reached or never got to this basic issue as to whether the Commission had this discretion and whether they properly exercised the discretion in this case or whether there was an abuse of the discretion as exercised by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.568" offset="3525674">They went off on this proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.811" offset="3538631">They said that when the producer said they would not accept this May 20th order, which rewrote the price condition, price provision and made it a condition in the order, they thereby circumscribed the inquiry and the jurisdiction of the Commission and limited the jurisdiction of the Commission, because they refused to accept a certificate which reduced their price, under the terms of the May 20th order.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.227" offset="3688260">And as I say, the Commission actually never determined the issue as to whether or not the Commission had the discretion, the court never determined that question where the Commission had the discretion to issue the later order granting the certificates and saying this matter of price or rate can be determined in a Section 5 (a) proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1666.743" offset="6770395">I should like to present my very brief argument from the point of view of the pipeline company, my client, Tennessee Gas Transmission Company, which was buying this gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.868" offset="6826820">We operate a long distance pipeline that extends from the gas fields in Texas and Louisiana, way into New England.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.713" offset="6874258">Now along the route of this line, we supply gas to some 80 utility costumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.587" offset="6905710">In 1956, as is our custom, almost annually, we made a canvas for our costumers to determine their future needs for gas and we learned that some 50 of the 80 wanted additional gas supplies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.941" offset="6991182">And so we filed with Federal Power Commission in a separate proceeding, which I'll call the pipeline proceeding, docket G1107 is what it's designated, an application or a certificate to authorize the installation of a very large expansion program which would increase our capacity by come 450 million cubic feet a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.464" offset="7089194">The cost of the installation of the additional pipe and compressor stations would cost us about $175 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.936" offset="7131094">Now, obviously in order to achieve this very ambitious and substantial program to give our customers the additional service which they wanted, it was necessary for us to go out and obtain additional gas reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.855" offset="7198804">At that time, the only large gas reserve available to us, that was for sale at that time, in the area of our lines, was this particular two trillion cubic feet of gas, which we purchased from these four producers, who are the petitioners in case number 518.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.560" offset="7301622">The contract was negotiated over a period of 10 or 11 months in the hardest kind of bare-knuckle bargaining in which we tried to get the best price we could for that gas and the contract was entered into certainly at arm's length, the evidence clearly shows that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.554" offset="7377586">The evidence also shows that the acquisition of this gas reserve was of great benefit to Tennessee and its customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.083" offset="7415724">It was a very large reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.191" offset="7424188">It constitutes some 12% of our present gas supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.511" offset="7441429">It was well located with reference to our lines being only about 60 miles away from our main transmission system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.385" offset="7484897">The price was not very far out of line; certainly only it was 21.4 cents per thousand cubic feet as compared with 20 cents which was then currently being paid in numerous transactions along the Gulf Coast on dry land for smaller reserves having a lesser potential and being smaller in size than this reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.817" offset="7590640">So we bought this gas, we went to hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.226" offset="7608299">I might also add that this gas gave us an entrance into this tremendously prolific reserve out in the Gulf Coast, out in the Gulf of Mexico, where we could of course have access to still additional reserves for the future needs of our customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.379" offset="7680920">At the hearing, no evidence was presented showing this rate to be unjust or unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.206" offset="7712162">Respondents presented no evidence at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.713" offset="7730239">There was no challenge at the hearing concerning the need for this gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.006" offset="7751346">As a matter of fact, there were three orders issued in this case, three separate certificate orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.606" offset="7777782">It is the third one that is here under review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.287" offset="7788544">In the first two orders there were findings made that the gas was needed by Tennessee as well as in the third order and in those first two orders, respondents took no exception to that finding although they now begin to raise some questions about the need for the gas in their appeal on the third order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.349" offset="7880808">I might also say that respondents, while they were interveners and active participants in the pipeline phase of the case where the question of the need was very thoroughly gone into, and all of these 50 customers and their witnesses testified concerning their needs, they raised no questions there concerning the need for the gas and took no exceptions to the certificates that were offered, that were granted by the Commission in which orders the Commission found that the gas was needed and that the Public Convenience and Necessity required the installation of the facilities and the capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.240" offset="8032319">Now the order under review contains all of the statutory findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.037" offset="8087489">It finds that the Public Convenience and Necessity requires these sales and this service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.614" offset="8117791">It finds that applicants are able and willing to render the service and that they are ready and willing to conform to the provisions of the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.290" offset="8160528">The respondents make a concession, that I deem of utmost importance in this proceeding, they concede, all of them do in their briefs over and over again that the Natural Gas Act does not require a finding of justness and reasonableness of a rate as a prerequisite to the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity in a certificate proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.304" offset="8264600">And that was advised in conceding that point because one searches the four corners of the rate sections of the Act to find any such requirement even as being necessary before the Commission can make effective a rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.072" offset="8323636">For example, new rates, that is the initial rates cannot be suspended as respondents concede, therefore, they may be made effective without any finding of justness and reasonableness under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.705" offset="8390196">Rate changes may be made effective in the Commission's discretion to be sure, and may be suspended or not suspended as the Commission pleases, but the Commission can make them effective without suspension in its discretion and without a finding of justness and reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.120" offset="8463862">And in the Mobile case, this Court held categorically that the Natural Gas Act contemplates that all rates are to be established initially by the natural gas companies by contract or otherwise subject to review by the Commission under Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.401" offset="8544946">Therefore, as we see it the basic issue in this case and as Mr. Searls has correctly stated here, whether there was an abuse of discretion on the part of the Commission in refusing to impose a price condition in the certificate order, we submit that there was no abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.227" offset="8640240">The Commission explored the rate aspects of the matter as fully as was practicable under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.928" offset="8675035">Its three orders were largely concerned with and contained a full discussion of the price issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.350" offset="8712756">I say the Commission explored the rate aspects as fully as was practical short of a full blown rate case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.833" offset="8742745">The Commission concluded upon application for rehearing and I would like to quote some of the language, because I think it's quite revealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.372" offset="8772838">In the third order the Commission finally concluded upon our rehearing, upon our urgent request to save this supply of gas for our markets and our customers that “important as is the issue of price, the precise charge that is made initially is less important than the assurance of this great supply of gas”.</text>

            <text syncTime="2257.785" offset="9134477">It is around about middle of the page there and the Commission then instituted these Section 5(A) rate investigations against the producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.438" offset="9181080">Now on arriving at this decision, the Commission had before it, the following salient facts which I would like to very briefly summarize, which compelled it to reverse its earlier order and save this great supply of gas for our customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.672" offset="9238026">First, there were no comparable prices in the area here involved since which would form the basis of a price condition, since this was the first sale in this particular offshore field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.971" offset="9291212">Secondly, as Mr. Searls pointed out there, the price here involved would not trigger any increases in our other gas contracts or otherwise cause any economic disruption in the producing area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.033" offset="9351502">Thirdly, the need for the gas in the interstate market was great and time was of the essence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.160" offset="9376057">This hearing was being tried, the latter part of February and early part of March of 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.398" offset="9405001">Our customers wanted service in that winter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.080" offset="9419734">In order to get service to them, we had to build this tremendous pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.929" offset="9435094">We had make all of these arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.241" offset="9444289">We had to construct underwater marine gathering system out in to the waters in the Gulf of Mexico to connect up these 22 wells and additional wells, that were going to be drilled, we had to a tremendous amount of work to get that job done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.573" offset="9501654">The producers told us that they were going to cancel their contracts unless a satisfactory certificate was issued to them by April 1 as was their right to cancel under the agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.604" offset="9561840">There was insufficient time as respondents, well, I am sure, they admit and have admitted in their brief, there was insufficient time within which to conduct a full-blown full-scale rate investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.680" offset="9610115">It takes years to conduct such an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.641" offset="9629968">The respondents concede that within -- that it was not practicable within the time limitations of this proceeding to convert it, to convert the certificate case in to a rate case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.418" offset="9681063">The producers as I said, a moment ago had advised us definitely that they were going to cancel their contracts and thereafter dispose off their gas in intrastate markets rather than to accept the certificates issued by the Commission's first and second orders and I might say that, that is a very realistic situations with which we are confronted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.075" offset="9759640">The intrastate markets are in constant competition with the interstate markets for this gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.918" offset="9783045">For example, in Louisiana, some 42% of the gas produced there is sold in intrastate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.917" offset="9815019">In Texas, some 41% and in Oklahoma some 62% or 63% is in interstate commerce and so we weren't the only customer available to them for this gas and there is no means under the Natural Gas Act whereby a producer can be compelled to make an initial sale of gas to an Interstate Pipeline Company, and so it was at our urgent request.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.430" offset="9929122">We filed the petition for rehearing with the Commission that it modified its second order, so as to ensure that this great supply of gas would not be lost to the interstate market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.589" offset="9977710">The Commission properly recognized, the overwhelming importance of getting this gas into our lines, and committed to interstate commerce so that thereafter it could not be abandoned without an application first being made and permission granted under the abandonment provisions of the Act and so that the Commission could thereafter exercise its continuing great jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.302" offset="10080632">In these circumstances we respectively submit, that the Commission did not abuse its discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.338" offset="10108740">Now the respondents extol the virtues of the Commission's second order which contained this price condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.065" offset="10143640">They hold it up a shining example of a very beautiful device that can be used and should be used by the Commission to control producer prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.448" offset="10189197">We respectfully disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.636" offset="10201945">Not only was the order of doubtful legality as Mr. Searls has already explained, but it didn't make good economic sense and for this reason, the Commission fixed a floor of 17 cents in the price condition and said here you can charge the 21.4 cents said to the producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.464" offset="10285223">You can charge 21.4 cents while we're investigating the price, but you'll have to refund down to 17 cents if we should find after investigation that the price is too high.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.153" offset="10343946">But the 17 cents was the floor, and why did they select the 17 cents because that was the highest price that Tennessee was paying to any other producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.233" offset="10384280">Now that would put us if this is the pattern to be followed as respondents recommend to be followed and if that had been the vogue of the day, we could have never bought this gas for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.412" offset="10432972">We were paying 17 cents to our -- highest price to our producers, than anyone, but I think one single producer was receiving that much no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.623" offset="10481873">Other pipeline companies were paying 18 cents, others were paying 19 cents and some were paying as high as 20 cents, and if this type of order had been in the practice at that time, we could never sell this gas – we could never purchase this gas because obviously producers would flock to the company that was paying at that time higher prices than ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.657" offset="10581974">The Court below held sue sponte that the rejection by the producers of the price condition automatically divested the Commission of its jurisdiction to entertain the applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.772" offset="10630457">Now we agree with Mr. Searls most wholeheartedly that the court below was clearly wrong and so hold it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.778" offset="10666506">As the respondents themselves recognize, an applicant for a certificate when he applies, does not, by the filing of that application agree to accept any kind of the certificate that the Commission may choose to issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.625" offset="10725857">Indeed the Commission's rules and regulations specifically prescribe that a certificate doesn't even become effective unless it is accepted in writing by the applicant within 30 days after its issuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.694" offset="10794193">We cite on Page 35 of our main brief that's the buff colored brief, the legislative history which we think conclusively demonstrates the error of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.097" offset="10847796">And now one final word about the position of the New York Public Service Commission, they say that the Federal Power Commission has been derelict in its duty to control producer prices and has failed to do its job in stemming the tide of increase in producer prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.075" offset="10959705">We respectfully disagree and submit that there is no merit to that contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.255" offset="10984364">Since this Court handed down its decision in the Philip's case in June of 1954, the Federal Power Commission has suspended over $105 million, now that's per year, of annual rate increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.824" offset="11050715">Not only that, but the Federal Power Commission has instituted many section 5A rate investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.243" offset="11080391">As a matter of fact, as of the present time I think it is fairly correct to say, that practically every large producer of natural gas in the country is under a rate investigation by the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.376" offset="11148831">Those of us who practice before the Commission day in and day out, we are not living that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.081" offset="11179656">We represent producers and pipelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.028" offset="11187493">I think would be almost unanimous in saying to this Court that the Federal Power Commission is a mighty tough regulator of rates.</text>

            <text syncTime="2795.466" offset="11285191">In 1954, when this Court determined the Phillip's case and announced to the world that the producer of natural gas who sold its product or resale interstate commerce, was within the content of the Natural Gas Act, a natural gas company, subject to all of the provisions thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.198" offset="11388113">The going rate for producer sales in Southern Louisiana was in the neighborhood of 10 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.189" offset="11420087">In the short space of time, since the rendition of that decision in 1954 and today, we have leaped in progressive steps to as high as 24.5 cents per MCF.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.097" offset="11495737">We are here engaged in the proceeding that gave rise to the leap from 18 cents to 22 cents in one fell swoop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.989" offset="11555297">I think it is vital for this Court to know, in order to evaluate the contentions made both by the petitioners before this Court and by ourselves, how we got from the 10 cents that we started out with in the 1954, also in one fell swoop to the 18 cent level from which we started with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.306" offset="11656547">Obviously, we have been through all of these things once before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.623" offset="11673893">We know all of the ramifications of the contention that Section 5 is an adequate means of protecting consumer's interest against excessive gas prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.147" offset="11727914">We know all of the consequences that instill from precipitous increases in the initial rate, such as is here evident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.041" offset="11767515">I will be very brief in my depiction of that development from the 10 to the 18 and hasten on to this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.184" offset="11812133">That league was initiated by a sister pipeline company of Tennessee, Transcontinental Gas Pipeline Corporation; they take turns in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.201" offset="11868139">In 1954 Trans-co renegotiated a goop of its then 10 cent contracts and agreed to pay to producers 17 cents, for the gas already committed to their markets.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kent H. Brown</label>
            <text syncTime="2957.260" offset="11932400">1954, during dependency as a matter of fact, of this Court's decision in Philips and immediately after.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.417" offset="11985063">That was the Southern Louisiana area, and constituted almost immediately the elevation of the going price from 10 to 17 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.888" offset="12030934">It had these three immediate ramifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.981" offset="12047339">In the first place, the rate increase filings that were filed as a result of those renegotiated contracts, boosting the initial -- boosting the rate, charge theretofore from 10 to 17 cents under Section 4, was the first Section 4, Producer Proceeding to come before the Federal Power Commission under its new found, newly directed authority to regulate producer affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.198" offset="12204178">Those proceedings prompted -- those filings rather, prompted the Commission to suspend the 17th -- 7 cent increase in the price, for the maximum period in most cases, outside months that Section 4 allows.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.880" offset="12282859">From that period on, since 1954-55, we have, as Mr. Littman just advised, been paying in excess of $105 million a year of dollars for gas that is subject to FTC Suspension, and theoretically, ultimately, might be refunded to us, but the prospects are still of that are still very dim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.640" offset="12461955">Those Section 4 proceedings that started in 1955 are still pending before the Federal Power Commission unresolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.664" offset="12513991">The explanation lies for that rise principally, in the fact that the producers adamantly refused to supply the Commission with any cost of service evidence upon the basis of which the Commission might possibly arrive at just and reasonable rate for those producers.</text>

            <text syncTime="5443.977" offset="21879306">Indeed the Commission then said all right, we think the larger public interest requires that we handle the matter as they handle it in a second order.</text>
            <text syncTime="5453.411" offset="21917027">Now what I am asking is what you want the Commission to do now?</text>
            <text syncTime="5457.919" offset="21935000">What do you think they should do?</text>
            <text syncTime="5460.868" offset="21946807">They've considered the thing, highly observed the thing, but you say the only thing is they should consider now what more can they do?</text>
