            <text syncTime="55.651" offset="325987">The common law, as Your Honors know, when a corporation was dissolved or put to death either by limitation or forfeiture or by its own act, that was the end of the whole situation and the corporation could no longer prosecute any claims that it might have for its property and anyone who had a claim against it for compensation or for money was without remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.922" offset="495052">Therefore, it was an order to relieve against the harshness of the common law that statutes such as we have here in Maryland and Delaware were enacted to enable a corporation to -- for a limited period to recover any property that it might have or to enable those who had been injured by some civil act of the corporation to recover.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.679" offset="630053">The Maryland's -- that is fully set forth at page 15 of our brief where we quote from Fletcher on corporations in which he says, “Statutes of this type are broadly remedial and statutes for whining up the affairs of dissolved corporations or embodiment of equitable doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.062" offset="727646">They are remedial and should receive liberal constructions.</text>

            <text syncTime="399.221" offset="1700237">We -- we cover that fully on our brief and the next section I think throws further light on this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.221" offset="1740257">The dissolution of a corporation -- this is Section 78 (a) shall not relieve its stockholders, directors or officers from any obligation and liability imposed on them by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.698" offset="1798144">Now, I take if that would mean that if in case of stockholders double liability, they are not relieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.365" offset="1824789">In case of director's liability they are not relieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.321" offset="1836701">In case of unpaid stock subscriptions they are not relieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.154" offset="1851956">Labor claims sometimes are imposed upon the officers or directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.111" offset="1875780">That is the end of the Section insofar as the substance of law is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.880" offset="1898872">That is the semicolon.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.723" offset="1906291">Then follows what I submit and on very good authority is purely procedural.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.959" offset="1943176">Nor shall such dissolution abate any pending suit or proceeding by or against the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.242" offset="1972328">And all such suits maybe continued with such substitution of parties, if any as the court directs.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.000" offset="2007333">Well, of course there cannot be any substitution of parties in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.112" offset="2027813">This acts as procedural provision relates to civil procedure as I will demonstrate in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.084" offset="2063757">No receiver shall institute suit except by order of the court appointing him and such suit maybe brought in his own name as receiver or notwithstanding its dissolution in the name of the corporation to refuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.391" offset="2116942">Now, in 1956, the Supreme Court of Maryland undertook to codify the Maryland rules of procedure and they provided in those rules of procedure under Rule 222, under the heading, dissolution of a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.223" offset="2220283">An action by or against the corporation shall not abate by reason of the dissolution, forfeiture of charter, merger or consolidation of such corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.053" offset="2279633">Such action maybe continued with such change of parties as the court may direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.078" offset="2303666">Now, I take that court will immediately ask, well couldn't that be a criminal action?</text>
            <text syncTime="554.889" offset="2322892">And the answer is found in the Rules of Civil Procedure under Rule 5 definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.352" offset="2356746">It has used in these rules the following terms have the following meanings.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.164" offset="2380048">Action, action shall include all the steps by which a party seeks to enforce any right in a court of law or equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.280" offset="2416515">Unless, otherwise, indicated the word action shall include in appeal, take into a court of record from the final decision of an inferior core of administrative body where such appeal is authorized by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.399" offset="2552978">Action shall not include a criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.521" offset="2552874">And I call, Your Honor's attention to whenever the word proceeding is used to indicate criminal proceedings it's always preceded by the word criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.795" offset="2552769">In other words, the two are coupled together as they are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.096" offset="2571786">Now, as further evidence, that this provision after the semi-calling nor shall dissolution abate any pending suit or proceeding was purely procedural and not part of the substantive law.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.697" offset="2634167">After the Maryland Court of Appeals, I believe as the highest court of the State, had codified the Rules of Civil Procedure and the Rules of Criminal Procedure as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.221" offset="2696234">The legislature came along and in the laws of Maryland of 1957, and this I do not think it's in our brief, they enacted a long list of laws to remove any procedural matters from the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.471" offset="2813262">And so as eliminating doubt that this was procedural, the enacting clause says, “To remove from the code of public general laws of Maryland, procedural provisions superseded by or inconsistent with the rules or procedure approved and adopted by the Court of Appeals of Maryland on July 18th, 1956 to take effect on January 1, 1957 and known as the Maryland Rules.”</text>

            <text syncTime="743.454" offset="3077204">Now, when we come to Chapter 399 at page 544, the same volume, we find the Act passed by the legislation which is entitled “effective dissolution”.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.616" offset="3133837">And it simply says the dissolution of a corporation shall not relieve its stockholders, directors or officers from any obligations and liabilities imposed on them by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.959" offset="3195173">In other words, all of the procedural part which follows the semicolon is deleted because that is procedural.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.387" offset="3224952">It's covered by the Rules of Civil Procedure and so recognized by the legislature.</text>

            <text syncTime="794.774" offset="3282422">Now, if there ever was any doubt, it's been clarified by the legislature and by the highest court of Maryland that the only thing that continues is a civil action and that suit or proceeding relates to civil actions and does not embrace criminal actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.115" offset="3379806">And since the law is also quite clear that the state which brings a corporation into life may also put in to death or may enable it to continue for certain specific purposes and no other that Maryland has permitted by a remedial legislation a corporation to continue for the purpose of winding up, so to speak, and pay existing obligations but criminal actions are not continued and therefore abate.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.699" offset="3522121">In our brief, we've endeavored to set forth the distinction which probably is arguing the obvious between civil and the criminal prosecutions and I do not think it's necessary to argue the obvious here in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.076" offset="3623685">Certainly, the issue in a criminal case is guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.451" offset="3645210">And the fine which is all that could be imposed against the corporation does not come into existence until the preliminary issue is determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.576" offset="3685648">In a civil case the issue is whether or not the corporation had any liability to respond or compensate for matters which arose prior to its dissolution or whether he had any title of the property which it could recover.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.520" offset="3757432">Now, when we come to the law of Delaware, we find that, in substance, the same although the wording is somewhat different.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.118" offset="3807796">The Delaware statute is also in our brief and it's not too long.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.308" offset="3828590">It's at bottom of page 5, all corporations whether they expire by their own limitation or otherwise dissolved, shall be continued for three years from such expiration or dissolution embodies corporate for the purpose of prosecuting and defending suits by and against them and enable them to gradually settle and close their business to dispose off and convey their property and divide their capital stock but not for the purpose of continuing the business for which the corporation shall have been established.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.354" offset="3952828">With respect to any action, suit or proceedings began or commenced by or against the corporation, prior to the expiration or dissolution with respect to any action suit or proceeding began or commenced by or against the corporation within three years after the date the corporation shall only for the purpose of such action, suit or proceedings so began or commenced be continued body is corporate.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.791" offset="4046555">Now, there is another section of the law which says what those persons who continually may do after dissolutions?</text>
            <text syncTime="995.366" offset="4084799">It's quite clear from that section that they must apply the assets to the existing obligations and that no debt or claim exists at the time of dissolution or until the fine is levied in this case, two years thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.234" offset="4160345">At page 25 of our brief, Your Honors will find that other Section quoted.It's Section 281 and I think it appears at the bottom of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.458" offset="4229204">The trustees are receivers of a dissolved corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.064" offset="4243623">After the payment of all allowances, expenses and costs and the satisfaction of all special and general liens upon the funds of the corporation, the extent of the lawful priority shall pay other debts due from the corporation if the funds are sufficient, if not, they shall distribute the same ratably among the creditors who shall prove their debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.473" offset="4333275">And any balance remaining after the payment of the debts and necessary expenses, they shall distribute and pay to those who maybe justly entitled thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.505" offset="4381341">Rather, this clearly has reference to the civil creditors and civil liabilities and that is the only purpose for which is continued the same as under the Maryland statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.138" offset="4435884">Now, the Government argues that the public policy should motivate the court to interpret the statutes so as to include criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.243" offset="4480293">We have submitted that there's no need for doing so, particularly in this case because first place, the question is moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.018" offset="4511431">The company is no longer in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.870" offset="4522820">Secondly, the individuals who are its directors and officers are liable to punishment particularly under the antitrust laws which specifically provide that every director and officer of a corporation shall -- who participated in the acts of the corporation shall be equally guilty with the corporation that personal liability to punish or continue in this particular case, an individual officer of each one of these companies was indicted and was fined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.905" offset="4670986">The stockholders whom the corpora -- whom the counsel for the Government argues ought to be punished, it would be a startling doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.794" offset="4714559">Stockholders are not guilty of the crimes of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.358" offset="4736815">And the corporation is a completely separate and distinct entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.554" offset="4757608">And if we were endeavored to break down that doctrine, we would be molding a policy of far reaching consequences which would destroy the separate corporate entity under which stockholders enjoy various immunities and certainly it's a unique doctrine that you will punish the stockholders for the crimes of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.963" offset="4859173">Stockholders may even change from day to day.</text>

            <text syncTime="1202.614" offset="4913821">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.264" offset="4928449">This is a criminal antitrust action under Section 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act in which a large number of corporations and their subsidiaries and substantial number of individual were indicted for conspiracy to fix prices and for attempting to monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.748" offset="5022386">And all of the corporations and all of the defendants, to the best of my knowledge, pleaded nolo contendere and fines have been imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.259" offset="5056449">The question here relates to three of the corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.634" offset="5077870">One of which is the Delaware corporation, the other of which -- other two of which are Maryland corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.106" offset="5103783">Who after the indictment were dissolved and their functions were taken over by other aspects of their parent corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.153" offset="5159999">Now, the court below decided this matter by a construction of the Delaware and Maryland law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.034" offset="5199496">And they looked into the problem that Judge Marks discussed with you here today as to whether under this relevant state law, the law provided for the continuance on of criminal prosecutions which had been brought prior to dissolution after the dissolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.814" offset="5282670">And the court below, for reasons which we think are correct and which I'll go into briefly, decided that under the Delaware and Maryland laws, these criminal prosecutions which had been began prior to dissolution did continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.324" offset="5360619">But we do not think, if it will please the Court, that it is necessary or even advisable to rest the decision on these grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.282" offset="5416521">Because as we shall argue in our alternative ground which we take very seriously, Your Honor, under Section 8 of the Sherman Act -- excuse me, under Section 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, any person who violates the law is guilty of a criminal act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.756" offset="5506382">Now, Section 8 of the Sherman Act, defines the term person there and it defines it as including any corporation existing under or authorized by the laws of any state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.565" offset="5569599">Therefore, we suggest that you don't have to determine whether Maryland law or Delaware law or the laws of all 48 other states because this would all come up in other states from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.634" offset="5633860">You don't have to determine whether those laws provide the state could continue to prosecute a criminal action after dissolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.938" offset="5679104">All you have to do under the plain language of Section 8 of the Sherman Act is to determine whether the corporation is in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.674" offset="5722049">And we suggest that this is a very advantageous ground upon which this court might wish to raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.152" offset="5768025">This case is an important one because it involves Delaware because obviously a large percentage of the corporations involved in interstate commerce are Delaware corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.060" offset="5811597">But if you decide this case by upholding the court below and we think that their position is perfectly sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.215" offset="5844198">But if you'll limit yourself to the position that the court below took, then inevitably because of the difference in languages of the other statutes either other lower courts or eventually this Court is going to be called upon to decide whether the language in Delaware is or is not applicable to the language in New Jersey, New York, Texas or California or what have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.377" offset="5940851">And the lower court cases cited in the briefs which do in fact go off on to analysis of other state laws as well show you that you're going to have 48 positions instead of one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.502" offset="6001351">Now, very briefly, we think it clear that the value of corporate criminal liability isn't up for question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.303" offset="6060596">Their course or interest in legal or philosophical arguments that can be made as to what -- how a corporation can or cannot be criminally liable for anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.251" offset="6112423">But it certainly well settled by this time that corporate criminal liability particularly under the Sherman Act is one of the important and effective deterrents on violation of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.359" offset="6168848">And this is true even though it is also true as Judge Marks stated that the individual corporate officials are also liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.900" offset="6219003">And it's true, as the cases have held despite the fact that a parent corporation has in this case, may also be liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.619" offset="6261844">On the other hand, it seems to me also clear that if by voluntary dissolution and that's what happened in this case and in most of the other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.300" offset="6304580">If by voluntary dissolution a cooperation which has been indicted or is about to be indicted can evade its criminal responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.865" offset="6346794">But to that extent of it, a fairly significant extent, the basic sanctions which Congress intends to keep the Sherman Act from being violated have been limited.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="1575.300" offset="6404577">Is there any suggestion in this case that the dissolution was for the purpose of escaping the fine?</text>

          <turn speaker="richard_a_solomon" startTime="1581.170" stopTime="1991.124">
            <label>Mr. Richard A. Solomon</label>
            <text syncTime="1581.170" offset="6428087">No, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.545" offset="6429550">There's no suggestion in this case and it may very well be as they argue in this case and as they have argued in other cases that the dissolution isn't directly or indirectly related to escaping fines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.996" offset="6487333">However, I suggest, Your Honor, we've cited on page 11 of our brief in a footnote there some 10 or 11 cases in recent years where dissolution has suddenly taken place either immediately before or immediately after in a criminal indictment under the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.096" offset="6575731">We suggest that the problem is likely to become more serious because Congress just recently has raised the maximum find from $5000 to $50,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.834" offset="6618676">And we also suggest, Your Honor that assuming that a corporation dissolves for reasons of its own, we do not know of any reason, policy wise certainly, why the business judgment to dissolve for other reason should carry with it an exemption from the criminal liability for acts they have already committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.840" offset="6730689">Now, again, briefly, I don't think I have to take much time with respect to the argument that's made at some extent with the briefs with respect to debt of a corporation being analogist to death of an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.511" offset="6793383">This was a valid concept in the 18th century when corporations -- when they were dissolved did die completely and no further actions of any sort are possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.309" offset="6848658">But as the modern business corporation evolved in the 19th century was obvious that this was not in appropriate concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.131" offset="6883871">And therefore, over a period of time starting I think about 1819 in Massachusetts, all of the states have developed special statutory provisions which keep the corporation in effect for certain purposes after it is dissolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.120" offset="6979897">Normally, the corporation can wind up its business, can sue and be sued and as one court has said in a quotation cited in our brief, in effect do everything necessary to wind up its affairs other than carrying on the business it was originally incorporated for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.611" offset="7073834">According to this court and all other courts while I occasionally have referred to the old common law rule and occasionally have mentioned that under the common law, a corporation was dead and it was dead, have recognized that dissolution is not the death of the corporation and if any analogy is correct, I should think it would probably would be that dissolution is a retirement, a force retirement of a corporation which you can't continue in business but he's going to be liable for what's happened prior to his retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.913" offset="7211029">Now, because statute had taken the place of the common law concepts which are out of date here, this Court has held that what must be done when the question comes up as to the extent to which a corporation exist after dissolution is look at the relevant law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.766" offset="7310399">Now, this relevant law starts out of course with Section 8 of the Sherman Act, which says that a corporation is liable criminally if it exist under the laws of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.049" offset="7363584">While some of the judges of the lower court level have in dictum suggested that the Government's alternative position is a sound one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.785" offset="7406529">I'll make it fair to say that all of the decisions today have gone on analysis of whether state law provides for continuance of criminal liability after dissolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.103" offset="7471835">And the court below here found that both the Delaware law and the Maryland law did provide for continuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.036" offset="7515512">But we turn briefly to the Delaware law, and I'll turn to this first because the conflict of the circuits which I presume is the reason why this Court is listening to this case, arises with respect to Delaware law, there's no conflict with respect to Maryland law, there are only two cases with respect to Maryland law, both cited in our brief and both cases the courts have found that Maryland law does not abate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.024" offset="7623450">The court -- under Maryland law a criminal action is not abated by dissolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.351" offset="7644766">But let's look at Delaware law upon which there is a split in the Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.830" offset="7670680">Now, the crucial section of the Delaware law is the Section 278 which Judge Marks read to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.068" offset="7707669">And in our view, the crucial aspect of this Section is the second sentence thereof which reads with respect to any action, suit or proceeding began before the corporation is dissolved or within a three-year period after it is dissolve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.948" offset="7787186">That action shall continue in force until any judgments orders or decrees therein shall be fully executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.259" offset="7832430">Now, that's a fairly broad language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.775" offset="7842461">It doesn't say with respect to any civil action suit or proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.822" offset="7866702">It doesn't use the word suit which has been alone, which has been the subject of conflicting decisions in lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.371" offset="7896900">It doesn't say with respect to any action, suit or proceeding except a criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.040" offset="7923545">It uses the broadest possible language which respect to any action, suit or proceeding and therefore the court below has held that -- that language given the normal meaning, particularly the word proceeding has always been given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.557" offset="7989582">Thus, include criminal proceedings and that therefore where you have a criminal proceeding started before dissolution or within a three-year period thereafter, you have liability continuing until that suit is decided.</text>

            <text syncTime="2132.483" offset="8633344">I think there's only one real problem about the second ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.303" offset="8652570">As far back as the Northern Securities case, this Court indicated that states by their corporate laws cannot immunize corporations from the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.727" offset="8698232">In other words, starting with Northern Security, it's quite clear that Delaware could not have established a corporation and said this corporation shall have X, Y, Z functions but one of the functions it will not have is being liable to federal criminal suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.709" offset="8766255">Now, that's Northern Securities that's one with the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2172.591" offset="8793736">I think a nearer -- a more nearly accurate application -- the application you're making with Northern Securities is that what many state statutes corporate -- corporation laws have said, it has functions and policy A, C and D and it can't consolidate with another railroad at the common railroad corporate statute and nothing the Delaware could do and could disable that would foreclose the government of the United States said in fact to Northern Pacific and the Union Pacific did apply and therefore -- I mean a question of violating the Sherman law, the question of fact in such a case did consolidate having engaged or did get together etcetera, etcetera.</text>

            <text syncTime="2223.163" offset="8996028">Well, Your Honor's difficulty in finding the difficulty with this case is our difficulty too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.342" offset="9016717">As far as I can see, the only grounds that the petitioners have for disputing our ultimate position is some of the language of this Court in the Chicago Title and Trust Company case appearing at 302 U.S. 120 .</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.682" offset="9094144">Now, in that case, what had happened was that Illinois Corporation had been dissolved by the State of Illinois for failure to comply with the Illinois law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.676" offset="9146075">And two years after or more than two years afterwards, after the time when under Illinois law of this dissolved corporation could sue or be sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.158" offset="9184005">At that subsequent period, some new people got in control of this dissolved corporation and they attempted to utilize Section 77 (b) of the Bankruptcy Act to reorganize the corporation and the question that the court passed upon in the Chicago Title and Trust Company case was whether that was appropriate, whether the corporation was dead or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.373" offset="9300825">And the majority of this Court in that case in an opinion by Judge (Inaudible) did find that after the time had expired under the Illinois law for dissolved corporation to sue or be sued, that the corporation could not voluntarily go in to the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.383" offset="9392880">There was a dissenting opinion which was written by Judge Cardozo and I think concurred in by Judge Stone -- Justice Stone and Justice Black which indicated that in their opinion there was still a sufficient spark of life even though the corporation could not be sued or sue, even though the two-year period after dissolution have expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.976" offset="9499251">Who are this people to take advantage of the Bankruptcy Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.444" offset="9513148">But my friends argue, that since the disposition of Justice Cardozo was not adopted by the majority of the Supreme Court were stopped from arguing what they call our ultimate position which I would like to make our major position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.113" offset="9591829">Well, I don't think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.420" offset="9597053">I think the Chicago Title Company case at most when you read it through, indicates an unwillingness on the part of the majority to allow a corporation which have been dissolved for malfeasance of its own to voluntarily take advantage of the federal law after the period for which it could do anything under the state law had expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.677" offset="9706036">And whether you agree with the majority or the minority position there, I suggest that is not this case where the problem is on the contrary whether criminal actions under the Sherman Act commenced prior to the dissolution of this corporation should be abated by the voluntary action of the corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3114.715" offset="12562265">Yes, in this whole book which includes the Rules of Civil Procedure and otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.079" offset="12587656">Now, I'd like to say one other thing about Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.653" offset="12601971">The Delaware statute was construed in the Safeway case in 1944 and I may say that I have the privilege of arguing before the same court a companion case the Kroger case which was not reported except as a memorandum in which the same question was involved and the same decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.313" offset="12672606">That was 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.852" offset="12678771">It's a long time since then and Delaware is quite cognizant to how its laws had been construed and it's made no change in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.379" offset="12708864">So presumably, they did not feel that any change was necessary by reason of the decision of the Tenth Circuit in several cases that criminal cases did not survive under the Delaware law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.163" offset="12783992">Now, I want to talk about this alternative ground for a moment which counsel designates himself as the alternative ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.054" offset="12823594">I think so designating which is fairly with the secondary ground which now says, it's a major ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.587" offset="12849716">Well, the difficulty it seems to us at least is that (Inaudible) the so-called spark of life theory which was found in this famous case of the Chicago Title and Trust Company against the Wilcox Building Corporation, 302 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.411" offset="12948982">In that case as counsel has properly said, there was an Illinois corporation which was dissolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.619" offset="12977821">There it was dissolved because of its own misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.432" offset="12993076">Corporations can be dissolved because of the limitation on their existence, they can be dissolved by voluntary act, they can be dissolved by failure to pay their taxes and having an action brought against them or against by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.187" offset="13044172">Here, this corporation was dissolved but under Illinois law it could continue for certain purposes and the Federal Bankruptcy Act said, that any corporation could avail itself a bankruptcy and so this corporation which had a spark of life, I use that word because that's the word in the Court's own opinion, was taken over by some other stockholders not the stockholders who were guilty and they filed an action in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.687" offset="13174157">And the question was, does that corporation exist and can it avail itself of the federal law which says any corporation which exists may take the step.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.593" offset="13225775">And here's what the majority of the Court said, “How long and upon what terms a State created corporation may continue to exist as a matter exclusively of state power?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.991" offset="13275303">I won't read it all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.630" offset="13281886">It hardly will be claimed that the federal government may breathe life into a corporate entity thus put to death for the state in a lawful exercise of its sovereign power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.705" offset="13326190">The power to take the long step of putting an end to the court with existence of a state created corporation without limitation, connotes the power to take the shorter one of putting an end to it which such limitations as the legislature sees fit to enact.</text>

            <text syncTime="3342.152" offset="13471953">But if he -- if a corporation has legal capacity for certain purposes, you don't suggest that Congress couldn't say, so long as you have legal capacity to some purposes, you must continue liable for what you did while you have a full capacity.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard A. Solomon</label>
            <text syncTime="3379.106" offset="13619806">But they say that the state has put it and since the federal government's power is to resurrect a corporation which a state has put out of existence for all purposes, the conclusion seems inevitable that if the state attaches qualifications to its sentence of extinction nothing can been added or taken from these qualifications by federal authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.266" offset="13712488">Now, I think that is the court's answer to Your Honor's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.281" offset="13736521">Now, going on from that, I may say that there were two or three members of the court who disagree and filed their able dissenting opinions, I confess that when I read the majority and sometimes the dissents that -- I'm glad I'm not a member of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.388" offset="13808933">It has to decide between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.642" offset="13817919">But nevertheless I take the law as it's finally declared by this Court and never departed from since that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.460" offset="13853236">Now, counsel says that we're going back to the 18th century to say that the death of a corporation maybe pointed to the death of an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.287" offset="13912482">But I happen to have been a member of a court where Chief Justice pass on to get his judicial career and I have a high respect for Chief Justice Taft's opinions and I don't think they're an acronyms of the 18th century.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.410" offset="13969011">Speaking for this Court, he said, in Oklahoma Natural Gas Company against Oklahoma which is cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.202" offset="14024182">There is no specific provision in our rules for the substitution of the party litigant of a successor to a dissolved corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.418" offset="14057096">It is well settled that a common law and in the federal jurisdiction, a corporation who has been dissolved as if it did not exist and resulted in a dissolution cannot be distinguished from the death of a natural person in its effect.Citing cases and going on and completing the equation because of time limitations, I will not read anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.743" offset="14154376">The Court asked and counsel properly replied, this corporation did not endeavor these corporations which were dissolved, did not endeavor to evade any responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.575" offset="14193664">It was somewhat of a coincidence if the solution occurred at the time that it was predetermined as the affidavit shows here by an endeavor to comply with the Federal Trade Commission rule which rule that there should not be separate selling companies but there should be one selling company, and therefore these corporations were dissolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.435" offset="14289063">When they say that action is -- or suit is enlarged by the word proceeding because we have the rules of criminal procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.863" offset="14342875">I want to call Your Honors attention to the fact that wherever you find the word procedure being used as meaning something criminal, it's always proceeded by the word criminal procedure, criminal procedure and that's to be found if you just open their own brief and read it every time they quote where it says proceeding and means criminal, it says criminal proceeding and nowhere have either of these states ever used that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.643" offset="14465964">Now, as far as the Addy case is concerned which he speaks of a showing light on this situation, in the Addy case, a dissolved corporation became the reverter under a deed whereby it was provided that if the Government, I think, failed to use certain land as a life saving station, it reverted to the corporation which gave it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.886" offset="14570872">And so they said, “Yes” under the very language of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.368" offset="14604831">They can -- they have a sufficient spark of life to get their property back and distribute it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.985" offset="14631267">That's the -- it's a winding up process the same as the executors or administrators of a dead man's estate would get a reverter.</text>
