            <label>Mr. William C. Wines</label>
            <text syncTime="19.110" offset="180830">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.115" offset="188876">Your Honors, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois with a three-judge bench has held unconstitutional and enjoined the enforcement of an Illinois statute requiring the equipment of trucks and trailers travelling over Illinois highways with contour type mudguards meeting specifications enacted by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.685" offset="335161">The Court held only that the requirements of the statute imposed an unreasonable burden upon interstate commerce and enjoined the effect of the act with respect to that commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.530" offset="414469">In two other cases cited in the brief, Rudolph Express Company case and a later case, the Supreme Court of Illinois has held the instant measure reasonable and not violative of due process on the ground of its unreasonable character.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.183" offset="525124">Your Honors have noted probable jurisdiction and the cause is here on direct appeal from the District Court for the Southern District of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.802" offset="583638">The District Court has summarized the requirements of the statute and with the Chief Justice's permission, I should like to quote that summary since its precise terms are important and I am reading from page 6 of appellant's brief which quotes the language of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.604" offset="718848">Specifications, the Court says, require that the splash guards, one, contour under the wheel, two, cover the top 90 degrees of the rear 180 degrees with an exception of vehicles of less than five inches counts from requiring a contour within 10 inches of the body.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.284" offset="797529">So they extend down within 10 inches of the ground that they have a lip or plunge of two inches upon the outside and retain general parallel condition under all operating conditions remotely required by the statute not more than six inches from the truck when fully loaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.346" offset="889793">The District Court premised its conclusion of unreasonable violation -- unreasonable burdening of interstate commerce upon that Court's finding that no other State has a similar requirement that Arkansas has a recent administrative regulation requiring a flap or -- or apron type mudguard which is in conflict with the Illinois type of mudguard upon a finding that it would unreasonably burden interstate commerce to equip entering vehicles with this mudguard when they're not required in other States and upon a declaration that -- based on conflicting evidence we say that there is some danger that this contour type of mudguard is likely to fall off and create a hazard to oncoming traffic in other lanes.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.330" offset="1209741">It is the respectful but honest position of the Attorney General that the major -- major stricken down by the District Court embodies and enacts a reasonable exercise of Illinois' police power over her highways and with respect to vehicles moving within her borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.055" offset="1320605">The District Court's opinion does not, in the findings, do not make mention of the evidence which I believe I can say is undisputed in the record that a contour splash guard that is the type required by the Illinois law unlike a flap or apron type mudguard will throw debris down instead of out.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.104" offset="1436797">There is a testimony in the record that the contour type of mudguard provided by the Illinois statute does cause debris to be thrown down.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.055" offset="1488624">The evidence shows that to plan an appreciating vehicle is equipped with inadequate mudguards, those mudguards don't prevent debris from flying into the -- a windshield of a following vehicle and that the driver of the following vehicle tends to lose control of this car.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.731" offset="1611295">It tends to go off the road and accidents ensue.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.958" offset="1636268">Now, it's significant that counsel for the plaintiffs don't cite a single decision of this Court and our own research indicate that they can't cite a decision of this Court in which this Court has ever stricken down a state law fixing the requirements for vehicles traveling upon state constructed highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.199" offset="1761238">I mean automotive vehicles.</text>

            <text syncTime="620.095" offset="2584827">Now, the interesting area of focus prompted by Your Honor's suggestion is this as this Court has many times declared.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.284" offset="2645535">It isn't enough that a measure be fairly debatable if it's within the arena of debate as to its reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.045" offset="2684615">It's a matter for the state legislature in the case of a state act or Congress in the act in case of a federal act.</text>

            <text syncTime="723.541" offset="2998606">The law applies not only to tractor -- trucks but to trailers that are attest to tractors and many times a tractor will start out with one trailer and the trailer will be shifted around to another tractor just as freight cars are shunted from one line to another in interstate commerce so that there is -- there is no doubt to the burden imposed upon these trailers and trucks that come in a substantial one but our evidence shows, I think I can say without dispute, that this type of mudguard can be installed by a man having no previous experience in about an hour and it can be installed for about, I believe certain hours.</text>
