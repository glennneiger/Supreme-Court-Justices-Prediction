          <heading>Argument of Harry E. Wilmarth</heading>
          <turn speaker="harry_e_wilmarth" startTime="0.000" stopTime="212.733">
            <label>Mr. Harry E. Wilmarth</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">-- the point which I was addressing myself -- the agreement itself, in and of itself didn't become applicable to the craft as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.902" offset="159013">Now that point is made clear at the bottom of page 3 of the appendix, the last few lines in which it says that “no agreement made pursuant to subparagraph (b)” which is the check off paragraph, “shall provide for deductions and payments to the union of dues other than that in which he holds membership.”</text>
            <text syncTime="35.408" offset="245008">Now that particular section is important because it's involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.404" offset="264965">In this case, the employee had terminated his membership in the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.909" offset="290983">The union in the carrier insisted, however, that unless he followed certain conditions in the collective agreement, they would continue to deduct dues and pay them over to the union even though he had terminated his membership, which we claim is invalid under the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.262" offset="368410">Now in addition on page 4 as a last proviso guarantees to the employee that he may change membership from one union to another, and that nothing in the act or in the agreement shall prevent him from having that right of change.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.175" offset="460048">At the top of page 3 of the appendix, we would like to emphasis this fact; a head of the proviso, that is section b of 11, which begins at the bottom of page 2 and the top of page 3, “a head of the proviso deals with action between the carrier and the union.”</text>
            <text syncTime="112.664" offset="553984">In other words, the carrier and the union are permitted and authorized to sit down and negotiate a check off agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.718" offset="586271">The proviso, however, doesn't deal with any action by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.213" offset="604244">It deals with action as between the individual employee and the carrier in a sense it's so directly involved in this case, I will read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.391" offset="656906">The proviso provides, “provided that no such agreement shall be effective with respect to any individual employee until he shall have furnished the employer with a written assignment to the labor organization of such membership dues, initiation fees and assessments which shall be revocable in writing after the expiration of one year.”</text>
            <text syncTime="164.328" offset="760665">And the point that I am emphasizing is that the -- that the act doesn't authorize the union to negotiate in the check off agreement anything regarding the authorization that the employee signs to make a check off agreement effective to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.786" offset="842480">That is he signs the authorization, he files it with his employer, he is guaranteed the right to revoke it in writing after one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.198" offset="884172">Now in our brief, we have set forth, in addition to emphasizing these points, some of the legislative history of this act with particular reference to the proviso.</text>

            <text syncTime="228.605" offset="1017814">Well in our judgment Mr. Justice they would have had to promptly discontinue dues deductions.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.737" offset="1058356">Since you've asked the question, I will say at this point, in the lower courts and in the Court of Appeals and up to the time of this Court, the respondents took the position that they would not recognize his revocation unless he did it according to the agreement or conditions imposed and that they would continue to deduct the dues even though he had terminated his membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.578" offset="1169638">Now for the first time in this Court they have changed that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.335" offset="1184684">I was going to advert to it later.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.399" offset="1192939">They now say that if he had sent a letter to the carrier advising the carrier that he had terminated his membership, they would have stopped dues deductions immediately or respectively (Inaudible)</text>

            <label>Mr. Harry E. Wilmarth</label>
            <text syncTime="287.307" offset="1252603">Very well, he submitted a revocation in writing in the exact form provided by the dues deduction agreement, sent that form both to the carrier and the union saying I revoke my dues deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.140" offset="1347897">The carrier at first recognized that it's valid and transmitted to the union to be noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.320" offset="1376632">The union however stated that it did not comply with the provisions of the dues deduction agreement, that the form that he had submitted had not been printed by the union and that he must come to the union, obtain a form that has been printed by it and submit that form.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.456" offset="1461164">The union -- the agreement itself appears at page 74 of the record, the first paragraph just states that it's a check off relating to members, paragraph B states that the signed authorization maybe revoked in writing at any time after the expiration of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.945" offset="1607137">At the end of the agreement, there are forms set forth both for authorization and for revocation and in this case we have not challenged the forms themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.573" offset="1669622">It's not before the court, probably the man could write a letter in unequivocal terms and obtain the same result, but he did file the forms and that's undisputed.</text>

            <text syncTime="449.574" offset="1901693">And on page 75 they pointed to the provision in the agreement that said both the authorization forms and the revocation of authorization forms shall be reproduced and furnished as necessary by the organization without cost to the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.117" offset="1971806">And they pointed that the language reproduced and furnished and said this is a form that wasn't reproduced and furnished by the organization.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harry E. Wilmarth</label>
            <text syncTime="511.348" offset="2148812">Yes and I will come to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.394" offset="2176920">They argued to the Trial Court although there was nothing in the record, it was an argument of statutory construction rather than any record support that their reason for asking him to take a form printed by the union and coming to the union and asking it for the form was it would help them in book keeping procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.768" offset="2274408">Now it sir, no one has ever explained just what book keeping procedures would be helped by them having the form in front of them which he did send them to the carrier and him coming first and getting a form printed by them and then submitting the same form.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.259" offset="2348387">On page 11 of their brief to this Court they give what we deem the real significance of the provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.469" offset="2393213">And they are referring this on the first full paragraph of page 11 of the respondent's brief of the BRT, the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, the yellow brief, referring to this requirement C which we've just read they say if this requirement is held invalid, it will remove the lock from the door and leave the house wide open for ransack.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.323" offset="2496658">Sometimes as a practical matter as well as -- sometimes as a practical matter an employee needs protection against himself, as well as from outside undue influence.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.955" offset="2555173">And the procedure set up in the agreement in question affords that protection by requiring both the authorization and revocation deduction to be made in writing on the proper form.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.778" offset="2606477">Now it's obvious this man is a conductor, he works in the craft of conductors, of course he can work in either craft.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.568" offset="2641690">The Order of Railway Conductors represents the conductor craft's and the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen represents the craft of trainmen or brakemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.768" offset="2682441">At the time, however, he was a conductor.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.132" offset="2695920">He had terminated membership in this union.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.373" offset="2712848">There will be a psychological factor if nothing more against a man when he sends in a revocation in writing if he has to go and ask the union for the grace of furnishing of some form which they have printed and their statement as to what it really intents that they will be enabled to furnish him protection against himself.</text>

            <text syncTime="687.106" offset="2851819">I assume the very statement as they put it, protection against himself, might indicate more.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.578" offset="2885674">In this record there is this fact of record while Mr. Felter was furnished the forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.227" offset="2908244">I suppose Mr. Felter as a railroad man who is and will be all his life has an interest in knowing whether the next one he signs will have a lock on the door stronger than this lock.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.221" offset="2960280">In this particular record, he brought this action for himself and others similarly situated, there were approximately two dozen which he listed similarly situated who had sent him revocations as he had.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.541" offset="3021511">Before the case was over, some half dozen or so of them, not denying that they had set in the revocations, however came in and executed letters to the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen that they had never been contacted as part of this case, didn't want to be a part of it and wanted to keep their membership in the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.712" offset="3122239">Now I assume they received some of the protection against themselves which cost them because they didn't deny it at point that they had originally sent in revocations or their dues deductions.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.532" offset="3169468">They just said we weren't contacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.402" offset="3176991">We don't want to be a part of this lawsuit, and we want to remain part of the trainmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.097" offset="3203741">I think the realities of the fact that the statute recognized -- Congress recognized that if carriers and unions could sit down and negotiate check on agreements, both of the parties might have reasons which would be inimical to the individual man.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.928" offset="3291094">In this sense the union of course seeks self perpetuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.191" offset="3308126">The carrier may seek to favor one union over another, so that if the two of them can sit down and as they say here in their brief, negotiate a lock on the door, which -- then the man's freedom of choice guaranteed doing the act is to that extent effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.675" offset="3398092">Now whether it is here severe or whether it's slight, it's to some degree effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.421" offset="3441037">We say that the act, its legislative history all are directed to one thing, the man shall have free exercise of choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.613" offset="3493804">Even as a member of the union he is granted that, he can choose or not to choose to come under the check off agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.413" offset="3537063">He is guaranteed the right to revoke it in writing and in the legislative history in the debates before the committees, it was said that if at the end of year he doesn't like it, he can revoke it in writing, that's his discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.280" offset="3612505">So that when they negotiate we say that the act in the proviso relates only his choice alone and that there is no authorization and in fact it's prohibited to negotiate any form of restriction on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.015" offset="3679483">Now the Trial Court and the Court of Appeals affirming it thought that you could imply that you could negotiate reasonable restrictions on his right of revocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.682" offset="3742072">Well, that means this then if they can negotiate reasonable or unreasonable restriction, then each case will stand by itself if there are -- you'll have to come to court to find out whether they're reasonable or unreasonable lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.436" offset="3805080">We say they were prohibited and to that extent, this agreement which endeavored to negotiate some type of restrictions violated the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.596" offset="3857742">Now we also of course I remember of opinions under the comparable provision of the National Labor Relations Act which have struck down any attempt by unions to -- and we'll urge on the specific terms that act with reference to the mans' right to comply with check off or union shop agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.738" offset="3982294">In other words, the terms of the act had been strictly construed in one they have tried to enlarge them in any way they have been struck down.</text>

            <text syncTime="1769.908" offset="7183026">The dues deduction arrangement came in affect, the men voted in a referendum they wanted dues deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.368" offset="7216880">So then the Brotherhood representatives got together with the carrier and they said how are we going to go about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.327" offset="7244675">Well the man had to be a member before he could have dues deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.853" offset="7262751">So he paid his membership let's say this thing started here in these letters March 30, so he paid his membership for the month of April and he was paid up then for the month of April out of his own pocket, but in order to make dues deduction effective, the company pointed out to the -- to the Brotherhood and the Brotherhood had to readily agree, well the dues deduction then has to be for the next month, that's what they ignore and where they get this whole thing haywire and not looking at the time element.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.904" offset="7399006">And they try to make it look as if we are collecting for money after the man had passed out of the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.674" offset="7430040">From the very start to dues had to be deducted and the arrangement was and it's right in the agreement that was executed between the Brotherhood and the Railroad under which this man himself subscribed and it read and admittedly read and knew all about and agreed to that in the first two weeks of this first month, he pays for the first month and then on the first two weeks of the month where he is already paid, the dues are deducted for the following month which starts this thing going.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.080" offset="7571728">So you've got the man paid up for two months to start with and then you just continue along with that and when he finally gets out he is still paid up after he submits his resignation for another month.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.847" offset="7622719">And of course that I don't know any these organizations that don't recognize that a man is a member while he is paid up, the issue arises when he ceases to be paid up as to whether he is a member and he didn't ask for any refund, and so the whole thing revolves around a very simple proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.046" offset="7699519">There has to be time limits to something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.639" offset="7709968">The brotherhood and the railroad get together and they say, how are we going to handle this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.802" offset="7730552">I don't know how the other side had set it up, because there -- you got a railroad spread out over several thousand miles, it's a thousand miles from San Francisco to El Paso and if these dues are sent in by a treasurer in El Paso, it takes several days to get to the railroad and it takes several days for the railroad to make up its payroll, so they worked it out on this instance, this happened to be in Eugene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.044" offset="7827519">And in Eugene which is about 200 odd miles from Portland, it was worked out that the secretary would submit the list to the railroad on the 3rd date, send his list in on the 3rd of the month, the railroad had to get the list by the 5th, the railroad made the deduction by the 15th which gave everybody a timely method of going about this arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.788" offset="7942562">Then by the 15th the dues were deducted for the following month.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.044" offset="7971506">The man was always being paid up for the current month because he is paid up to start with, this is where all that confusion arises.</text>

            <text syncTime="3559.424" offset="14341099">Now is that denying this man right to terminate when it's admitted that no question was put on him when he was offered an authentic card to sign, when the brotherhood has the responsibility of seeing to it that this thing is properly administered, that the money is sent and this treasury has the responsibility and this man himself in two different places has agreed to this, and it's read to him when he understands it.</text>
