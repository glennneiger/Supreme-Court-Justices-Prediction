            <label>Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="35.584" offset="245739">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.209" offset="256188">This case comes here to review the judgment of the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals affirming petitioner sentence of fine and imprisonment for refusing to answer certain questions put to him by a Racial Activities Investigating Committee of the Virginia legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.675" offset="346049">It is petitioner's contention before Your Honors today as it has been throughout these proceedings that the action of the Virginia Racial Activities Investigating Committee in summoning and questioning petitioner about his association with various civic, political and religious organizations unlawfully infringed upon his constitutional right of freedom of speech and of assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.357" offset="480841">This is, I believe, the first case to come before this Court involving the infringement of these constitutional rights by an Investigating Committee in the area of racial activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.285" offset="544475">The Court did of course at the last term consider a somewhat similar effort to harass the supporters of desegregation in the NAACP case.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.911" offset="587003">And of course, the Court has considered the activities of investigating committees in the so-called anti-communist appeal as the last and the next cases will be, but I believe that the first of its type which involved an infringement based on a Racial Activities Investigating Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.777" offset="682506">And it is our confident belief and it will be our purpose to show that petitioner's case is then a fortiori case on the basis of NAACP last year in Watkins and Sweezy before them.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.526" offset="753455">To fully understand the massive intrusion on fundamental liberties involved in this case, a small part at least of the background of the resolutions setting up the Investigating Committee must be briefly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.481" offset="813328">On February 1st, 1956, approximately or almost two years after this Court's decision in the Brown case, the Virginia General Assembly adopted an interposition resolution interposing the will of Virginia against the decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.871" offset="898905">On August 27, 1956, some six months later, in an implementation of that interposition resolution, an extra session of the Virginia legislature met.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.510" offset="961390">The Governor in opening the Virginia legislature's extra session submitted what he called, and I quote “Recommendations to continue our system of segregated public schools”.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.450" offset="1025128">And on September 29th, 1956, this extra session of the general assembly adapted more than a dozen bills to carry out the Governor's recommendation to continue our system of segregated public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.952" offset="1099212">This was what is colloquially and commonly known Virginia's plan of massive resistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.197" offset="1128155">And it had two facets, these dozen or more bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.757" offset="1150412">First, was the direct assault on this Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.711" offset="1170265">That was the provision to close the school if any Negro were definitely assigned to a then white school.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.390" offset="1204955">It was a Pupil Placement Act which was declared on constitutional by the Fourth Circuit and Third was denied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.684" offset="1234108">It was the Appropriations Act which finally and also indicated Virginia's massive resistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.444" offset="1265142">There were about seven or eight statutes in this area directly contravening the decision of this Court, but that was not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.721" offset="1310281">In addition to the direct assault on the decisions of this Court, there came what I would refer to as the indirect assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.447" offset="1349151">In seven statutes aimed at those who would bring lawsuits to enforce the rights which this Court indicated in Brown v. Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.058" offset="1407561">These were the seven so-called anti-NAACP bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.728" offset="1430235">Two of these were registration provisions which were declared unconstitutional by a three-judge statutory court, and which is before Your Honors in number 127.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.661" offset="1482062">Three of these were anti -- so-called anti-barratry statutes, one of which was declared unconstitutional in the three-judge court in number 127 and two of which -- and the remaining two were not passed on because it was left for the state court to clarify what these three-judge federal statutory court thought was ambiguous.</text>

            <text syncTime="368.686" offset="1578088">It is number -- I think it's here, Harrison v. NAACP, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.617" offset="1601808">And finally, the last two statutes are investigating committee statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.293" offset="1624586">That is the final two of the seven indirect assaults on this Court's decision where investigating -- the Investigating Committee wasn't enough to pass one investigating resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.207" offset="1684250">The Virginia legislature on the same day they passed this other dozen bills passed too.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.069" offset="1707656">One of those was here in number 84 and was declared loose because it had expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.219" offset="1732211">The other is here today in Mr. Scull's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.107" offset="1747780">These investigating committees overlapped.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.056" offset="1763558">There is no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.520" offset="1769409">The record is clear on the overlap at page 26 to 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.363" offset="1788844">But in addition to their overlap, if Your Honors please, this is the first time in Virginia history that any legislative committee was given a subpoena power and the right to operate outside of the regular session.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.102" offset="1851747">This was all part and parcel of massive resistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.014" offset="1871391">So much as to how -- how we got on the books resolution that is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.744" offset="1902320">The resolution itself is contained in full at page 4 of petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.904" offset="1930951">The Committee called the Committee on Law Reform in Racial Activity is also known as the Thomson Committee for its Chairman.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.629" offset="1965850">The Committee is authorized in Section 2 to make a thorough investigation of the activities of organizations seeking to influence, encourage, or promote litigation relating to racial activities in this State.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.328" offset="2032724">The Committee shall conduct its investigation so as to collect evidence and information.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.665" offset="2058010">And then I dropped one and two because the Committee Chairman, as I will come to, dropped one and two, and go to three to collect information determining the effect which integration or the threat of integration could have on the operation of the public schools in the State or the general welfare of the State and whether the loss of barratry, champerty, and maintenance are being violated in connection therewith.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.821" offset="2162604">That is the resolution before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.501" offset="2173367">Now, as to what happens under.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.932" offset="2183084">On September 20, 1957, Mr. Scull, the petitioner was called before this Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.154" offset="2212028">In view of the Watkins and Sweezy cases, his counsel Wisely, he was another counsel, counsel Wisely suggested that he asked the Committee what the question under inquiry was.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.374" offset="2272841">At page 73 of the record, you will find that the Committee Chairman responded by stating what was in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.567" offset="2305651">It's on the middle of page 73.</text>

            <text syncTime="555.238" offset="2324355">73, Your Honor, right in the middle there Chairman Thomson states what the question under inquiry is by repeating the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.302" offset="2368554">Then Mr. Scull has asked, “Do you belong to the Fairfax County Council on Human Relation a distinguished body?”</text>
            <text syncTime="580.430" offset="2425083">And on page 74 and 75, he gives his answer which is a statement he had prepared indicating the he supported the decisions of this Court and he had a right of free speech and a free assembly to speak for the decisions of this Court and to assemble with others who felt likewise and he would not answer these questions because they infringed his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.327" offset="2536678">He was then asked 30 other questions making a total of 31 to all of which answers he gave the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.230" offset="2580250">Now, the questions -- 20 of the questions involved did -- this organization or that organization or this person or that person use your box, your mailbox.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.347" offset="2640750">The rest of the questions were associations with organizations and whether he had contributed funds for our organizational support of these cases that were in the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.836" offset="2698742">Despite the fact that no answer was ever given to Mr. Scull's statement, the Committee went to the Arlington Circuit Court and asked for an order directing Mr. Scull to answer all of the 31 questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.769" offset="2790484">We had a hearing in October 15th, I was at this hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.915" offset="2811068">We had a hearing on October 15th before the Circuit Court of Arlington County to determine whether Mr. Scull should be ordered to answer these 31 questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.460" offset="2857253">The only witness was Mr. Thompson, the Chairman of the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.506" offset="2881390">All he did was to say here is the record and then I was allowed to cross-examine and these six things came out during the course of the cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.229" offset="2924335">First that the Committee had no rule, second, that Mr. Scull had been called because of a brochure entitled “The Shocking Truth” which is an anonymous brochure about which the Committee knew nothing and which is on page 84 of the record but it's hard to handle it, we do not tear it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.708" offset="3010226">I've torn my own out because it was very hard to work with.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.149" offset="3035930">Third, Mr. Thompson stated that his investigation was being used because it was devastating to the NAACP would bust that organization wide open and would keep the NAACP out of litigation which was the heart of the organization.</text>

            <text syncTime="801.770" offset="3310425">This was their answer to the claim of fairness was that they had investigated both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.638" offset="3329964">It was like a horse and a rabbit.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.551" offset="3337592">It was 100 people on the one side and one on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.609" offset="3357759">Then if, Your Honor please -- if Your Honor, please the -- Mr. Thomson supports rightly and confirm the fact that he is the leading supporter of segregated schools and opponent of this Court's decisions in his area.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.804" offset="3426617">And finally at the sixth, we went in to the question under inquiry and Mr. Thomson was -- and I will develop this at further length in the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.276" offset="3468518">Mr. Thomson was unable in anyway to state a question under inquiry in any definitive form.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.723" offset="3510314">Despite this and despite that failure of counsel for the Committee ever to make a suggested distinction of this Court's decision in Watkins and Sweezy, the Court ordered Mr. Scull to answer the 31 questions before the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.897" offset="3594951">Mr. Scull in fact before the Committee on October 23rd had respectfully declined to answer on his statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.237" offset="3628283">On October 30, 1957, there was a trial which consist of largely of argument over the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.167" offset="3656077">Mr. Scull was sentence to 10 days imprison and a $50 fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.954" offset="3675199">We file petitions for writs of error to the Supreme Court Appeals of Virginia from both the initial order to answer the questions and from the sentence in order to protect themselves and both orders were both petitions for writ of error were denied.</text>

            <text syncTime="942.317" offset="3872684">It has expired -- actually what has happened is that both of the committees that were set up as part of massive resistance on September 29th, 1956 expired at the end of 1957 or towards the end of 1957, but a new committee has been set up to carry on the work of the two whenever the new committee in an existence.</text>

            <text syncTime="992.655" offset="4074036">The rule seemed simply to be a weighing of the repressive effect of summoning and compelling a witness to answer against the interests of the State in obtaining the information which those answers would give.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.116" offset="4139865">And as I've said at the outset, we respectfully suggest that there is less -- that there is a greater repressive effect and a less interests of the State in getting this information than in any case presented to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.210" offset="4204231">The repressive effect is of course obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.974" offset="4219277">Here is a main question about associations with civic religious, political organizations fighting for a civil rights in an atmosphere of better local hostility to the principles for which this organization stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.755" offset="4282389">Indeed I suppose on this side of the case NAACP versus Alabama settle the matter quite clearly the repressive effect there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.349" offset="4320737">This Court unanimously held the repressive effect involved in forcing out the membership list of an organization of different beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.420" offset="4361070">It's worse here actually because you have not a single organizational tie of the petitioner at which this Committee was going, but all of these organizational ties with literally a dozen organization with B'nai B'rith, American Friends Service Committee, the National Conference of Christians and Jews, all sorts of organizations which are on record for the support of this Court's decision in Brown and which are thereby subject to hostility in the area in which the Committee operates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.203" offset="4508191">But it might be said well these are respected organization who doesn't want to admit he's a member of these organizations because of the respect in which they are held by thinking people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.587" offset="4561690">I would suggest to Your Honors that even the most respected organization one is entitled to freedom of association with them not that I -- not that I need to rest on that because he has asked on organizations which have real hostility this Court knows of the NAACP and the like but even on the other organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.761" offset="4662418">The ones less controversial it seems to me quite clear that a man has a right not to be compelled under subpoena to answer concerning those associations because in a sense merely being subpoenaed before governmental body and asked about them results in the idle curiosity of the general public, I would suggest, the suspicion of the credulous and the hatred of the bigotry no one it seems to me to be so subjective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.452" offset="4793135">Now, Mr. Thomson or the Committee wants to debate in the public prints with the petitioner and they want to take the position that this Court's decision is wrong and petition wants to take of the position that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.186" offset="4856142">That is the good old American way but for Mr. Thomson to use his subpoena to carry on this debate under circumstances where there are no fair response by the one under subpoena is a wholly different situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2337.781" offset="9454529">Now respondent's brief has two points in it as I would see them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.911" offset="9487026">First, the suggestion that we did not raised the Fourteenth Amendment at that point, this is on page 1 as an implication to this effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.608" offset="9525791">I would ask Your Honors to look at note 6 on page 14 of our brief in which we point out a dozen places in which we did raise the issue of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.643" offset="9585977">But just to make clear that we did it at the outset, I would call Your Honors attention to page 75 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.393" offset="9624952">And at page 75 of the record, Mr. Scull closes his statement, his opening statement for all of the foregoing reasons and on the basis of all the rights accorded to me under Section 8, 11 and 12 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the correlative provisions of the Federal Constitution are respectfully declined to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.865" offset="9718784">Section 12 of Article 1 of the Constitution of Virginia is a free speech section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.883" offset="9746892">It seems to me that one raises the point tactfully and honorably and clearly in the State of Virginia by referring to its constitutions and then saying the correlative provisions of the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.195" offset="9804152">The only other point made by the petitioner in his brief is that these were preliminary questions, but preliminary to what?</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.586" offset="9841768">Preliminary, they haven't said, preliminary to what these organizations do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.962" offset="9863189">This is a matter of public record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.845" offset="9870712">How could we measure?</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.562" offset="9877608">We're having enough trouble finding the question under inquiry in order to measure questions that were asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.551" offset="9901537">How could you measure against the question under inquiry question who haven't even been asked yet?</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.688" offset="9922121">So, I don't see that the preliminary issue can solve the respondent's difficulty.</text>

            <text syncTime="2878.134" offset="11615901">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.806" offset="11630634">I want to, again, touch briefly, I want to emphasize the purposes for which this Committee was formed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.642" offset="11665951">Mr. Rauh has stated some of the purposes but I think that he is more or less crossed over there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.756" offset="11690402">If you read the Act itself which is Chapter 37 of the Acts of the General Assembly of Virginia, Exposition 1956, you will find that one of the purposes was for the Committee to make investigations and recommendations one as to the taxable status of organizations engaged in racial litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.027" offset="11787473">The second purpose was to investigate and make recommendations back to the General Assembly with respect to the tax exempt status of donations and contributions to such organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.232" offset="11840345">And, the last that has been discussed quite a bit of length here is with respect to the laws relating to champerty, barratry, and maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.546" offset="11889560">Now, surely gentlemen, all of these are proper legislative functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.958" offset="11919235">And as it has been pointed out by this Court in a number of cases, the only way that a legislative body can properly operate and determine what legislation should be enacted is for that legislative body to act through its committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.395" offset="11993004">I think that the number of cases on that particular point are so many that it is unnecessary to repeat them at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.172" offset="12036054">Now, the contentions made by the petitioner as to the ultimate purposes of the Committee and of the General Assembly of Virginia are not supported by the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.941" offset="12091120">It maybe supported by some remarks made by Mr. Rauh in his argument to the Circuit Court of Arlington County and supported by some matters submitted in his brief here on the petition that is before the Court today in the appendix and in the footnotes when he refers to such material as the Washington Post and Times-Herald and quotes of great length from that organ and from Theology Today and from the Southern School News, but none of those things are part of the record in this case Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.981" offset="12239287">Therefore, I think that the matters mentioned by him and quoted by him along those lines are entitled to no consideration whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.898" offset="12286934">The only question before this Court is whether the questions asked of Mr. Scull were pertinent to an -- to an authorized investigation by an appropriately organized committee of a legislative body.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.428" offset="12361122">Of course, we contend that those questions were pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.943" offset="12379094">It cannot be assumed on the best assertion of a person who presumes to defy who Court comes to jurisdiction that it duly constituted legislative body would deliberately exceed or abuses authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.644" offset="12441997">As I said before, the things that the Committee was delegated to investigate certainly were matters which could be made subjects with appropriate legislation by the legislature of Virginia or the legislature of any other State in the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.070" offset="12511692">Now, as the petitioner's knowledge of the purposes of the inquiry, I'd like to point out one thing that's been omitted by Mr. Rauh.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.012" offset="12547427">I don't know whether he did it intentionally or whether he just forgot about it and that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.844" offset="12574699">The subpoena itself which is printed in the record at page 70 is petitioner's exhibit number one before the Circuit Court of Arlington County has set out the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.992" offset="12635303">After reciting that the subpoena was issued under the authority delegated by chapter 37 and so forth, the petitioner here today, Mr. Scull, was directed to appear before the Committee in the Circuit Courtroom Number One of the Arlington County Courthouse, Arlington Virginia on Friday the 28th of September 1957 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Savings Time to produce before said Committee and note this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.243" offset="12780335">“All papers, records, and documents in his possession or under his control pertaining to his participation and litigation relating to integration of the races in the public schools of Fairfax County Virginia or any other place, and to testify the truth to say in connection with an investigation being made by the said Committee relating to the need or lack of need for legislation pertaining to the activities of corporations, associations and other like groups which seek to influence, encourage or promote litigation relating to racial activities in this State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.619" offset="12945847">All of those things set forth in that subpoena were matters that were delegated to the Committee that inquire into by the act of the General Assembly.</text>

            <text syncTime="3240.597" offset="13065801">We had hearings in Fonville, in North Arlington and Alexandria and a similar subpoena was used in each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.043" offset="13103522">I might say however that at the original hearing in Richmond, certain officials of the NAACP were summons to appear before the Committee at the State Capital and were asked to produce certain specific documents most of which they did furnish, but some of which they refused to give us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.826" offset="13186696">The ones they refused to give us by the way happened to be a list of membership and this Court has now ruled in the Alabama case that it was not proper to ask for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.266" offset="13224417">We never did press that particular phase of the investigation, to ask the list of memberships for the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.779" offset="13254510">At that same meeting -- and Mr. Rauh made a point of this and he talked about this being a one hundred to one investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.652" offset="13289932">A representative of the defenders of the states rights and states sovereign, and states right was called before the Committee and produced voluminous records of that organization and testified under oath and the Committee was now able to find whether that organization had ever participated in or encourage any kind of litigation in the State of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.334" offset="13388675">In fact, we did make some preliminary investigations of other organizations that had been brought to our attention and we would never able to find that any other organization had encouraged litigation or participated in litigation in the State of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.269" offset="13452413">Now, as to his further knowledge, as to the -- Mr. Scull's further knowledge, as to the purposes of the inquiry, I might point out that in his statement that he furnished to the Committee which appears at page 75 of the record starting on page 74.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.626" offset="13545827">About the middle of page 75, he makes the following statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3394.750" offset="13682395">Now, as far as that is concerned, he says he doesn't have anything to hide and yet after he was asked the very first question, “Are you a member of the Fairfax County Council on Human Relations?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.649" offset="13753971">He refused to answer, submitted a statement and from then on refused to answer every question asked by the Committee on the basis of this statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3449.745" offset="13902346">Now, in that connection, it's my opinion and I've always found it to be true in the practice of law that the only way you can obtain the information as to the operation of organizations is by questioning those who are connected with such organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.969" offset="13959293">The organizations are being preachers of statute, most of them that is the corporations especially are official persons, have no way of answering except through their officers and members and so.</text>
