            <text syncTime="5.607" offset="125785">As we pause for recess, if Your Honors please, I was concluding my remark with respect to the three additional changes in the statute which we say were made and which appellants have failed to recognize as being changes in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.106" offset="199764">It's been pointed out that the mileage formula which was formerly in the statute, the apportionment formula is not in this statute and that the appellant, in making its return, did not attempt to assert any value for gross receipts in Virginia at all but rather answer that it had no gross receipts in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.702" offset="282206">And the Commission had to apply the section of the law which provides that where a -- a taxpayer fails or refuses to report, they shall make the return on the best information available.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.006" offset="335391">And in so doing, the Commission has reached a mileage formula to determine what gross receipts are.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.496" offset="357334">Now, it seems to us, a rather strange concept that a taxpayer can thus fail to report, and then come into court and complain that I didn't know what my gross receipts were, and I didn't report any gross receipts but the method you use is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.916" offset="431000">Either they did know or didn't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.659" offset="438000">The position they take is we don't know what our receipts were but we do know that what you say our receipts were -- were not our receipts in Virginia.</text>

            <text syncTime="104.416" offset="521070">If Your Honor please, if this is not a property tax, the only basis on which I say that the tax could be sustained would be that by virtue of the use of its property, the Delaware company's property by the Virginia company that that would be a sufficient basis for tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="142.695" offset="674147">And if -- if the decisions of the Court are such that no gross receipts tax, no matter how fairly apportioned or no matter what property it stands in lieu of, if gross receipts as such can never be used as a measure of a property tax, then I think I have very rough pleading from therein.</text>

            <text syncTime="191.418" offset="869021">But I think the answer -- in answer to -- to the question that if -- if the decisions of this Court are that you can never have a gross receipts tax, if -- if the fact that it's gross receipts denotes it as a privilege tax, then I don't get to amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.232" offset="940283">I'll stop it below.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.312" offset="948642">I say, in connection with that, now, I would like to get in to what I conceived to be the nature of this tax and why I conceived it would be nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.098" offset="987721">The Court will remember that under the prior tax, there was a decided -- a divided opinion of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.627" offset="1021889">The Court was divided 5-to-4 as to the nature of the prior tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.466" offset="1045191">And the majority of the Court, as we read the opinions, as we understand what the Court held, the Court laid great stress on what it characterized as a trinity of characterizations which it found in the statute in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.575" offset="1113631">The Court said, we start with the taxing statute in which the legislature gave a trinity of characterizations to the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.697" offset="1142157">It was declared to be in addition to the property tax not an additional property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.298" offset="1176534">It was named an annual license tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.921" offset="1187088">It was laid for the privilege of doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.276" offset="1200462">The Court went on, it is not an easy conclusion that the legislature did not know the actual character of the taxes it was laying.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.520" offset="1229406">All that it misconceived what it was taxing.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.160" offset="1244035">Now, to look at the amended statute in the light of that language of the Court, let us look at the three amendments which the appellant says were made in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.432" offset="1289070">First, he says, at two places in brief and repeated in oral argument today that one of the amendment was, that we levied a tax in lieu of a tax on other property rather than a tax in addition to the tax on other property.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.311" offset="1376632">The error in his statement is that the old tax was not said to be in addition to a tax on other property.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.627" offset="1421876">It was said to be a tax in addition to the tax on property not on other property.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.824" offset="1446640">And this Court used that as one of the trinity of characterizations that it wasn't an additional property tax or tax in addition to the tax on other property.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.847" offset="1498781">This time, it is a tax in lieu of a tax on intangible property and rolling stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.130" offset="1535875">Secondly, the Court found that it was labelled a license tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.883" offset="1554892">We certainly agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.766" offset="1558444">We urged last time that the license or the -- the label had no particular significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.607" offset="1585821">We still make that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.174" offset="1596061">But now, as before, we have taken the name license tax off of it, it should never have been there because it does not operate as a license tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.345" offset="1636707">Licenses are not issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.729" offset="1642245">It is not a prerequisite to the doing of business in the State of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.660" offset="1658023">It just doesn't operate as license tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.695" offset="1670144">And the collection of the tax is left to the ordinary process, it's for collection.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frederick T. Gray</label>
            <text syncTime="433.636" offset="1837955">No, if Your Honor please.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.780" offset="1842448">But I think in this particular situation, it becomes important because that was one of the basis on which the Court reached its conclusion last time.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.460" offset="1877243">I believe in -- in argument with -- in the Minnesota case on yesterday, Your Honor indicated that it was rather difficult for the Court to -- even though a state court may say this is a property tax, it's rather difficult when the language of the statute says this is levied for the -- for the purpose of doing business -- for the purpose of doing business in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.068" offset="1963656">But it's rather hard to make the jump and that label license tax was taken out of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.500" offset="1997406">And also the language for the privilege of doing business was taken out of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.735" offset="2038262">The minority opinion in the prior case, a dissenting opinion seems to point out very clearly to us that the basis of decision had largely been the fact that the legislature had characterized the tax as a privilege tax because in the minority opinion, this appears in some Virginia's tax should not be held unconstitutional merely because of the name the state legislature gave it.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.717" offset="2170232">The constitutionality of a State's tax laws should not depend on ability of state legislatures to foresee what tax language would most likely meet this Court's approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.044" offset="2223522">Now, we say that these changes which were made not only change the label of the tax but under this Court's decision, change the nature of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.851" offset="2306800">It is our position -- it was our position before that Virginia has attempted to levy a property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.035" offset="2339506">Its Constitution, Section 170 of the Constitution of Virginia envisions a property tax on this type of corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="777.765" offset="3214399">In the Cudahy Packing Company case, the Court discusses two earlier which were decided by this Court on the same -- very same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.538" offset="3257553">They being the Meyer against Wells Fargo and the United States Express Company case, both reported in 223 US.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.410" offset="3301021">The Meyer case, there was a gross receipts tax which was levied in addition to the tax on property.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.809" offset="3350653">And the Court held that that was bad, that was a void tax, that there was -- since there was a tax on the property already, you couldn't say it was a property tax, it had to be a privilege tax and therefore the tax fell.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.131" offset="3403943">But on the same day, they decided the United States Express Company case which on facts is very, very similar to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.229" offset="3436335">It did business in the same manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.895" offset="3446993">And there, the gross receipts tax was levied in lieu of a tax on property, and the Court held that this is but a measure of the value of the corporation's property and the tax was sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.095" offset="3511777">In addition, the Court said that this is the only tax in the State that falls upon this property.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.883" offset="3558902">Now, when this case was here before, there was a tax of 50 cents per $100 in value in the statute on the intangibles of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.957" offset="3603205">This time, that tax on intangible values has been removed from the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="923.584" offset="3797661">It is a gross receipts tax in lieu of a tax on property.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.530" offset="3817514">Now, the appellant cites the United States Glue Company case has authority for the proposition that gross receipts cannot be used to measure going concern value or property values that gross receipts indicates a privilege tax and it always has to be a privilege tax if it's measured by gross receipts.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.339" offset="3920750">In the first place, the United States Glue Company case, it was decided in 1918, it did not have -- the Court did not have before a gross receipts tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.429" offset="3953037">It had before a net tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.608" offset="3965785">And -- and what we submit was dicta, the Court said that a net tax does not have the vice which could be inherit in a gross receipts tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.450" offset="4017194">And Mr. Justice Black, in the Gwin case pointed out that U.S. Glue, the comments with respect to gross receipts in U.S. Glue was really dicta.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.058" offset="4071633">As we have read the opinions of this Court and the decisions of this Court with respect to gross receipts taxes, those taxes which have fallen, fell because they were not fairly or properly apportioned within the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.403" offset="4128998">They have not fallen just because the tax was a gross receipts tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.958" offset="4155225">And in that connection, there is in the case of Western Live Stock, Mr. Justice Stone's opinion a discussion of gross receipts taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.631" offset="4193886">And if I may just very briefly, I will not try to read it in full but just to hit the highlights of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.736" offset="4222307">Taxation measured by gross receipts from interstate commerce has been sustained when fairly apportioned to the commerce carried on within the taxing State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.483" offset="4265253">Say, Maine -- Maine against Grand Trunk, Cudahy Packing, United States Express against Minnesota, which I have just referred to you, has been rejected in other cases only because the apportionment was found to be inadequate or unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.650" offset="4325961">Now, it goes on to say that it is a practical way of laying upon commerce its share of the local tax burden without subjecting it to multiple taxation, it would be fairly apportioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.849" offset="4394820">As we read the prior decision of this Court, we understood the prior decision of this Court, it seems to us that the Court would not have gone to the great lengths that it did go to analyze the Virginia tax to point out that it was labeled license tax, that it was said to be in addition to property and that it was said to be for the privilege of doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.057" offset="4487607">If the law is that a gross receipts tax per se is a privilege tax, the Court could have said that and no more in the prior Virginia case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.307" offset="4536613">They could merely have said, "This tax is measured by gross receipts hence, it is a privilege tax, hence, it has to fall under the facts of this case."</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.420" offset="4581021">Now, we -- we do not believed that this Court has laid down a rule that every gross receipts tax, no matter how fairly apportioned is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.642" offset="4629922">I see that I -- my time is quickly passing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.581" offset="4645700">I would just like to point out a few other factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.946" offset="4659179">That number one, the Constitution of Virginia in Section 170 provides that we can levy a franchise tax in lieu of a tax or other property or corporation such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.881" offset="4718947">So that the Constitution -- the language of the Constitution, when it says in lieu of a tax on other property, clearly envisions this type of tax to be a tax on the going concern or the intangible value of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.835" offset="4774745">That was what it meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.575" offset="4781641">The debates, some of the debates of the Framers of the Constitution are set forth in our brief and it can clearly be seen from those that the Framers of the Constitution envision a system of taxation where the going concern value would be reached by tax measured by gross receipts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1323.505" offset="5397400">And as the Virginia court had recognized that very recently wherein in the Olan Mills case where the photographers were coming in and doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.733" offset="5426343">And -- and the Virginia court itself brought down local license taxes against this people, then you can't so burden this company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.473" offset="5457272">But whereas here, the State sets up a system of taxation and says, “Now, we ought to be able to get it all the value of this company, all of their value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.361" offset="5508786">Their bare bones, their tracks, their bridges, their trucks, everything they have.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.944" offset="5527176">And in addition to that, we are fairly entitled to tax the intangible element of value which it has as a going concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.275" offset="5560508">That piece of track is worth nothing but as a part of this railroad, it has a value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.403" offset="5577017">Now, in order to do this, we are going to allow the localities to tax the bare bones.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.633" offset="5601886">No good will, no going concern value but mere bare bones.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.691" offset="5618186">And we are going to allow the State to impose what is called a “franchise tax” measured by the gross receipts of this company to reach this increment of the value of this corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.345" offset="5680776">Now, that is a scheme of taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.915" offset="5687045">Then they go on and say, “When you have done that, then we will not tax the dividend of this company in the hands of its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.653" offset="5714004">That we have gone far in -- in the stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.073" offset="5723617">And we have gone far enough when we get all of the value, then that's all that we should tax.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.605" offset="5745768">That is the Virginia scheme of taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.406" offset="5756949">Now, we say that it is a fair scheme and it does not over burden or does not burden interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.829" offset="5786728">It certainly does not discriminate to use just a little -- something little straight which is in the brief to point up what we would come to this tax falls in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.236" offset="5840332">Two shipments could be made out of the City of Richmond, one going to Bristol, Virginia, one going to Bristol, Tennessee across the street from one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.301" offset="5876590">They could be held by the same employee of this company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.200" offset="5892159">They could be written up on the same bill of lading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.216" offset="5900204">They could ride in the same trucks, in the same railroad cars and one of them would be taxed because it's intrastate, the other with state tax because it goes across the street to Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.998" offset="5947329">So, certainly we can see that there is no discrimination against interstate commerce under this scheme of taxation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1510.591" offset="6145755">If Your Honor please, just a few words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.231" offset="6168325">We have been summarizing our position as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.403" offset="6180968">The Spector Motor case laid down in a clear and definitive way, and I last said to have adopted a phrase that has -- had quite reasons of significance, had been accepted as the law of the land in 12 States as controlling on the principle that gross receipts or -- or net income however fairly apportioned and however non-discriminatory may not be imposed on either gross or net income from a corporation engaged solely in the interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.102" offset="6367796">Now, that's the -- that's the -- they're not in the shell of Spector Motor case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.491" offset="6393292">And we rely on that for our premise and that is that if, and it is a lot of talk these briefs but the stipulation set me -- there, the record sustained that this corporation is engaged solely in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.900" offset="6447000">Now, this tax is solely on gross receipts derived from interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.699" offset="6466121">Now, while it'd be fairly apportioned or whether be non-discriminatory, under the Spector Motor case, it's invalid if it's a tax on the gross receipts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.001" offset="6507395">Now, therefore, we – and -- and it's for the reasons that I have argued, it is a tax on gross receipts and nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.262" offset="6536443">If it however be considered to be property tax, then this -- we rely on what this Court said in the prior appeal in this case in which was considered -- we have said but we have declined for a judge mere gross receipts of the sound measure of going concern value in a practical world of commerce where value is obtained on profits of a business and not as mere volume.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.165" offset="6648038">Now, there is no question about the fact that they have filed the measure, this intangible or so-called “goodwill value by gross receipts”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.737" offset="6682311">And the Court meant what it said in that case, in we certainly feel it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.646" offset="6697984">That's not a proper measure of value to determine the value of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.965" offset="6719195">Now, we don't question the power of the State to tax all property of a corporation engaged in interstate commerce where it'd be tangible or intangible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.587" offset="6753677">It has taxed all the tangible property and the taxes have been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.372" offset="6768828">It's seeks to reach this in quitting this goodwill value by measurement by gross receipts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.568" offset="6801638">Well, now, if it -- what does this Court said in the prior appeal in this case is sound long, we accept it -- believe it could be, then you can't use that measure of determining goodwill value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.168" offset="6844061">And that's this whole case.</text>
