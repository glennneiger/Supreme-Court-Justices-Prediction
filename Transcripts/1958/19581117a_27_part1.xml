            <text syncTime="19.969" offset="183254">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.670" offset="198092">This case is concerned with the problem of poisonous coal-tar colors in the nation's foods.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.304" offset="224632">Congress has provided that the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare shall promulgate regulation providing for the listing of coal-tar colors that are harmless and suitable for use in foods and for the certification of batches of such colors with or without harmless -- I mean, without harmless diluent.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.832" offset="314702">These regulations are to be promulgated after public proceedings on the basis of evidence and are subject to judicial review in the United States Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.583" offset="353677">In 1939, after a hearing, the color FD&amp;C Red 32 was placed on the list for unrestricted use in foods, drugs and cosmetics.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.123" offset="399862">In 1947 to 1950, there developed certain scientific and congressional unrest over the possible toxicity of a number of the coal-tar colors, particularly the oil-soluble colors.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.635" offset="453883">So, the Food and Drug Administration of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare undertook a new scientific appraisal of the toxic potential of these colors.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.912" offset="499022">Study was initiated in 1951 and continued until 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.229" offset="524309">The method of studying the colors was to feed them in small amounts to test animals, rats and dog, which would be -- could be kept under a controlled environment, their feed and other circumstances watched.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.598" offset="581778">They could be observed during their lifetime, sacrificed in autopsy at the end of the experiment.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.815" offset="610617">When the experiment was over, the Department frankly called the industry representatives and -- and gave it the result saying that in the Department's opinion, the colors have proved to be toxic and not harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.244" offset="660355">A hearing was scheduled held in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.955" offset="675192">Hearing lasted only a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.846" offset="686791">The sole scientific evidence was presented by the United States Government by one witness, a Dr. Vos.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.288" offset="716570">He testified that the color was fed at various levels to rats and to dogs.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.048" offset="739558">At 2% in the diet of rats killed all the rats within a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.583" offset="757739">At 1%, all the rats were dead in 12 days at a 0.5% in 21 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.152" offset="783966">The lower levels were fed down to a thousand parts per million which is a tenth of 1% in the diet, and at the lowest level fed there were distinct injuries to the animals when they were all toxic, the injuries being to heart, liver, spleen and to the muscular dystrophy activities of the body.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.910" offset="879052">Dogs fed at somewhat lower levels, 400 parts and 100 parts per million.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.558" offset="901622">At 400 parts, all -- all the dogs involved died.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.282" offset="916459">At 100 parts, one of four dogs sickened and died.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.602" offset="937775">The least toxic of the three colors involved was the only one that had been involved in a human episode of poisoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.470" offset="965256">Orange 1, it had been involved in an acute poisoning and the symptom which it produced was diarrhea, the objective symptom it being the same symptom produced in the test animal.</text>

            <label>Mr. William W. Goodrich</label>
            <text syncTime="258.755" offset="1138395">I think not, sir, but my opponents do argue that.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.652" offset="1149994">I think since the findings of part not harmlessness have been sustained in both circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.641" offset="1169951">That -- that finding is binding here, but my opponents do argue that point, so I was briefly covering the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.203" offset="1196178">There was, as anticipated here, no controversy about whether the color itself was a toxic color.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.665" offset="1226062">Indeed, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit having a review by the entire industry sustained the whole order.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.807" offset="1258559">However, the Florida and Texas floors pressed for a use of this color at limit -- for this limited purpose of coloring the Texas and Florida oranges orange and argued that in this special use, the color could be used as a harmless coal-tar color.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.787" offset="1330552">The idea of restricted use was not pressed at the original hearing, but was brought up on rehearing after the initial findings had been made and a few days before the case went to the Court of Appeals in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.012" offset="1383424">The Secretary refused to open the hearing to take evidence on this for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.310" offset="1404635">First, that there was no evidence of record showing the foods in which the color had been used in addition to oranges.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.743" offset="1438386">And second, there was no evidence on which a safe level of feeding to man could be established because there was no safe level for the rats or dogs.</text>

            <label>Mr. William W. Goodrich</label>
            <text syncTime="355.819" offset="1526680">That comes from an analysis by a Dr. Gerwe which is outside the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.654" offset="1546010">It's based on a direct transposition of the amount of color that killed the rats.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.924" offset="1567117">Now, our answer to that is that it served no purpose to draw a comparison with a -- an amount of toxic material that killed the rats.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.854" offset="1598777">What we are concerned with is an amount that could be safely taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.369" offset="1612884">And on this record, no such level has been established since the lowest amount federal, 100 parts per million killed the test dog.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.929" offset="1647052">So we start and basic to our argument is, the point that no safe level of feeding has yet been established even for the test animals.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.921" offset="1687071">Now, the Court of Appeals in New Orleans did and defined that Red 32 could and must be safely tolerated on oranges alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.061" offset="1731584">It supported this not by evidence in the record but by the fact that Secretary Folsom and Commissioner Larrick had testified on proposed temporary legislation to the effect that they had no positive evidence at that time, that Red 32 on oranges alone would poison man.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.713" offset="1822177">At the same time, they pointed out to the Congress that neither was there a safe level of feeding for the test animals.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.949" offset="1851120">They simply proposed to the Congress that the industry be allowed a three-year period which expires on March 1st of this year in order to hopefully develop a nontoxic color and failing that, to further explore the toxicity of Red 32 so that the matter might be taken back to the Congress and authority obtained for fixing a safe level.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.813" offset="1950595">Now, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit decided this case as if it concerned oranges and oranges alone, but plainly, the principle which applies to oranges must also apply to all your margin and to any other color or any other food in which one of these colors is economically needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.966" offset="2035231">The Fifth Circuit did not decide the case on the basis of the statutory provision accorded to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.963" offset="2063235">They did not decide that the color was harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.931" offset="2075146">They decided that harm, it should be read in a relative sense and that led them into the preceding paragraph under which Congress authorized the establishment of safe tolerances for added poisonous and added deleterious substances required in the production of foods.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.207" offset="2152155">In the case of such a -- an added poison, Congress authorized the Secretary to establish safe tolerances taking into account the extent to which the color was required and all other factors in order that the total load of the poison in a variety of foods would not injure man.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.348" offset="2232717">In the Fifth Circuit, the Court said to the Secretary that he could not supplant his 1939 finding of harmlessness until he was prepared to show that color added oranges themselves would be dangerous to the health of man.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.916" offset="2303039">Chief Judge Hutcheson dissented calling this, what it so plainly was, judicial legislation, dictated more by the needs of the industry than by a fair consideration of either the law or the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.577" offset="2357687">Now, on this record, there can be no question but what Red 32 itself is not a harmless color.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.304" offset="2388616">It could not be classified as anything but a toxic color and both Circuits sustained the finding to that extent.</text>

            <text syncTime="594.974" offset="2483284">This product, this color was fed at levels toxicologically significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.236" offset="2504286">The toxicologist who gave the undisputed evidence said that he used harmless in a pharmacological sense, meaning that he compared it with other known toxics.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.767" offset="2542425">Now, my opponents point out that water and salt could be abused.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.029" offset="2567502">Of course, they could, but that would not make them a harmful substance nor would a small amount of cyanide or -- in the Red 32, make it a harmless substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.705" offset="2622151">We think, and we will develop that in our argument that Congress itself considered that color should be without adverse physiological effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.129" offset="2659871">That's what they meant when they said harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.492" offset="2669380">The committees were told that that was a system that had been in effect and the Committee report show that it was the intention of the Congress to provide innocuous colors for use in food which could then be used in any amount by the manufacturer to achieve any tint or hue he wished without any hazard whatever to health.</text>

            <label>Mr. William W. Goodrich</label>
            <text syncTime="723.481" offset="2997269">That's what I conceive to be the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.886" offset="3006882">Now, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit conceived a different issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.670" offset="3022033">That is that harmless should be used to mean relatively harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.552" offset="3045543">And when you construed harmless to mean relatively harmless, that meant you could go to the other provision, 406 (a), which authorizes the Secretary to tolerate added poisonous and deleterious substances.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.250" offset="3100400">Now, I agree with you that these concepts, theoretically, are difficult to apply but we have them in the statutory setting, fully explained by the administrative officials going back, as you point out, Dr. Osburg's time.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.708" offset="3162154">Dr. (Inaudible) developed this system before or where it took off and although the Department was urged in 1907 to permit the use of colors that were harmless under the conditions of use, that scheme was rejected, the very first regulation that ever was put out which I'll refer to in a bulletin in our brief was that only harmless color should be permitted and after reviewing the entire scientific background throughout the world, as well as all the foreign laws, it was concluded that only harmless colors would be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.406" offset="3308962">Now, that system came forward into 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.491" offset="3325367">They developed, of course, some difficulties with it because the word harmless was not in the Act of 1906.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.488" offset="3353370">Instead, Congress provided that a food would be deemed to be adulterated if it bears or contains any added poisonous or added deleterious substance which may render the food injurious to health.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.475" offset="3405302">Now, at the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in 1923 held that the Department could not prevent the use of a coal-tar color in a food, although it contained some arsenic because the arsenic was not present in large amount to make the food itself dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.210" offset="3480221">That was recognized by the Congress in 1933, very first memorandum sent out by Senator Copeland pointing this out as a weakness in the law that the Department could not prevent the use of toxic coal-tar colors unless it could prove that the color itself made each particular food injurious to health.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.958" offset="3567156">Now, when we turn to the plain language of the statute, we find the word harmless used in contrast with the preceding Section 406 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="876.652" offset="3609997">406 (a) says that food shall be deemed to be adulterated if it bears or contains any added poisonous or added deleterious substance, unless the substance is required in production or unavoidable in good manufacturing practice, in which case the Department was authorized to establish (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="896.018" offset="3687424">Then Paragraph (b) of the very same section says that the Secretary shall promulgate regulation, providing for the listing and certification of harmless coal-tar colors.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.877" offset="3734862">Now, this difference in language was neither inadvertent nor meaningless and certainly in the setting in which it appeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.119" offset="3763806">It meant precisely what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.689" offset="3782092">The statutory plan for colors is one in which the Department is authorized to exercise their laboratory type control.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.911" offset="3823052">It is enabled under this system to protect the public health by simply withholding its stamp of approval from a color which is not totally harmless for use in food and thereby, assure the food manufacturer that he can use the color in any amount without being concerned about its possible toxicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.118" offset="3911868">Both the color industry and indeed the food industry have so understood this plan of control for a great many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.281" offset="3940498">At the hearing, the color industry testified that it had no evidence, whatever, on what foods use what color or what amount of food use what color.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.041" offset="3987519">This was regarded by the industry as wholly unimportant because they believe the colors to be innocuous.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.458" offset="4017194">Had there had been any suspicion, otherwise, they would have taken some steps to accumulate data and to exercise precautions against unsafe levels of usage in food.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.613" offset="4061811">If there be any doubt, whatever, about the plain meaning of the statute, in this setting in which it appears, both the administrative background and the legislative history which I've reviewed briefly support this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.162" offset="4116041">This voluntary system of control established by Dr. Wiley and Dr. Hesse (ph) in 1906 continued up until the Wood case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.945" offset="4147179">The weakness in the law was pointed out by Senator Copeland, the principal spokesman at the time of the legislative history of the Act of 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.744" offset="4186363">Now, this law was in Congress for five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.740" offset="4198379">This Court itself has pointed out that the sponsors, the draftsmen and the congressional committees all had an intelligent understanding of the many provisions here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.080" offset="4239653">Mr. (Inaudible) explained in just these words that the existing system was, “under this procedure, those colors which were demonstrated to be without adverse physiological effect in which from a technical standpoint are suitable for use in foods were admitted to certification.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.437" offset="4313109">The plan was to assure that the colors used would be nontoxic and free of deleterious ingredients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.445" offset="4341112">At one time in the development of this law, an effort was made by the citrus growers to enact a special provision which would have allowed them to continue coloring of citrus “by means harmless to the consumer,” and to exempt the coloring from label declaration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.738" offset="4406314">This was not adopted and in its -- and instead we come far with the existing provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.734" offset="4430346">Throughout this entire legislative history, the color provisions, the provisions relating to added poisonous and added deleterious substances were discussed separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.750" offset="4470366">They were to deal with two related but different problems and they developed different controller systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.349" offset="4500773">For colors, a laboratory certification, the Secretary's stamp of approval on the color that it was indeed harmless and could be used without restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.187" offset="4544136">For added poisonous and deleterious substances, the enactment of precise tolerances, taking into account the entire load of the poison in a variety of food as well as related pharmacologically and chemically related substances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1784.702" offset="7242167">Now, 406 (a) was designed to tighten your controls over poisons in foods, not to loosen it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.757" offset="7266408">Under this Court's decision in Lexington Mill &amp; Elevator in 3 -- in 232 U.S., this Court had given very comprehensive meaning to the Food and Drugs Act of 1906.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.516" offset="7309458">It had held that any food which bore -- bears or contains any added poisonous or added deleterious substance which may render the food injurious to health was an adulterated food.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.842" offset="7354702">The Court held it may render the food injurious to health, meant any possibility of injuring any segment of the public, the strong and the weak, the old and young, the well and the sick.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.304" offset="7404544">But as strong as that decision was, it enabled the Department, only to deal with one food at a time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.098" offset="7431816">If you had one food with a level of poison just below the danger level and another food with the same poison just below the danger level and both foods were eaten together, the consumer would get a toxic amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.869" offset="7486882">Now, this weakness was pointed out to the Congress by Mr. (Inaudible) and Senator Copeland and Congress on the Department via Section 406 (a) with the power to deal with a common poison in a variety of foods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.083" offset="7543724">The solution was a flat prohibition against all added poisonous and added deleterious substances, unless, they were required in production.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.966" offset="7575280">It was enough that the substance itself was a part of this.</text>

            <text syncTime="2891.147" offset="11667937">At first I will to try clear a few situations and give information that may be helpful to the Court by reason of the questions that have arisen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.126" offset="11703881">The reason it is necessary to color oranges is climatic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.539" offset="11733556">The reason you color more in one season than you do another is because of the difference in season, as we have a late cold or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.381" offset="11764903">The early oranges -- and then what I'm stating is some place and other different places in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.822" offset="11786637">The early orange in Florida will become mature and still be green on the outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.275" offset="11824462">It takes the cold nights and the warm days to color an orange.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.983" offset="11843271">Then when the cold comes, that will turn in a very beautiful color.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.228" offset="11872319">But at that time, the fruit which is a very fine fruit to eat a few weeks previously can be insipid and over mature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.615" offset="11909831">And that is the reason the early oranges have to be colored.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.753" offset="11938356">The late orange has a different problem, the Valencia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.715" offset="11954239">And the Valencia in Florida and oranges one of the few fruits that will have blooms and little oranges just coming out of the bloom and practically mature fruit all at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.395" offset="12004916">And when the chlorophyll goes into the tree in the spring, it goes back into the orange and you will have a Valencia, a beautiful orange in January or February when the -- it is -- we've had the cool nights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.848" offset="12086732">And it's not yet good to eat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.613" offset="12097808">It's still immature on the inside.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.816" offset="12110660">In other words, you've got a -- a ripe appearing orange on the outside and green and immature on the inside.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.877" offset="12142843">And in some instance, it'd be totally green and in -- in other instances, it will be streaky and when it reaches fully matured, it's greener on the outside that it was when it's immature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.264" offset="12204387">The Department of Agriculture for a long period of time studied more than 30 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.680" offset="12226121">They started studies of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.191" offset="12248168">In a way, they are the ones that taught us to do this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.676" offset="12262066">They're in the yearbook and official reports which I have quoted in my brief so they can go and get a picture of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.779" offset="12302503">They told why we had to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.906" offset="12315042">One of the first of the instances in having the color and when they start to use it was over on the State, we don't think much of -- that raises citrus but was in Mr. Justice Black's State of Alabama, Satsuma.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.595" offset="12377736">The Satsuma will get a -- a good tasting and still be green on the outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.131" offset="12399888">They were raising a few Satsumas and there was experimentation carried that and that's the reason, economically, we have to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.046" offset="12431548">It's been part of the agriculture said it repeatedly, both the Senate and the House Committees in their report said it was an economic necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.880" offset="12470941">The -- in -- by reason of the fact that this quotation in the brief with reference to the testimony of the Florida Citrus Commission, the Florida Citrus Commission of the State through the Attorney General has filed a very short brief explaining to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.167" offset="12548054">And in there, there is the -- a table on page 4 showing the percentage of coloring and it's -- runs there by years there since 1938 and 1939 up to 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.733" offset="12614301">And in many years, we've colored 72.7%, 70.9%, 69.4%, 65%, 61.9%, 65%, 160%, 64.3%, 63% and the highest was in 1945, 76% as of all the fresh fruit is colored with this color.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.596" offset="12713775">There are few instances if you have -- in the end, in the other section, there are few that grows on -- well, the fruit may color fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.178" offset="12748048">It's a smaller percentage and answering the distinguished Justice's question about what whether other people use this not, the record will show that the Chase &amp; Company who filed the petition as a friend of the Court and is opposed generally to the coloring of fruit, covered more -- colored more and all the half of all the fruit he shipped.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.408" offset="12857031">It's just a question if -- if you happen to have a good season in one part of the State, the color is good, you don't have to color.</text>

            <text syncTime="4895.015" offset="19683453">First, if the word 'harmless' is construed to mean, harmless in the -- in the amounts used and for the purposes used then we can design a color that can be used for the coloring of oranges without danger to public health, but if the Department's interpretation is correct and that is that all color must be absolutely harmless and if they are fairly correct, that they will not -- do not have the power to establish the tolerances for the use of that color for the purposes for which it's designed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4940.613" offset="19865788">Then we can never qualify a color that will color oranges.</text>

            <text syncTime="4954.511" offset="19921377">Suffice it to say that it's recognized in numerous official publications and is an economic fact of life in the citrus industry that the public mistakenly associates the color of the orange with maturity and as Mr. Peterson has explained, there is no relation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4976.083" offset="20007685">A great many times, the orange has a beautiful orange color before it is mature and the late orange has the -- the green color before the maturity.</text>

            <text syncTime="5639.771" offset="22662457">Now, the test which were conducted in 1952 and 1953 were conducted for an entirely different purpose, admittedly so, by the Governments' brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5651.986" offset="22711359">They tested only to see if the color could be given in such massive amounts that it would produce an adverse effect and of course, it did.</text>

            <text syncTime="6059.026" offset="24339519">As I understood, both you and Mr. Peterson, there are limitation, there are restrictions inherent in the orange industry, to be used, so that he doesn't have to establish any tolerances because it's only used at such a low level that there's no gain to put a ceiling.</text>

            <text syncTime="6081.363" offset="24428857">But if he wants -- if he -- he's afraid that they're going to ingest 2500 oranges a day and get poisoned, we want him to say that this can be limited so that they'll have to eat 3000, four parts per million.</text>
            <text syncTime="6094.773" offset="24482461">We are not afraid of any tolerance that can be established because four parts per million is so infinitesimal in comparison.</text>
            <text syncTime="6107.912" offset="24535019">Let me give you the illustration, 2500 oranges, peeling and all, to ingest enough of this color on a weight basis that was used to make the rats sick and the dogs eat.</text>
            <text syncTime="6122.200" offset="24592175">Now, if Your Honor please, to show you that the Court -- that the Department has taken that very attitude toward colors other than no use to color oranges.</text>
            <text syncTime="6134.603" offset="24641808">In -- as late as 1950 in the official publications, the Department approved the use of a color called Violet No. 1 and specifically admitted that it could be bad in such large amounts that it would produce an adverse effect, but said that in the purposes for which it was used and in the amounts, no human being would by any possibility suffer adverse effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="6161.542" offset="24749537">All we want is that applied to oranges.</text>

            <text syncTime="6174.730" offset="24802304">I'd like to address myself first to the arguments my opponents have made about 5000 oranges and 2500 oranges and 50 times more or less toxic than Red 32 and other statements which I believe are somewhat exaggerated from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="6191.694" offset="24870118">The comparisons drawn of 50, 5000 oranges, 2500 oranges are all based on a transposition of the rat studies directly to man.</text>
            <text syncTime="6203.810" offset="24918601">The amounts of colors involved in the rat study, 1000 parts per million killed the rats.</text>
            <text syncTime="6209.640" offset="24941902">That is not a safe level.</text>
            <text syncTime="6211.508" offset="24949426">The lowest amount fed to dogs, 100 parts, killed one of the dogs.</text>
