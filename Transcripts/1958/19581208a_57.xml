            <label>Mr. Paul A. Sweeney</label>
            <text syncTime="43.321" offset="276668">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, draws out of an action for libel brought by two civilian employees of the Boston Navy Yard against Admiral Howard, the commander of that yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.139" offset="351901">The alleged ground of libel, the report issued by Admiral Howard and transmitted to his superior, copies of which he also furnished the members of the Massachusetts Delegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.892" offset="406967">The District Court entered judgment for the petitioner on the ground that the pleadings and affidavits conclusively established the statements attributed to petitioner were published by him on the discharge of his official duties and in relations to matters committed to him for determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.841" offset="502784">On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed on the part as to the communication to his superiors but held that the communication to the -- or the publication to the members of the Congressional Delegation of Massachusetts was at the best qualifiedly privileged and remanded the case before the proceedings in accordance with its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.940" offset="611140">This Court has now granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.871" offset="622843">The facts in this case are relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.674" offset="638098">And they are comprised the pleadings and two affidavits filed in support of a motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.377" offset="672893">The respondents here, the plaintiffs in the District Court, Lyons and McAteer, were civilian employees of the Boston Navy Yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.771" offset="706435">They were also officers of an organization known as the Federal Employees Veterans Association with purpose was to bring together an association of veterans employed by the Federal Government to protect all veterans' rights which are conferred by various laws and regulations, and also to seek to better the affairs and the rights of veterans employed by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.390" offset="816880">Now, the Navy has an industrial relations policy which applies particularly on navy yards in which there's an encouragement of representative groups forming and dealing with the -- the management of the stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.984" offset="875290">I believe in Massachusetts at the Boston Navy Yard, there were probably 30 some odd organizations represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.731" offset="902248">They would represent labor unions, veteran's organizations and different groups who are in a position to speak for and represent the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.401" offset="936939">In 1949, the FEVA, this Federal Employees Veterans Association, was recognized as a bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.687" offset="982079">It originated in this post number 1, was an association of the employees at the Boston Navy Yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.015" offset="1011440">That recognition continued for a number of years, but there's no question but that the FEVA was extremely militant in undertaking to protect the rights of its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.821" offset="1074657">It represented them at grievance hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.018" offset="1083434">It was instrumental in certain litigation, some of which was successful and bettered the rights of the members of the association.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.670" offset="1126066">The FEVA also put out a week -- a monthly newsletter, which was distributed among its members which were given to members of the Congressional Delegation of Massachusetts and released to the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.148" offset="1191999">Over a period of time, these newsletters yet, became extremely critical of management, the Navy Yard management.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.491" offset="1237347">They went further.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.353" offset="1240795">They criticized the policy of the Navy Department as such, the executive department as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.480" offset="1269321">It appeared about the beginning of 1955, that certain complaints they had made at the Massachusetts Delegation resulted in an investigation as to the personnel policies and other matters being pursued at the Boston Navy Yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.686" offset="1334105">At the conclusion of that, the investigation, it was decided and determined that no violations had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.846" offset="1362735">Shortly thereafter, the petitioner here, Admiral Howard became Commandant of the station and he immediately began to encounter difficulties with the representatives of FEVA.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.715" offset="1410278">Now, these matters are set forth in this report which was sent to the Bureau of Ships and the Bureau of Industrial Relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.168" offset="1440057">And he comments in that, that the -- that with all other organizations they found them were beneficial and helpful, that the tendency of this organization was to magnify trivialities, to belittle management and you could only conclude that their whole purpose was to attack managements, to complain, to keep things in the turmoil.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.722" offset="1534307">And as they characterized it, the thing was openly subversive as to the management of the station.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.396" offset="1564923">I think that the words which are relied upon as probably being potentially libelous in this, but if they are obviously referred to management.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.405" offset="1600972">They also said that it was bad on the morale, both of the management itself and of other employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.248" offset="1632319">As a result thereof, he decided to withdraw recognition of this union as a bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.143" offset="1655933">As I said before, copies of this report were sent to the -- through the Commandant of the First Naval District to the Bureau of Ships and Bureau of Industrial Relation of the Navy Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.398" offset="1725001">He also sent copies of the report to all members of the Massachusetts Congressional Delegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.860" offset="1778813">The Commandant of the First Naval District, Admiral Schnackenberg, through the Public Information Office of that district, released copies of this to the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.275" offset="1824475">This occurred on September 9, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.133" offset="1843911">A year later, presumably, just before the local statute of limitations in this suit was instituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.911" offset="1875048">Now, it may have the usual allegations of libel that it was malicious, false, for the purpose of -- that the defendant there, petitioner here, departed entirely from his duty and unusually used it as a subterfuge for the purpose of maintaining this malicious attack upon the two plaintiffs who are officers of the FEVA, one of whom was identified by name in the report, and the other by description.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.703" offset="2022170">An answer was filed in which it was sort of one count of the answer and denial in the manner in form because, while this report was attached to the complaint it did not have the exhibit, so that went with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.352" offset="2092805">Also, as a defense, it was alleged that the statements were true, that they were in the performance of his duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.474" offset="2125302">And finally, there was a complaint that they were absolutely privileged because they were matters upon which he acted in the performance of his duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.575" offset="2165635">Before any evidence was taken, a motion for a summary judgment was filed, and two affidavits were submitted in support thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.316" offset="2196668">One affidavit by Admiral Schnackenberg, the Commandant of the First Naval District, recited that he was Admiral Howard's superior.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.931" offset="2243062">And on the date this was issued to Admiral Howard was in the exercise of his functions and duties as Commander of the Boston Navy Yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.675" offset="2278066">That among his duties was to notify the Bureau of Ships and the Office of Industrial Relations of the Navy Department of any significant changes and personnel policy that took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.210" offset="2336162">And that this was the title, a report which should be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.339" offset="2356746">He also stated that one of Admiral Howard's duties was to keep the Boston -- the Massachusetts Congressional Delegation advised of any significant personnel changes such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.345" offset="2416724">He said that the release to the press had been effectuated by his office.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.520" offset="2437413">Admiral Howard also submitted an affidavit in which he said that he had performed these acts in accordance with his duties, that his first duty was to make these reports or a report of any significant personation of chain such as this was to the Bureau of Ships and the Bureau of Industrial Relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.712" offset="2518183">And that it was also one of his duties to send copies of that to the Massachusetts Delegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.025" offset="2543470">He denied that he had made any release to the newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.009" offset="2559457">This affidavit was uncontroverted, and as I noted before in my statement that the District Court made a finding that the pleadings in the affidavits showed conclusively that the statements attributed to Admiral Howard were published by him in the discharge of his official duties and in relations committed to him for determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.741" offset="2658304">It -- and the judgment for the defendant, dismissed the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.956" offset="2687248">On appeal --</text>

            <text syncTime="658.688" offset="2738134">I don't think he dealt with the question as to whether that it was given to the press because he would have held, I think, that they had Admiral Howard giving it to the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.271" offset="2776482">It probably would have been in relation to his duties because Admiral Schnackenberg did testify that it was part of Admiral Howard's duties to give these to the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.203" offset="2808142">However, the undisputed evidence, both from Admiral Schnackenberg and Admiral Howard is that the release was by Admiral Schnackenberg and by not Admiral Howard.</text>

            <text syncTime="712.740" offset="2954324">The District Court did not bother to make that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.700" offset="2970206">The Court of Appeals did discuss it some.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.842" offset="2982745">Now, the Court of Appeals stated that there were three publications alleged in the light of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.542" offset="3013569">First, the publication of sending the report to its superior officers, the Court of Appeals stated that on the basis of the overwhelming rate of precedence and authorities that that was an absolutely privileged communication and that they would not look behind that for any element of malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.445" offset="3097161">As far as the release to the press was concerned, they stated that that apparently had been abandoned on appeal, which I think was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.557" offset="3137599">However, they went beyond that and said, “Even if that had not been abandoned, the evidence here clearly shows that if there had been any -- the publication rather had been by Admiral Schnackenberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.947" offset="3187127">And that while Admiral Howard may have known that when he put this in channels, it would go through Admiral Schnackenberg's office and be released.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.492" offset="3221295">Nevertheless, that was an action over which he had no control with the release of that matter was one of which provided for by Navy regulations that Admiral Howard was under a duty to make this report.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.067" offset="3275630">And when he made it and put it in channels, he was not responsible and could not be held for a publication even though he might have anticipated that would be what would happen when he put it in channels.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.468" offset="3321292">On the question of release to the publications to the Congressmen, I'm a little bit unable to follow the theory of the Court except that they said that they did not believe that the doctrine of absolute liability should be expanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.535" offset="3393494">They did not dispute the evidence that this was an action performed by Admiral Howard in the carrying out of his duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.446" offset="3421184">It was a duty imposed upon him by -- I assume, by regulations and by orders of his superiors.</text>

            <text syncTime="898.591" offset="3697768">Now, that was Admiral Howard's superior and he said that was one of Admiral Howard's official duties, to furnish this.</text>

            <text syncTime="981.999" offset="4031404">It was not disputed in the court below and I would make this observation, if I might, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.818" offset="4050631">Had the court entertained any doubt about that point, that it was not one of his official duties, undoubtedly, they would have remanded it for further evidence on that -- that point because this was up on a motion for summary judgment which had been granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.810" offset="4122624">And if there had been some doubt, they would have discussed that point in their opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.611" offset="4137775">They accepted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.005" offset="4151359">It's also accepted in -- that a -- that -- the pattern in the case it seems to me indicates that the court below rather definitely accepted these findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.432" offset="4197125">Now, if Your Honors please, I would like briefly to advert to the -- in a defamation action, what elements to argue, considered simply, can now the ground here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.992" offset="4247385">In the defamation action between private parties, truth is a defense, but if the falsity has been established, malice is presumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.279" offset="4284479">And so, the burden is upon the defendant in a case where if he has not been able to establish the truth of these defamatory statements, also, to bear an over, almost overwhelming burden to offset malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.368" offset="4332857">In qualified privilege, again, truth is normally a defense, but the burden shifts and is necessary in the place of qualified privilege for the plaintiff to establish malice either by extrinsic evidence or by evidence, intrinsically, that the statement is so far so recklessly made with malice, may be drawn by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.357" offset="4432750">Both the -- the question of malice and both these instances are questions from the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.214" offset="4452185">In a situation of absolute privilege, the only question that's for examination by the Court is whether the person is an official and has acted in the course of his duties or a matter as this Court has stated in Spalding versus Vilas that has more or less relation to those duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.880" offset="4542882">Now, absolute privilege, as far as the Government is concerned, exists in three fields.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.892" offset="4570990">In the legislative field, it exists by reason of a constitutional provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.389" offset="4592933">In the judicial field and then the executive field, I think that the cases are sufficiently old that you would call them a -- a common law almost in that state, because as far as the judiciary is concerned, they date back to the days of Lord Cook.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.424" offset="4665031">It has also been extended by the judiciary -- by a judicial decision to the executive departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.475" offset="4701288">Now, the reasoning at the back of this is, not that anybody should protect a “be known” person, a malicious person or anything of that character, but that because of the -- a position that people have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.565" offset="4773595">The decisions they have to make, that they should be able to make those decisions, to utter those statements and to do the things that are necessary to carry out their duty, without feeling that they can be called to an account by any private individual who feels that they have been outraged or hurt or who alleges that they have by these actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.568" offset="4873592">That it's been remarked in the field of judicial and of the immunity of the judiciary, that cases are so bitterly contested that the losing person usually believes that the only way the decision against him can be explained is because of corruption on the part of the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.188" offset="4944123">At least in a lot of cases, so that they were open to them, they would consistently bring suit against judges in the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.378" offset="4976933">Now, in the judicial field, the absolute immunity, the extent is not only their actions, of judges in their judicial capacity, but as this Court held in Bradley versus Fisher, that it's necessary that they had -- have -- that it was necessary for them to have the jurisdiction to perform the particular act that they did, but only that they have jurisdiction, generally, in that field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.224" offset="5068257">It extends to petty and grand jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.086" offset="5079751">It extends to statements made by counsel before in a judicial proceeding and also the testimonies of witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.856" offset="5106813">There's a complete immunity in all judicial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.757" offset="5122382">Now, this Court has only passed on three occasions upon the absolute immunity insofar as the executive branch is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.519" offset="5169403">The leading case, of course, is Spalding versus Vilas, a case in which Mr. Justice Harlan spoke for the unanimous court in 1895.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.648" offset="5225932">That case involved a -- an action against the Postmaster General for a -- for effect -- would in effect be defamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.492" offset="5269295">He had sent out certain letters which they claimed had bad effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.975" offset="5291238">And then this Court reviewed all the judicial -- all the decisions involving the absolute immunity of the judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.867" offset="5330840">That drew from them what was considered by it, to be the underlying principle, and that is, that public interest was the controlling -- the matter of here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.807" offset="5374621">And that public officials, as well as the judiciary had to be able to act freely without feeling that they would have to be called for it to account on suits by private individuals for their acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.738" offset="5434284">That, not only, of course, it's been pointed out in many of these decisions, that other matters are open for this discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.370" offset="5484857">Presumably, a Cabinet officer that transcends his functions, it's something that was corrupt or evil could be removed by the President, could be impeached.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.770" offset="5538461">Lesser officials, of course, they're even more subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.360" offset="5552776">They're subject to the definite discipline of the Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.449" offset="5577122">Now, the test of these cases as the cases have evolved, and that there are a very large number of them in the lower district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.286" offset="5616515">The Courts of Appeals and then the District Courts themselves, are that -- it must -- it's a not -- that it's -- it's either in the course of the performance of their duties or for an officer to have discretion either to act or not to act where it has more or less relation to their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.131" offset="5683911">It must not be an act that's imposed on him by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.323" offset="5696658">It's enough that it's an act that he can exercise by his discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.001" offset="5711391">Now, as Your Honors, we'll proceed in this case as much an hour because here, the duty of sending these reports to members of Congress was placed upon Admiral Howard by the Navy Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.366" offset="5764786">Now, I would just like to advert to one fact here in our -- I just checked our index.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.422" offset="5809089">In 10 of these cases involving absolute immunity, certiorari has been denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.468" offset="5829256">I know that there at least 10 or 15 more of them where it's been denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.093" offset="5843780">I know that that ordinarily does not indicate a feeling on the part of this Court, but I do submit that this case as you can steadily have been counting that this Court since the decision in Spalding versus Vilas, and that the decisions have been uniformly denied with one exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.158" offset="5912012">And that was the case of -- that came up, Yaselli versus Goff came up from the Second Circuit, it involved an action for malicious prosecution against the Special Assistant to the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.362" offset="5968854">These are very acts in opinion by the Second Circuit in 12 F.2d.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.174" offset="5992051">It was affirmed by this Court in a per curiam opinion in which they relied upon only two cases that was Bradley versus Fisher and Alzua versus Johnson, both cases hearing the immunity of the judicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.805" offset="6038549">The other thing assigned in this case as a matter of support in this Court was the Court's recent decision in the last term, in Barr versus Matteo, where this Court vacated a decision of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and sent the matter back for a decision as the Court could do so on the question of qualified privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.984" offset="6127261">In that case, however, there had been a complete record made.</text>

            <text syncTime="2044.544" offset="8281527">But ordinarily they only deal with the discretionary situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.139" offset="8299917">I don't know of any instance where it was a man's absolute duty to do something that has been before the Courts insofar as, certainly, not as far as this Court is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.692" offset="8338160">Ordinarily, any official that performs an act is either guilty of a trespass or may commit a tort upon a private individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.868" offset="8370866">If he were a private individual that would be actionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.748" offset="8382360">His defense, ordinarily, is that he is acting pursuant either to a valid law or valid regulation of his superior.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.309" offset="8412557">When he shows that, he normally is immune from any kind of a tort or a trespass action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.618" offset="8433873">And that's one of the reasons you practically never find anything of this character because ordinarily, there's a number of cases that upheld, the Ainsworth -- De Arnaud versus Ainsworth is the next, in Lynn O'Connor case in the -- in the lower courts where they have held that because of the complexities of the modern departments, it's impossible for the head to exercise most of his duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.122" offset="8539826">He has to delegate them to his subordinates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.493" offset="8549334">But the acts of his subordinates are usually the acts of the Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.329" offset="8564694">Now, that basically is the reasoning which deals with the problem that you raised, Mr. Justice Stewart that there has been restricted in this Court or the only case they have dealt with was the head of the department.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.268" offset="8616417">I would assume that an ordinary assistant secretary has more people under him and more duties now than the head of the department had in 1895.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.349" offset="8660720">There's been that much increase in the complexity of Government operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.496" offset="8677334">And I think the reason in back of it is the thing that should be of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.860" offset="8694784">And, that is, that you look not at the titular job that the person holds but the duties that they are intended to perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.230" offset="8728325">And I think that that is the point at which the decision should be made as to whether there should be absolute immunity or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.599" offset="8765733">Now, of course, again on the question of defamation, we all know that anybody that publishes it or transmits it is liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.383" offset="8796871">For example, when a man has a publicity agent, public, whether he release these things through, that man is also guilty of publishing but no one ever treat that as anything except the acts of the head of the department and the person that directed him to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.407" offset="8856952">Even a newsboy that carries and sells newspaper that contains a libelous article is technically guilty of a publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.679" offset="8882134">No one bothers with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.856" offset="8886836">You usually look at the responsible person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.536" offset="8897494">But there's a lot of technicalities in this field that I think that can be over exaggerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.403" offset="8917034">I would like to express the fact that at least as far as the field of absolute privilege is concerned, we think it should be examined -- it should be dealt with as a matter of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.855" offset="8954755">It has to do with what as a matter of federal interest and the desire is the balancing of two equities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.749" offset="8986415">The right of a private individual to be secure in their reputation, that's as far as the defamation case is concerned, but to this, of course, would extend to the malicious prosecution cases, false imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.001" offset="9027375">There's a great number of those in the books as an addition to this particular form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.175" offset="9048064">And that the relationship, that balance that should be made as far as federal officials is concerned, as far as the federal judiciary is concerned, is a matter that should be decided on the basis of federal law and not from the varying concepts of 48 different States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.904" offset="9119013">The second thing is, especially in anything that has to do with defamation, it should have a uniform rule because a press release from Washington will be published perhaps in all 48 States of the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.802" offset="9170631">And, of course, you may maintain a suit for defamation any place that it's published.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.772" offset="9186408">So, you would get divergent views and divergent results.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.002" offset="9203336">And I would like to call attention to one fact that I think is quite disturbing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.048" offset="9223607">I would see no reason or any basis on which you can distinguish, that is on the basic reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.937" offset="9247117">The degree of it might be entirely different between the immunity of the judiciary and the immunity of the executive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.936" offset="9267075">It's all based on a basis of public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.184" offset="9280136">Now, if you applied state law to the executive branch, I would think by the same sign and token, you would have to apply state law to the judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.726" offset="9326320">And yet there's a decision by the Supreme Court -- the Court of Appeals of New York which is then cited in the opinion below where they held that the judge can send a copy of his opinion to West Publishing Company under the New York Law Journal that transcended the duties of his office and he was guilty of publication of that and it could be held in an action, at least it was not ordinarily demurrable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.738" offset="9422346">Now, I don't think that it would be a very good idea to have the federal judiciary subjected to suits for defamation if there happened to be some statement in one of the opinion and it was a frivolous argument put in by an attorney and that it would have been published in the New York Law Journal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.552" offset="9489533">And that would be -- that -- I'm giving that as a concrete example of what could happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.080" offset="9507715">In other words, I think in the field of absolute immunity, it should be definitely governed by federal law and whether -- whether different considerations apply to qualified privilege, we do not need to consider because this case is here only on the question of absolute immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3210.759" offset="12946369">Now, it is true that the affidavits in this case state that it was his duty to send this report to the Admiral in charge but they cite no order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.554" offset="13005615">They cite no regulation or anything that shows that that is his duty nor in the affidavit which is the Navy or -- or what he says is the Navy policy, to send this to members of Congress of all memorandums.</text>
