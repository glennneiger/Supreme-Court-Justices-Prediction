            <text syncTime="248.982" offset="1099316">Now I should mention that the statute also does provide that if the final fee is not paid within the six months period, which expires May 25th, then the Commissioner of Patents in his discretion on a showing of good reason why, may accept it anytime within the next year after the expiration of that period.</text>

            <text syncTime="796.186" offset="3288168">Now that is a matter of destroying the trade secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.341" offset="3304782">Second is whether if the Act is construed to so authorize, it should be held to that extent to be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.001" offset="3351385">Now the facts briefly are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.326" offset="3368626">In 1942, the plaintiff made a basic or a prior invention and this dual temperature process which is covered by an issued patent and that earlier invention, the respondents have perfect liberty to publish and that's not involved in this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.101" offset="3443754">It was after June 1946, while he was self employed that the petitioner made the invention, which is involved in the present controversy and in referring to it I will try to refer to it as the new invention so as to distinguish it from the earlier one.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.525" offset="3517524">This new invention, the petitioner offered to disclose to the Atomic Energy Commission in confidence in 1948 and the letter by which that offer was made is attached as appendix I to the brief -- to the reply brief for the petitioner which was just filed yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.172" offset="3620028">This confidential disclosure was of course made I should say pursuant to this offer in 1948, the confidential disclosure was made in 1949 and of course the purpose of it was to enable the Atomic Energy Commission to determine whether it wished to use the process for the production of heavy water.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.618" offset="3729847">No rights in the invention being transferred as part of this submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.333" offset="3756701">The Atomic Energy Commission then did decide to use the new invention for the production of heavy water.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.335" offset="3788675">And from 1950 to 1953, the petitioner rendered services to the Atomic Energy Commission under special contracts which reserved his rights to the invention in controversy, and which provided that he would file a patent application for the invention, which he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.141" offset="3875924">Now that application was put under a secrecy order by the patent office at the instance of the Atomic Energy Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.544" offset="3905599">And the Atomic Energy Commission also refused to allow the secrecy order to be modified, so that the inventor could file corresponding applications abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.310" offset="3952619">That situation adhered until February 1, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.068" offset="3971636">On February 1, 1957 the secrecy order was rescinded and at the same time the Atomic Energy Commission threatened to publish the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.392" offset="4024926">We maintain that this subject matter is petitioner's trade secret up until the time that patent issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.840" offset="4054706">The petitioner at once sought assurances that the publication would not be made, but he could not obtain such assurances.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.911" offset="4102980">He filed this suit to prevent the respondents from destroying his property by publishing his trade secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.844" offset="4142791">The District Court in proceedings on the motion for preliminary injunction overruled respondent's contention that this was an unconsented suit against the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.436" offset="4185109">However, based on affidavits of certain alleged disseminations which are produced by the respondents, the District Court did deny the motion for preliminary injunction on the ground of mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.222" offset="4240280">On appeal, the Court of Appeals did not reach the point of mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.554" offset="4253550">It ruled that the Atomic Energy Act authorized the respondents to make this publication and that therefore the contract did not -- and it also mentioned that the complaint had not set out in its opinion the statutory limitations which denied such authority and on that basis it ordered the case to be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.745" offset="4362324">The petitioner moved to amend the complaint to specify statutory limitations and also to specify the presence of a constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.886" offset="4410911">Now this motion was denied and we came up for the first time to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.056" offset="4431600">In the per curiam in December 1957 this Court granted certiorari, vacated the judgment and orders below and remanded the case with instructions to enter the amendments and decide the issues raised by the petitioners appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.967" offset="4495235">On remand, the Court of Appeals again held that the Atomic Energy Act authorized the publication and further held that the Constitution didn't forbid this, and then directed that the amended complaint be dismissed for failure to state a cause of action on which relief could be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.868" offset="4566810">Now we maintain that the instant certiorari was granted to review these rulings and also the ruling of the District Court which was not reached by the Court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.537" offset="4613517">The petitioner's first contention, which I will discuss after I mention the others, is that the respondents do not have the statutory authority to publish the plaintiff's trade secret without his consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.595" offset="4665762">There are three points on that which I will not enumerate until I get to that part of the discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.641" offset="4693974">Our second contention, which Mr. Edwards will discuss, is that the District Court ruling of mootness was improper and was not established by the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.189" offset="4740159">These above issues of course are raised by the questions presented in the petition as granted and hence are in our opinion properly before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.758" offset="4782373">It appears to us from the respondents' brief that the respondents have abandoned the position that they have statutory authority to publish this subject matter with or without the petitioner's consent, which they urged always previously heretofore and now are attempting to rely or attempting to raise a new issue on the proposition that somehow they are trying to find an implied consent to this publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.327" offset="4908701">Of course they have tried to rely on an implied contract, of course there was an implied contract, that they could use this matter, subject to compensation as far as the use was concerned, but that's a different thing from destroying the trade secret which is the subject of the contract up to the time when a patent they issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1428.589" offset="5817762">There are three ways in which the government or government official can get information in confidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.593" offset="5857782">One way is from the inspection of a patent application under the Secrecy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.275" offset="5884426">When that's done, the respondents now come along here and they say we don't claim now and they pretend that they never claimed before, that they would have any right to publish it if they got it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.794" offset="5938552">Another way is if the Act, the Atomic Energy Act or other appropriate act called for a report to be made of the invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.580" offset="5981706">The respondents in their brief now come along and they say, we don't say that we have any right to publish under those circumstances, yes we would get it under confidence then and then they pretend that they never heard to the contrary below, well we contend that they did urge to the contrary below and even up before this Court, that is pretty fully set forth in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.074" offset="6063626">Now the third way they can get the subject matter and it will be noted that also in connection with getting it from inspection of a patent application, but that law sort of -- that secrecy law rather adds to the old patent infringement so called jurisdiction or patent eminent may license jurisdiction of the Court of Claims, which adhered only when one the subject matter was used by or for the government after the patent issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.085" offset="6199672">Now under the Secrecy Act it carries the time when the government may look upon the -- and then it may look to the government for compensation for use, back to the time when the government got access to this application and got it that way as a trade secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.098" offset="6259754">And I believe there are cases, one of them is the Smith case cited in our reply brief, which have held that a patent -- that an invention remains a trade secret throughout the pendency of the application for patent on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.623" offset="6325896">Now the third way that it can be gotten is for the inventor who or owner of the trade secret to disclose it under some sort of a contract to the recipient of the disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.610" offset="6405831">In this case the disclosure was to be made for the purpose of enabling the trade secret to be used by the Atomic Energy Commission for the prevention of heavy water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.450" offset="6457135">And certainly didn't contemplate destruction of the trade secret, because if you destroy -- it wouldn't be any point to making a contract with respect to subject matter which was convey immediately the right to destroy the subject matter under which the contract was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.157" offset="6515963">Recall that until a pattern issues to take the place of your trade secret the only rights that an inventor has are his rights of secrecy, in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.848" offset="6554728">And it seems to us that whether those -- whether the right to use this as obtained under the Patent Act Secrecy Provisions, or whether it's obtained under a reporting provision of the Atomic Energy Act, or whether its obtained through a patriotic presentation of the subject matter with a reservation of full patent or full rights in the subject matter by a citizen is completely immaterial so far as any right to publish and destroy the race of the contract is concerned, do I make that point clear?</text>

            <text syncTime="2131.979" offset="8631254">If you have a contract and there is a breach of that contract or if you have a contract and there is a provision for a promise to pay in that contract, on the part of the government agent who is authorized by the statute to do the act in question, then or if he is authorized by an eminent domain statute, then you of course have a cause of action in the Court of Claims as long as the act done does not sound in tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.996" offset="8791333">Now if the act done is not authorized by statute or an eminent, that is an eminent to main statute or by a contract consent then of course it would sound in tort, and it wouldn't be actionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.883" offset="8874924">Now it comes of the other fact that we have the Tort Claims Act in which for certain times in torts the government says yes it will be liable and consent to be sued, but that isn't this sort of a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.569" offset="8925602">Now also here we have the further fact that an invention like a copyright, like a writing, this is an intellectual property, you have rights as long as you keep it secret to get patents, in various places for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.951" offset="9003133">It's unique, once it's disclosed the trade secret is gone.</text>

            <text syncTime="2579.363" offset="10420851">The initial contracts, the first three or four merely said that in substance that the petitioner was going to tell them what this process was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.831" offset="10462647">Then as Mr. Houghton has indicated, after they had revealed the process to them and they had decided to use it, he was hired to advise them on how it could be handled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.418" offset="10509040">In those contracts, there is a specific reservation in each of the four, either right in there or by reference, there is a reservation of the right, all rights that he has under the Atomic Energy Act or otherwise.</text>

            <text syncTime="2628.927" offset="10619068">I direct the Court's attention to Rules 41 d2 and 40.3.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.794" offset="10654595">Those rules specify what issues are before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.650" offset="10678000">This case has been in litigation for sometime now and this on the petitioner's brief filed about a month ago was the very first time they ever raised this issue of consent.</text>

            <text syncTime="4129.965" offset="16623261">The basic complaint that was made, the basic plea that was made to the Atomic Energy Commission was, that had there never been any secrecy restrictions, petitioner would have had one year after he filed his domestic patent application, within which he could apply in foreign countries and be subject to certain priorities and protections under the International Convention.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carleton U. Edwards II</label>
            <text syncTime="5560.863" offset="22346794">Id it please the court, I should like to say at the outset at this time that unfortunately this litigation has consumed a great portion of the petitioner's effort and that of his counsel dealing over the period of these months.</text>
            <text syncTime="5584.362" offset="22440835">This case as I have said before, I think the sole issue in this case is whether the respondents have the power and authority to make this publication, I think that's the one big issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5598.549" offset="22497573">If they don't there is no adequate remedy here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5601.742" offset="22510320">If they do, then we are out of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5604.154" offset="22520038">There isn't any middle ground, I don't believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="5607.320" offset="22532681">Now there is tremendous public interest in this case as evidenced by the brief filed by the amici in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5615.215" offset="22564237">The Engineers Joint Council has amongst its membership and membership and the associations which it -- which composes 250,000 scientists and engineers, the American Chemical Society has 80,000 chemists.</text>
            <text syncTime="5632.622" offset="22633827">The American Chemical Society in their brief said the importance of these questions of the members of the American Chemical Society cannot be overstated in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5640.979" offset="22667264">And they are talking about the authority whether or not the respondents have the authority to do what they are trying to do, something they have gotten confidence and now they propose to give it away and destroying his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5655.662" offset="22725987">The Engineers Joint Council said in their brief since the Engineers Joint Council represents such a vast number of our nations' engineers and the case at bar present a serious threat to the fundamental rights of our country's engineers and scientist.</text>
            <text syncTime="5667.372" offset="22772903">Consent was obtained to file this brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5671.381" offset="22788890">This case involves a very important issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="5674.627" offset="22801847">Our government agents and particular the respondents here are going to be able to get something from somebody incompetent such as has done here and then over his objection destroy it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5689.784" offset="22862555">Now Mr. Sand's contends that they had a statutory duty to make this public.</text>
            <text syncTime="5696.208" offset="22888155">That statute says encourage, permit and encourage publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="5700.919" offset="22907068">That statute is talking about information that they own, not information owned by someone else such as in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5709.667" offset="22942072">Mr. Sands contends that they paid him to tell them how to incorporate this process into his plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="5720.334" offset="22984704">They paid him what in amounts was to time for -- I mean payment for the time that he devoted to this or informing them of what this was.</text>
            <text syncTime="5730.971" offset="23027231">And he didn't pay them -- I mean, he wasn't paid for the destruction of this right, this trade secret which is a valuable trade secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="5740.843" offset="23066728">Mr. Sands contends that all he reserved was his right to compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5749.978" offset="23103300">They, the respondents themselves in their brief, in opposition to the petition, admitted, it says petitioner reserve, however any invention rights in his alleged new process.</text>
            <text syncTime="5762.752" offset="23154395">In the brief that they filed, the latest brief they said it is agreed that in the course of his employment petitioner reserved any invention rights which he may have in the improvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5775.564" offset="23205595">Now when he, he reserved any rights, one of the principal rights in a trade secret is the right to secrecy and it is not their right and they cannot show anywhere, where they contracted, negotiated and obtained the right to make this publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="5793.959" offset="23279156">Mr. Sand speaks of serious public consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="5799.589" offset="23301726">Actually there's very little evidence in the record as to all these claims of what, how terribly they have been affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="5807.691" offset="23334118">Their own pleadings show they don't, in forty out of a thousand documents is this process involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5816.359" offset="23368808">And I would like to also point out the Court in this case had -- no answer has been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5820.393" offset="23384900">There has been a verified compliant filed in this case and a verified amended complaint and for the purposes of this action I think all of those contentions have to be taken as admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5835.606" offset="23445817">And further in connection with the reservation of rights in all of the four contracts as I said Mr. Spevack had with the respondent, it stated, “it is understood and agreed that neither this agreement nor any compensation paid here under, nor any other provision of Article 5 above shall apply with respect to or affect any rights under the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 as amended or otherwise and that the contractor may now or hereafter have in and to such improvement made between aforesaid dates.</text>
            <text syncTime="5874.461" offset="23601194">He reserved all rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5875.649" offset="23606000">All he did was to tell them how this thing worked and then help them to incorporate it.</text>
