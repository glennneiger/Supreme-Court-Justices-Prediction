            <text syncTime="31.125" offset="227871">During the argument before the United States Supreme Court today, the question was raised as to whether in your case there was a difference between the standards of national interest and clearly consistent with the interest of national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.142" offset="283982">I'm authorized to inform you that the acting Secretary of Defense in determining on December 31st, 1958 that you were eligible for clearance for access to defense information classified secret did not intend by its reference to the national interest to differentiate your status from that of all other employees eligible for such clearance including employees as to whom a board has made determination that access at such level is clearly consistent with the interest of national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.153" offset="408012">In other words, your clearance has been determined to be clearly consistent with the interest of national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.072" offset="439672">Mr. Rauh has responded to that as of April 1st referring to that fact that he telegraphed the Secretary on January 10th asking if the Secretary's action as of the prior date amounted to certain findings in regard to Mr. Taylor and the findings are reversing the earlier findings, withdrawing false charges, announcing that Mr. Taylor has never been a member of the Communist Party, never paid Communist Party dues and never attended Communist Party meetings and so forth and establishing that he has been truthful and so asserting.</text>

            <text syncTime="612.752" offset="2554337">But there is nothing in the record that he was not except his own testimony and his own witnesses are confidential.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.040" offset="2595506">Now, in regard to the question of Mr. Justice Douglas about compensation from the time he had been out of work, I'm advised that he will be fully compensated that his counsel have already asked for the forms that he could get his compensation, the difference between what he will receive and what he should have received if he had been employed during that period and that this is not a special treatment on Mr. Taylor, but the regulations in Section 26 or I guess it's paragraph 26 on page 32 of the supplement, expressly provide for monetary restitution in this kind of a case and he is to be paid the amount of that difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.990" offset="2811382">Now, in regard to the job position, I should like to clarify that.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.398" offset="2836982">That was an idea of the Department of Justice as trying to put in further element of consideration for the need of access in the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.332" offset="2888704">And when it was presented and examined on a working level in the department that have the administration of the program, it was found that it was not workable and this is the reason that it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.812" offset="2922663">It was found that with the Bell Aircraft Company when they made a reduction enforced under the seniority program which is generally called bumping that with a reduction of 4,500 members of the union, it involved 26,000 shifts of position of the employees so that you would be busy in the government examining on a job basis continuously because every time that someone was eliminated, a man could move into that position and be at a different job and instead of being like it is now where you would have a clearance, he would have to go through the procedures every few days or weeks depending upon the situation and it also would involve the administrative problem and it did not seem at all practical and also would put a burden upon the employees that was not realistic and would be a hindrance to the proper development carrying on the defense program.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.871" offset="3226833">Same is indicated by the fact that there is a 20% turnover in this company of employees, we were advised.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.051" offset="3267584">And in view of that, the job position movement in which every time there was turnover, the man, if it was a problem of seniority has the right to bid for the better position would be constantly subjected to that kind of situation and that's why the idea of a job position element of consideration was abandoned.</text>

            <text syncTime="1500.397" offset="6105004">Now, I think I may have not been as clear yesterday as I would have liked to have been and may have confused the difference between a request -- a suit for money damages and a suit for equitable and declaratory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.857" offset="6178774">In a suit for money damages where payment of the damages is made in full, where the person has been fully compensated then of course the case is moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.793" offset="6234572">In however, suit for equitable and declaratory relief, future protection is as significant as the immediate problem, and this Court has recognized time and again that where there is a likelihood of recurrence then the case is not moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.943" offset="6319104">Take Walling against Helvering where the man stopped his wage in our law valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.383" offset="6340942">Take the Grant case where the man resigned as the director.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.363" offset="6356825">Unless you're going to say it's a double standard and the Government can stop and there's no -- and there's still a danger of recurrence and it's different with a private party but this Court rejected the double standard in the Southern Pacific Terminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.862" offset="6418787">And so, we get back to this fact, is there a likelihood of recurrence and to that, I would like to devote the remaining time here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.787" offset="6462568">Now, Mr. Rankin suggested this morning that the practice is to wipe this information clean when in fact a man is cleared.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.002" offset="6523382">Why that an amazing statement really in this Court, because of the fact that this Court has three cases proving the exact opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.091" offset="6583777">The first case, of course was Peters against Hobby where Mr. Peters, on the same evidence, the same evidence in which he was cleared with was subsequently used to find him guilty and it came to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.116" offset="6647829">The case of Mr. Service which came to the Court, the identical evidence had found him clean four times, was used the fifth time to find him guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.256" offset="6688371">And finally, and this it seems to me has the most complete answer, is the Greene case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.889" offset="6722957">In the very Greene case the same evidence -- the case is only here because the same evidence which once was used to find him innocent was later used to find him guilty.</text>
