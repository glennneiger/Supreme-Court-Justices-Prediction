            <label>Mr. James A. Wilcox</label>
            <text syncTime="11.151" offset="147937">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.585" offset="169671">The question in this case here on certiorari to the Ninth Circuit is whether in the absence of any due process or other constitutional question, a District Court has the jurisdiction to review and pass upon the grounds relied upon by the National Railroad Adjustment Board in denying respondent's claim of wrongful discharge, looked at from another view is the denial award of the National Railroad Adjustment Board, final and binding as Congress said it would be in the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.689" offset="322121">Also involved here is the question of whether respondent's election to proceed administrate -- under the administrative remedy of the Act, bars his subsequent action for damages in the course.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.323" offset="384711">The facts in this case are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.479" offset="397249">They are these: Respondent Price was employed by the petitioner Union Pacific as a brakeman at Las Vegas, Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.552" offset="445628">Back in 1949, in July, he was called to work in about nine in the evening and he was told to “dead-head” to a small point in California, Nipton, 56 miles away.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.655" offset="501948">Upon arriving at Nipton, he called his superior officer, the train dispatcher, and he was instructed to stay at Nipton for a few hours and then to work as a swing brakeman on a train coming back in to Las Vegas.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.472" offset="569240">Mr. Price, the respondent objected to those instructions.</text>

            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="121.034" offset="587525">What is a “swing brakeman”?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_a_wilcox" startTime="122.350" stopTime="334.769">
            <label>Mr. James A. Wilcox</label>
            <text syncTime="122.350" offset="592750">A swing brakeman, sir, is a brakeman that is required we say in the railroad industry unnecessarily but it's required under the state law, the -- the extra brakeman.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.791" offset="638516">It is required under Nevada law.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.722" offset="654294">Mr. Price objected this instruction of staying there, this three to four hours and he asserted that it was in violation of a provision in the collective bargaining agreement between the Union Pacific and the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen who represented for purposes of the Railway Labor Act, the man employed as brakeman on our property.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.275" offset="744469">He was again told to stay at that point but Price took the matters into his own hands and proceeded back to Las Vegas.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.423" offset="781040">As a consequence, he was charged with being insubordinate and pursuant to the provisions of the agreement, a hiring or investigation was scheduled to be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.417" offset="837047">Price was directed to appear at this hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.266" offset="848436">Now, this hearing was twice postponed and when it was finally held, Mr. Price did not show up.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.314" offset="872678">The hearing was, however, held in his absence, evidence taken and put in and taken down in short hand and a transcript prepared of that insubordinate action.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.313" offset="920639">Following that, Price was discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.656" offset="934013">This was in July of 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.624" offset="945821">Subsequently, Price has requested the Brotherhood to handle his grievance over his alleged wrongful discharge with the carrier and sought there in his reinstatement would pay for all time loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.510" offset="1009455">That dispute was not settled on the property but was ultimately referred at Mr. Price's election to the National Railroad Adjustment Board pursuant to the provisions of 3 First (i) of the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.870" offset="1070895">The claim at the Board was a claim for reinstatement with back pay, premised upon an alleged wrongful discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.620" offset="1109870">The claim was handled in a usual manner at the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.190" offset="1124080">At that -- before that tribunal, only Mr. Price urged two basic contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.567" offset="1149680">First, he said that his disobedience, his failure to follow instructions was not insubordination.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.087" offset="1179669">It was justified because we had no right to make -- to command him to stay there.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.763" offset="1198373">The other point that he had was that we violated the labor contract in holding the hearing in his absence.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.851" offset="1234735">The Board deadlocked on that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.490" offset="1245288">Ultimately, under the provisions of 3 First (l), a referee was called in, a neutral person whom Congress has said, shall sit with the division and make an award.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.515" offset="1297429">On June 25, 1952, the Board issued its award or decision, as it's known.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.691" offset="1330134">And that award was simply 'Claim denied.'</text>
            <text syncTime="311.957" offset="1351241">The Board also made some findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.545" offset="1361586">And in those findings, the Board did discuss the question of Mr. Price's failure to follow his instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.340" offset="1392724">And the Board stated and I'm quoting, “Price, was found to have wilfully disobeyed his orders.”</text>
            <text syncTime="328.795" offset="1418533">And the Board then said, “This was insubordination and merited discipline.”</text>

            <text syncTime="344.114" offset="1479868">It is the first paragraph there.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.515" offset="1493452">There is a preceding sentence where the Board said, “If the carrier is to have efficient operations on its railroad, its employees must be relied upon to obey instructions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="358.112" offset="1535770">The Board then proceeded in the balance of its findings to hold that the carrier did not violate the agreement in holding the hearing in Mr. Price's absence.</text>

            <text syncTime="412.664" offset="1754049">The request or the petition for an interpretation was made prior to the petition for certiorari being filed here.</text>

            <text syncTime="447.544" offset="1893543">Following the issuance of that award, Mr. Price, the petitioner, took no -- made no effort to challenge that board award on any constitutional or procedural or statutory basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="490.479" offset="2065324">He filed this action which was a diversity action in the District Court in Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.422" offset="2093014">He sought damages for wrongful discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.651" offset="2105971">The carrier, the petitioner filed an answer setting forth the award of the Board and asserting that it was final and binding under Section 3 First (m) of the Act which provides that awards shall be final and binding on both parties except insofar as they shall contain a money award.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.077" offset="2191653">I might state that there's no question here that this was not a money award.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.861" offset="2210774">It is pretty well settled that a denial of a claim for money is not a money award.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.443" offset="2241181">And we also assert -- alleged that the claim was barred under the doctrine of election of remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.580" offset="2273677">Our motion for a summary judgment was granted and the respondent appealed to the Court of Appeals where the -- that Court reversed in a two to one decision, Judge Healy dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.785" offset="2334490">However, for the purposes of this case, we think Judge Healy was also wrong as far as the law is concerned which I'll explain a little later.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.877" offset="2370853">The Court's opinion is a little difficult to rationalize.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.392" offset="2384959">The Bo -- that Court recognize that the Board had made an award in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.996" offset="2403349">As a matter of fact, the Court itself said, “The Adjustment Board denied Price's claim in its entirety."</text>
            <text syncTime="583.233" offset="2436263">Now, the claim was for reinstatement and back pay and it was based upon wrongful discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.635" offset="2457893">It was that claim that the court below said, “Was denied in its entirety.”</text>
            <text syncTime="594.803" offset="2482552">It also recognized that this was simply a collateral attack on the board award.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.512" offset="2505435">It also recognized the finality language which I've just read to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.450" offset="2525184">But it avoided the effect of that finality language by adopting a very unusual argument advanced by respondent that the Board had failed to pass upon the merits of Price's dispute with the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.510" offset="2577429">In order to adopt that argument, the court below, first of all, had to amend the Railway Labor Act and they did it in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.364" offset="2608880">They said that an award of the Board is final and binding if it represents an adjudication on the merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.646" offset="2637928">Then having open the door or carved out an area that they could review the Board's award, they walked through it and said, “Let's decide what were the merits.”</text>
            <text syncTime="643.275" offset="2676485">They not only reviewed the Board's findings, they went to the submissions that were filed to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.443" offset="2705115">They found that two questions were presented as I've outlined.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.908" offset="2719013">Was Price's disobedience justified and was the holding of the hearing in his absence a violation of the agreement?</text>
            <text syncTime="666.578" offset="2769690">They concluded that the question as to Price's disobedience being justified was the merit of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.416" offset="2809083">And they said that the Board has misunderstood the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.656" offset="2822040">The Board has misconstrued Price's submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.689" offset="2834160">They even went so far as to try to find out what the Board believed.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.937" offset="2855163">And that word, “believe” is in their opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.769" offset="2866448">They held that since the Board did not pass upon what they determine to be the merit, that the award was not final and binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.100" offset="2899780">Now, it is significant to know that the court below is very, very candid.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.288" offset="2920573">They said that this question was simply a dispute over the grounds relied upon by the Board in reaching its denial award which all parties could see to have been unambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.383" offset="2980864">Now, I just submit that in its quest for the merit, its unnecessarily search for the merit, the court below confused arguments advanced by the respondent, Price, in support of his claim with the ultimate question which he presented to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.194" offset="3052126">And the ultimate question was, “Could Price be reinstated with pay?”</text>
            <text syncTime="741.200" offset="3068217">And the Board said, “No.”</text>
            <text syncTime="743.824" offset="3078666">Now, anyone of the arguments that were advanced by Price, have they been accepted by the Board?</text>
            <text syncTime="749.656" offset="3101968">An award sustaining his claim for back pay and reinstatement would have been an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.133" offset="3131956">Justice Brennan has brought up this question of the interpretation subsequent to the Court of Appeals decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.013" offset="3167378">The petitioner did file a petition with the Adjustment Board pursuant to 3 First (m) which provide that in case a dispute arises involving an interpretation of the award, the division of the Board upon request of either party, shall interpret the award in the light of the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.569" offset="3249612">Now, we asserted in the court below that if respondent, Price was serious in his contention that the Board had failed to consider the merits of his discharge, then all he had to do was refer the matter back to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.289" offset="3304573">The court below rejected that contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.308" offset="3320560">In the interpretation which the Board issued following this Court's grant of certiorari, and that interpretation incidentally was rendered by the Board in this -- as composed exactly at the time the award was made namely, the referee, A. Langley (Inaudible), was a member of that Board and sat as 11-man Board in interpreting its award.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.535" offset="3417527">I just like to point out that the Board stated that its award -- that the sentence in its award, “This was insubordination and merited discipline,” demonstrated that the Board had considered and rejected the argument that Price's refusal to follow orders was justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.747" offset="3498402">The Board went ahead and said that that award constituted a final disposition of that dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="867.397" offset="3573008">The court below relied upon a case by the name of (Inaudible) where there was an award that was not clear and it was a District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.318" offset="3620655">And in that case, the Court said, “I'm not sure as to the meaning of this award.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.957" offset="3639150">It's incumbent upon the parties to get an interpretation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="888.133" offset="3655868">Now that case was cited as one of the authorities by the court below and by respondent -- by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.976" offset="3683244">But that court said, “We should get an interpretation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="898.599" offset="3697768">Then the other reason that actually militated for this, is at the time Mr. Price refused to follow the instructions, we were in rather serious labor difficulties with the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen over the question of our -- keeping this men at Nipton.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.728" offset="3770284">And they are asserting that it was in violation of the local contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.028" offset="3783450">In fact, the National Mediation Board had taken a hold of the matter and they come into the case only when it represents a rather serious problem that being a major dispute as distinguished from a minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.120" offset="3835904">It was in that atmosphere that Mr. Price decided to take matters into his own hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.167" offset="3856071">And I will say that things were just a little warm for a little while over this entire matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.664" offset="3878013">The matter was referred to the Board and our management was crazy after receiving the Court of Appeals decision with an order of the Court which set that award aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.090" offset="3927751">Now, as a matter of policy, we decided that it would be best to get the Board's own interpretation of its award to exhaust everything that we should do and we did just that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1639.670" offset="6662040">In this case, Mr. Price was sent from Las Vegas to Nipton and this is about 56 miles and I believe 9:25 in the evening.</text>

            <text syncTime="1762.384" offset="7152933">His job was to protect the train at 4 o'clock if that was necessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1769.131" offset="7179891">But the chronology with respect to the investigation is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.881" offset="7194937">This occurred on the morning of the 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.673" offset="7210088">At the time, the Brotherhood and the railroad were in controversy, because the railroad had just started to drop the swing brakeman about two weeks before, out here at Nipton in the desert.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.218" offset="7256273">As a result, the matter has been taken to the National Mediation Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.199" offset="7272155">And on the 15th of July, an agreement was entered into between the Railroad and the Brotherhood that the railroad would no longer put swing brakemen out here in Nipton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.772" offset="7318444">They would use the old place they had, Chelsea which was a station nearby.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.202" offset="7336208">Now, on the morning of the 16th, the day following this agreement, Mr. Price gets a notice of hearing from the Assistant Superintendent here in Las Vegas saying that's going to be you're suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.988" offset="7379362">There will be an investigation and hearing tomorrow on your insubordination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.038" offset="7395558">He showed up the next morning and he said, “I don't have a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.238" offset="7408306">My witness is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.164" offset="7412067">A railroad man and he had gone out.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.862" offset="7418859">And the notice of investigation which he received said, “You may present witnesses at your own expense.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.205" offset="7440175">In other words, you'd have to pay the man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.207" offset="7448221">He was granted a continuance until the following day when he appeared and asked for another extension because the representative that he wanted to have is Brotherhood Chairman was -- had been sent out by the railroad the night before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.264" offset="7496391">The same Assistant Superintendent said, “You'll be here this afternoon at 2 o'clock and you get another representative at 2 o'clock.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.115" offset="7523871">Mr. Price wasn't there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.393" offset="7528991">A hearing was held by the assistant representative, no transcript of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.332" offset="7548740">All we have is a series of questions and answers guided by the Assistant Clerk and the Assistant Superintendent -- to the clerk the Assistant Superintendent does all records that went up later on to the Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.260" offset="7600462">As a matter of fact the -- this little transcript indicates that after these witnesses at least apparently were heard and apparently subsequently reduced in writing some form of these questions and answers, the same Assistant Superintendent said being there know what -- this is here for Mr. Price, no evidence and the investigation is closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.891" offset="7682905">That is the sum total of the hearing which ultimately here appears to have so far deprived Mr. Price valuable contract rights which he has under the collective agreement.</text>
