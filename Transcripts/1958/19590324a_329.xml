            <label>Mr. Thomas J. McDermott</label>
            <text syncTime="29.639" offset="221915">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.796" offset="230588">This case is here upon a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals to the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.762" offset="258382">This case involves a determination by the Labor Board that certain employee representation committees are labor organizations within the meaning of Section 2 (5), the Taft-Hartley Act and that the respondents, referred to herein as Cabot, dominated, interfered with, assisted and supported those committees in violation of Section 82 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.249" offset="356394">The court below while accepting the Board's finding that Cabot in fact dominated, interfered with, assisted and supported the committees in question, disagreed with the Board that the committees are labor organizations and therefore, the Court found that no violation of Section 82 had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.980" offset="443329">Hence, the basic and only question before this Court is whether the committees are labor organizations within the meaning of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.157" offset="480005">The essential facts of the case may be briefly stated as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.610" offset="497768">During World War II, an employee representation committee was established at each of Cabot's plants or installations in line with the work production Board's encouragement of joint labor management committees to promote production and efficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.864" offset="562866">The employee representation system was continued after the war and a committee was set up for each new plant acquired by Cabot.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.455" offset="597243">The committees have no formal organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.362" offset="608841">There are no membership requirements, no dues and no officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.282" offset="628485">Organization is limited to the election once a year by the employees, committeemen and their alternates.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.154" offset="659937">The committees' bylaws provide that the purposes of the committee are to bring about a better understanding between management and the employee and to provide a definite procedure for considering employees ideas with respect to problems of mutual interest, such as safety, increased efficiency in production and the improvement or the encouragement of ingenuity and initiative.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.269" offset="760456">The bylaws further provide the committees shall meet at regular monthly and special meetings called by the management, make recommendations on employee suggestions, submitted under Cabot suggestion plant and handle grievances in nonunion plants or departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.184" offset="836106">The committees in addition to handling grievances in discussing with management, problems concerning plant production efficiency, have dealt with a wide variety of other matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.973" offset="879261">Thus, doing a period covered by the complaint, the employee committees have complained about, discussed, made request and recommendations, and otherwise, dealt with Cabot with respect to seniority in the transfer of employee, job classifications, job bidding, improvement of working facility, overtime records and time cards, the merit system, layoff and makeup time, working schedules, vacation and sick leave, the allocation of company houses, holidays, and other matters affecting their employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.335" offset="1040697">And while management did not accede to our request, it did frequently act upon request or complaints made by this committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.588" offset="1077687">First among other things, management agreed to change from a company to a plant seniority system in certain plants to put up vents in tops of warehouses, to furnish workloads at cost, to permit employees to report early and leave early on weekends, and to establish an annual basis for allocating overtime.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.489" offset="1181341">Although there's no provision in the bylaws for Central Committee, Central Committee exist the part of the employee representation plant is composed of the chairmen of each plant committee and meets annually with top management.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.973" offset="1239228">The central committee at its 1955 and 1956 annual meetings with Cabot's Director of Industrial Relations, Mr. Reno Stinson, made proposals and had discussions with respect to matters similar to those handled by the plant committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.563" offset="1305579">These subjects included among other items, a three-week vacation for employees with 10 year's service, annual sick leave and sick or disability benefits, whether shiftmen should be permitted to make up days lost in work, a request for the creation of new job classifications, a proposal for greater uniformity among the different plants and maintaining job classifications, more opportunities for employees to shift from plant to plant, from department to department, and finally, proposals for a general wage increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.332" offset="1448730">With respect to each of the proposals or requests made by -- at these meetings, Director Stinson set forth Cabot's position or policy, discussed whether or not acceding to the proposals or to requests would be economically feasible in the point of view of Cabot and sought to reach some solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.164" offset="1524067">In some instances, Stinson expressed approval of the request or he promised to do -- to see what could be done about remedy in a situation complained of.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.963" offset="1567222">In other instances, Stinson told the committeemen to take it up with local management.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.541" offset="1589582">In still other instances, Stinson expressed disapproval of the request and gave his reasons for doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.191" offset="1636185">On the basis of these and other facts in the record, the Board determined that the committees in question are labor organizations within the meaning of Section 2 (5) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.382" offset="1684877">That section reads as follows and I quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.348" offset="1696789">“The term 'labor organization' means any organization of any kind, or any agency or employee representation committee or plant, in which employees participate and which exists for the purpose, in whole or in part, of dealing with employers concerning grievances, labor disputes, wages, rates of pay, hours of employment, or conditions of work.”</text>
            <text syncTime="423.302" offset="1796577">When the activities of the committees, as I have described them, are put down beside, playing an explicit wording of Section 2 (5), the conclusion seems quite clear that the committee exactly the statutory definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.668" offset="1858017">Thus, employees participate in these committees through their elective representatives and the committee that exists at least in part for their purpose of dealing with Cabot and employer concerning grievances and working conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.592" offset="1917785">Why then did the court below find the committees not to be labor organizations?</text>
            <text syncTime="459.906" offset="1942967">The answer lies in the Court's erroneous belief that the term dealing as used in Section 2 (5) is coextensive with bargaining or negotiating as those terms are commonly understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.645" offset="1997928">Otherwise stated, the Court held that a group of employees is not a labor organization unless it exists for the purpose of bargaining or negotiating with employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.366" offset="2044844">The Court went on to find that the committees in this case exist for the purpose of discussing rather than bargaining with Cabot.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.428" offset="2077132">And therefore, the Court concluded that they are not labor organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.646" offset="2097925">In some, the Court below would limit the term “labor organization” as defined in Section 2 (5) to organizations which bargained collectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.307" offset="2148603">But such was not the intention of the Congress which originally wrote the definition of labor organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.124" offset="2175875">Section 2 (5), the present Act, was carried over without change from the original or the Wagner Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.326" offset="2208684">The legislative history of the Wagner Act is more fully detailed in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.931" offset="2227075">Demonstrate that Congress intended the term “labor organization” to be given the widest connotation and to reach specifically the very type of labor organization involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.854" offset="2282768">But Senator Wagner's first bill introduced in 1934 did not include by name, employee representation committee, and his definition of labor organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.244" offset="2328325">During the hearings on the bill, Edwin E. Witte, Professor of Economics at the University of Wisconsin, questioned whether the definition as been written “covers a situation that is most prevalent in this whole field of company unionism.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.139" offset="2395930">That loose organization, if you can call it an organization, but has no members, no dues, that is merely a method of electing representatives known as the employee representation committee, which is the most prevalent form of company union.”</text>
            <text syncTime="591.329" offset="2468655">At Senator Wagner's prompting, Professor Witte proposed that the definition be revised to include by name the employee representation committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.561" offset="2509615">This was done in the final version of the 1934 bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.352" offset="2528737">The following year, Senator Wagner introduced this second bill which had amended became the Wagner Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.300" offset="2556531">It defined “labor organization” as “any organization of any kind or any agency or employee representation committee or plant in which employees participate and which exists for the purpose in whole or in part of dealing with employers concerning grievances, labor disputes, wages, rates of pay, or hours of employment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="639.961" offset="2663215">Ms. Frances Perkins, the then Secretary of Labor, proposed that the latter definition be amended by substituting for the word “dealing” the words “bargaining collectively” and by adding to the end of the definition, the words or conditions of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.348" offset="2736776">But Congress, although it added the words or conditions of work to the end of the definition, refused to change “dealing” to “bargaining collectively.”</text>
            <text syncTime="670.499" offset="2785364">The proposed definition as amended became Section 2 (5) of the Wagner Act, that Congress do not intend to limit the term “labor organization” to organizations which “bargaining collectively” as distinguished for merely “dealing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="688.853" offset="2858820">It's further demonstrated by the memoranda which prepared at the time for the use of the Senate Labor Committee in which are detailed in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.982" offset="2907303">In one of these memoranda, the Senate Committee was advised as follows and I quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.323" offset="2928619">“It has been argued that an employee representation plan or committee arrangement is not the labor organization or a union but simply a method of contact between employers and employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.801" offset="2982536">But the Act is entitled to prescribe its own definitions of labor organizations, for its own purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.234" offset="3012315">And it is clear that unless these plans are included in the definition, whether they merely 'deal' or 'adjust,' or exist for the purpose of collective bargaining, most of the activity of employers in connection therewith which we are seeking to outlaw would fall outside the scope of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.386" offset="3096952">The Act would thus be entirely nullified.”</text>
            <text syncTime="753.398" offset="3117014">It is evident from the forgoing I submit that the Congress which originally defined the term “labor organization” would not agree with the lower court's narrow interpretation of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.946" offset="3191202">The same is to be said of the Congress which in 1947 reenacted without change the broad definition of labor organization contained in Section 2 (5) of the Wagner Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.885" offset="3238954">In doing so, Congress specifically disclaimed any intention to change the definition of labor organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.716" offset="3270196">Nonetheless, the court below held the exact opposite on the basis of a somewhat unusual approach to legislative history to its claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.628" offset="3313873">The Hartley or House bill contained a provision which would have permitted an employer to establish or maintain a committee of employee and discuss what matters of mutual interest, including grievances and working conditions, provided that the employees could not have a bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.909" offset="3399032">If this proposal had been adopted by Congress, the effect would have been to exempt such committees from the reach of the statutory prohibition against employer domination or support of labor organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.015" offset="3459427">But Congress rejected the proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.131" offset="3475937">In doing so, the conference committee stated and I quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.046" offset="3495581">“This provision is omitted from the conference agreement since the Act by its terms permits individual employees and groups of employees to meet with the employer and Section 9 (a) of the conference agreement permits employers to answer their grievances.”</text>
            <text syncTime="867.278" offset="3572485">The court below read the statement coupled with Section 9 (a) of the Act as amended to mean that Congress adopted rather than rejected as it did to propose any question.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.864" offset="3622849">This reading of the statute and legislative history is untenable.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.487" offset="3641344">The conference committee simply state -- made it clear that there was no need for such a proposal because the statute otherwise adequately safeguard the right of the individual employee and of groups of employees to meet with their employer and discuss matters of mutual interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.772" offset="3718457">Section 9 (a) is the majority rule provision of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.093" offset="3735698">Its basic clause provides that the representatives designated by a majority of employee in a corporate unit “shall be the exclusive representatives in respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment, or other conditions of employment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="928.582" offset="3817723">This clause was qualified in the Wagner Act by a proviso which stated, “provided that any individual employee or a group of employee shall have the right at any time to present grievances to their employer.”</text>
            <text syncTime="946.146" offset="3887940">The Taft-Hartley Act added the following to both proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.576" offset="3913644">“And to have such grievances adjusted, without the intervention of the bargaining representative, as long as the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of a collective bargaining contract or agreement being in effect then in effect provided further that the bargain representative has been given opportunity to be present at such adjustment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="978.106" offset="4015835">The provisos thus deal with the right of individual employee and groups of employee where an exclusive bargaining representative has been selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.250" offset="4060348">And they give assurance that any individual employee or groups of employees continues to have the right to present grievances to their employer and to have them adjusted independently of the bargaining representative, subject to the latter's right to be present at the adjustment in order to protect the bargaining contract or the interest of the entire unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.933" offset="4151150">The provisos do not deal with the question whether employee representation committees are labor organizations within the meaning of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.929" offset="4191065">And there is no basis certainly for inspiring that the provisos intended to permit employers to dominate or to support employee committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.615" offset="4237876">Indeed as previously noted, Congress made clear that there was no purpose to remove from the definition of labor organization, employee representation committees to the type involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.609" offset="4289808">And thereby to sanction, there's domination and support by employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.972" offset="4315303">In view of the positive disclaimer of any legislative intent to change the definition of labor organization, there is certainly no warrant for presuming as the Court did below that Congress effected such a change by indirections.</text>

            <text syncTime="1755.980" offset="7127333">I may say that the -- we have not urged our interpretation of the Wagner Act because we felt that the purpose of the 1947 amendments was so clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.802" offset="7174562">But, if Your Honor will refer to the hearing -- the 1934 hearings on Senate bill 29, 26, which is contained in the first volume of the legislative history of the 1935 Act at pages 39 and 40, you will find that Senator Wagner, the proponent of the Act stated, "It is equally important to note that the bill does not prevent employers from setting up societies or organizations to deal with problems of group welfare, health, charity, recreation, insurance or benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.770" offset="7326490">All of these functions can and should be fulfilled by employer-employee organizations."</text>

            <text syncTime="1823.690" offset="7398170">So, Senator Wagner was there putting the same emphasis that we put here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2450.717" offset="9906239">That was explained in House Report Number 245, which is also found on page 15 of our brief as follows, “During World War II, many employers with the help of the Government set up labor management committees with which they discussed matters of mutual interest.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2645.701" offset="10686151">It was necessary to read the bill, in other words, in the light of the conference report and the statement of managers on the part of the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.790" offset="10718542">When the bill is read in that fashion, it is seen that what the conference report does is to incorporate the benediction, if you will, of the former 8 (d) (3) in the Hartley bill into the conference bill by indirection, it's true, but nevertheless, it was done and that was a legislative intent, and if that was a legislative intent, that must be the meaning of the statute.</text>
