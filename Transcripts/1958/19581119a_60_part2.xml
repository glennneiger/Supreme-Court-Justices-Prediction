            <label>Mr. William Hitz</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">I like however to attempt to (Inaudible) of actual picture before I leave this point and to illustrate by the record, the conclusion that we draw, namely, that the final remarks of the -- of the Chairman, Senator Watkins that there would be 10 days within which we say there can be further or another attempt to comply, another opportunity to comply but that was indeed a second order after a completed contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.892" offset="250964">I would like, leave of court, to please invite its attention to page 48 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.398" offset="292968">Now, after the demand that we say was a final demand and completed this picture, on page 47, Mr. Flaxer again endeavors to reopen the matter advancing again his Taft -- supposed Taft-Hartley argument of incapability of performing the compliance with the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.320" offset="376665">And at the bottom of page 48, Mr. Flaxer concludes this effort by saying, “Sir, I don't think the issue has ever come up before.”</text>
            <text syncTime="78.818" offset="418670">Mr. -- Senator Watkins then indicating again the finality of the position that he takes with respect to the failure to comply in answer to the subpoena states, “Maybe it has not but I do not think any court would ever resolve itself against the United States finding out what organization its members belong to.”</text>
            <text syncTime="100.420" offset="505083">There, he finally puts to rest this affirmative defense that Mr. Flaxer has brought into the hearing room.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.878" offset="534862">And from then on, there is the second effort to obtain the documents in answer to the deep-rooted legislative purpose here and Mr. Arens then gets down to the immediate subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.709" offset="594213">“What can we do next to seek compliance?</text>
            <text syncTime="126.000" offset="607378">How long would it take you, Mr. Flaxer?”</text>
            <text syncTime="127.902" offset="615006">And so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.656" offset="618036">“Could it be done in a week?”</text>
            <text syncTime="129.717" offset="622216">It could be -- imagine it could be done in a week and he is given 10 days or at least, the interrogator, Mr. Arens says -- suggests 10 days and Senator Watkins then said, “Since you have made the reply that it could be done in a week, that will be the order -- that will be the order of the committee.”</text>
            <text syncTime="150.098" offset="703718">Now, he doesn't say, “We are releasing you from the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.017" offset="731408">That will be the order of the committee, that you submit that information as requested by counsel not as extended from the subpoena for the committee within 10 days from this date.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.160" offset="783966">The record will show that you, of course, have been given that notice not an extension, not notice and that requirement has been made and the order has been made.</text>

            <label>Mr. William Hitz</label>

            <text syncTime="400.195" offset="1704103">I think not only that but it indicates that he would certainly not necessarily comply within 10 days and might well not comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.609" offset="1737853">And indeed, he didn't comply and he wrote a letter and he said, it is in the record here some place I think in the government brief, that “I'm not going to comply and for the same reasons that I didn't bring the records to your hearing”.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.375" offset="1796890">Now, if the order to produce within 10 days, issued orally by Senator Watkins, was an extension of time and if it obliterated the effect of the failure and refusal to produce under the subpoena on the day of hearing, that oral order to produce in the next 10 days, then would have been and must necessarily be considered a change and a modification of the subpoena and it must be then with the power of the Senator Watkins to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.694" offset="1990196">We don't think.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.628" offset="1993853">We think that he had the power to issue the oral order.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.779" offset="2006497">We do not think he had the power to change the subpoena duces tecum's terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.290" offset="2028544">And again, I repeat that the doctrine of fundamental fairness which gave birth to the Quinn and the Watkins cases does not pertain to the facts in this case and does not in any way influenced Mr. Flaxer as he was on that stand incapable of producing and complying.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>

          <turn speaker="david_rein" startTime="944.433" stopTime="1122.104">
            <label>Mr. David Rein</label>
            <text syncTime="944.433" offset="3881148">I'll make just two brief comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.691" offset="3890134">First, to address myself to the question raised by Justice Whittaker during the argument about whether or not this statement of -- of Mr. Flaxer be -- could be considered as a nature of a motion to quash the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.526" offset="3949484">I like to bring the Court's attention to page 42 of the record, the last paragraph of Mr. Flaxer's statement which he used this language, and I think it throws light on that question, “I am confident that the members of this committee, after considering my views and after the study of the full implications of the request made in the subpoena, will realize its conflict with the basic union tradition of this country now incorporated to federal law and withdraw the demand for membership list.”</text>
            <text syncTime="990.438" offset="4065155">So, I think in effect what he was doing was asking the Committee to withdraw his opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.115" offset="4083858">One other point I want to address myself to very briefly and that was the point raised from the brief of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.696" offset="4106115">I don't think Mr. Hitz got to accept by reference to the Brian case, and that is the Government takes the position that the petitioner here cannot avail himself of any of the events -- of any of the events that occurred at the hearing because says the Government “Even if he had them properly directed by a quorum to answer and as appropriately had the pertinency of the questions explained by a quorum, he would, nevertheless, have refused to answer.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.518" offset="4217396">We understand the doctrine of Watkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.948" offset="4227114">This Court does not speculate as to what a witness would have done if the requirements which were imposed upon the Committee by the Watkins case are not met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.845" offset="4266715">And that as long as those things are not met, it's unnecessarily to consider as to what the witness would have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.032" offset="4295450">As a matter of fact, the Court did not do that in Watkins, and it did not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.175" offset="4312064">And I like to bring to the Court's attention the fact that in Watkins, the witness even more strongly than here indicated that he was going to refuse to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.819" offset="4350621">I do not -- I'm reading now from the opinion of this Court in Watkins on 185.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.307" offset="4372564">There, Watkins said, “I do not believe that such questions are relevant to the work of this committee nor do I believe that this committee has the right to undertake the public exposure of persons because of their past activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.624" offset="4417912">I may be wrong that the committee may have this power, but until and unless a court of law so holds and directs me to answer, I most firmly refuse to discuss the political activities of my past associates.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.417" offset="4465037">I think that this is clearly in conflict with the argument of the Government here that the true basis, the Government puts in its brief, the true basis of petitioner's refusal to answer was his objections that it was -- the subpoena was in violation of the Fourth Amendment and was not on the ground of the events that occurred at the hearing as I say that that is no reason or whether that can be raised with the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.939" offset="4559078">Thank you.</text>
