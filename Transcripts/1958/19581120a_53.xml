            <label>Mr. Reeves Bowen</label>
            <text syncTime="8.058" offset="135607">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.304" offset="144593">The question before this Court in this case is as to whether Section 942.02 Florida Statutes unconstitutionally interferes with the right of ingress and egress of a witness who is subjected to its terms in violation of Article IV, of the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, Section 2 and the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.473" offset="273220">This section is an integral part of a Uniform Act which is called Uniform Act to Secure the Attendance of Witnesses Within or Without a State in Criminal Proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.734" offset="338317">The section which I was -- the Supreme Court of Florida held to be unconstitutional provides that when a criminal case is pending in a court of record of a State which has an active reciprocal legislation and the judge of that State makes a certificate when it -- a criminal case is pending or a grand jury investigation is either underway or is about to begin.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.349" offset="460779">The judge makes a certificate to that effect and says in that certificate how many days the witness will be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.531" offset="481468">They send that certificate down to the State where the witness is, which also has the same law.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.663" offset="534026">And there, a judge of a court of record procures the attendance of the witness before it and he has two options as interpreted by the Supreme Court of Florida and it's a fair interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.425" offset="597034">The judge, if there is a recommendation in the certificate that the witness be taken into custody and bodily delivered to an officer of the demanding State, the judge of the court there may, if he finds that's a desirable thing to do order such custody and delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.759" offset="686373">But even though the judge does not find in favor of that he may also -- he may issue a subpoena -- I mean a summons directed to the witness commanding him to go to the requesting State and there shall appear as a witness during the time specified in the certificate.</text>

            <text syncTime="187.303" offset="852616">Mr. O'Neill was a resident of the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.335" offset="868707">His presence was desired in -- before a New York grand jury which was investigating the disposition of funds of certain union to one of which was the Distillery Rectifying Wine and Allied Workers International Union of America, and Mr. O'Neill, who was the president of that union, he's the chairman of the executive board and he is also the chairman of the welfare fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.500" offset="1001409">And his testimony -- and the -- and the investigation was -- was aimed at ascertaining whether there had been embezzlement or a conspiracy to embezzle the funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.910" offset="1055013">His testimony was deemed to be material and necessary and altogether at the question of misappropriation of funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.490" offset="1097331">Mr. Francis H. Clark, Assistant District Attorney, made an affidavit in which he outlined all of these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.577" offset="1129723">He set up in that affidavit that efforts had been made without avail to procure Mr. O'Neill to come before that grand jury, to appear to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.148" offset="1176012">It said that he had consistently refused to testify, that he had -- had rejected all of the pleas that have been made to get him to come voluntarily and there was no way to get him there voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.066" offset="1235675">It was -- it was specified that they needed him for 15 days.</text>

            <text syncTime="627.946" offset="2615150">This Court said in Paul against Virginia that the sole purpose of the Act was to say to the States that whatever privileges you grant your own or establish for your own citizens, those you should allow the citizens of other States no more, no less.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.191" offset="2688188">And in Maxwell against Bugbee, this Court said the purpose of that provision was to prevent discrimination were allowed -- there's no discrimination manifestly because the law applies to residents of Florida as well as to citizens of other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.985" offset="2755271">But, I desperately say that I -- I have no doubt of the proposition that the Fourteenth Amendment which protects the rights of national citizenship, it protects the right of free ingress and egress and I believe that if there were no constitutional provision on privileges and immunities at all, that it would be inherent in national citizenship that the right of ingress and egress would be inherent in that citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.170" offset="2880031">So we -- we start off with a proposition that -- that a citizen does have the right of ingress and egress, but that is not an absolute right.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.682" offset="2930082">Now, this Court said in Tumor against Witzel that -- that the -- the Privileges and Immunities Clause was not like many other constitutional provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1548.097" offset="6295803">Respondent's brief takes to position that there's no power in any State to legislate on extradition save as that power is conferred by the United States Constitution and statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.542" offset="6369573">Well, that isn't what this Court said in Innes against Tobin.</text>

            <text syncTime="1579.565" offset="6421608">And according to the wording of the -- of the federal statute which I might point out is more limited in its scope than the constitutional provision would have authorized Congress to enact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.516" offset="6473435">The federal statute authorized extradition only from the State to which she had fled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.364" offset="6504782">And she had not fled to Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.889" offset="6514918">Therefore, she could not be extradited under federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.077" offset="6531636">But in that case, Texas had a state statute which was invoked and she was ordered extradited under the state statutes which -- which was wholly undetermined and not authorized by the federal statute or Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.094" offset="6603734">And this Court affirmed that upon the proposition that the Congress, by not including a provision for extradition of that sort, had left the field open to the same place or they left the -- the authority in the same place where this was then before the words in the Constitution, that is, in the States themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.839" offset="6710732">And that -- that decision was not based on anything at all except -- I mean it just -- it did one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.360" offset="6752841">It upheld a state statute which was an independent enactment not dependent upon the federal law for its validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.776" offset="6790457">Now, in Kentucky against Dennison which I don't claim to be in point, but which I think has a good analogy, this Court recognized that even without the extradition provision in Article IV, Section 2 that the States would have had the right in their own self-interest and as an act of comity to furnish each other of -- of persons accused of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.036" offset="6939564">In other words, make him available to the fugitive from justice for example without benefit of any constitutional provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.072" offset="6975613">The Court said that rather than -- than take the position assumed by the Government of -- of Ohio, on a certain point, it would have been better to have left that clause entirely out of the Constitution and left it up for the State to -- to have and no one else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.792" offset="7038516">Well now, if the States -- and I think that case is clearly authority for that -- would have had the -- the power to enact legislation for the surrender of fugitive one to the other without any federal constitutional provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.852" offset="7106748">If they're to have that power, why then do they not have the correlative power to legislate so as to pass witnesses back and forth because without witnesses, there can be no defense against crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.195" offset="7168188">You cannot curb or -- or punish crime unless you got the witnesses to do it with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.736" offset="7202356">Now, to get a -- a hold to these venues of that -- that you mentioned, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, about the uniform state of extradition law, I believe that comes from the doctrine of Innes against Tobin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.245" offset="7276335">That where the Federal Congress when in the first place, the -- the United States Constitution deals only with fugitives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.072" offset="7311653">It does not say anything about it but -- and the statute likewise to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.177" offset="7332028">But take the Innes case and the -- and the Kentucky against Dennison cases together and they seem to mean that since it is not covered by federal law in any way, and since the States have the inherent power to do it while the federal law has not preempted the field, while then the -- they would have the right to pass that uniform state of extradition law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2611.272" offset="10548433">Let me give you one more attack on this question of necessity for -- for -- getting the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.817" offset="10602663">Most -- every one of the States have the confrontation which requires discretion of presence of the witness so that the defendant could confront.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.554" offset="10645608">In -- in most of the States I understand that that's backed up by a constitutional guarantee, by the State's constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.634" offset="10677896">Well, if -- and you can't use a deposition against that no matter if you've got the one witness that saw the determinate -- shoot the -- the -- murdered person down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.332" offset="10728678">And the only one that you can tie him to the crime at all maybe -- and that witness is in Alabama and we want him in Florida, we can't use the deposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.836" offset="10778728">We -- we got to get the witness into Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.812" offset="10790640">And that's the way it is in most, all of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.414" offset="10805060">Now, you might say of course, that that rule doesn't necessarily apply to a grand jury investigation, but it's my information that many of the States don't permit -- the law doesn't permit the use of deposition for venues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.564" offset="10873605">We never heard of it in Florida, never heard of a deposition for a grand jury against the defendants at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.008" offset="10899414">It has bee been in our, I don't -- I'm not aware.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.084" offset="10907669">Now, the defendant himself can take deposition to be used at his trial but the State can't do this just to put the witness before him to confront him and so he can be cross-examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.744" offset="10954376">And there -- there is still another thought on that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.971" offset="10979244">If you could use deposition in all similar proceedings against a defendant, they are noted for not being of anything like equal value to the life, flesh and blood of the witness who comes up before that jury, they can see him and hear the sound of his voice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.197" offset="11072136">They can evaluate him and -- and could work on his testimony, yet utterly impossible in a deposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.542" offset="11117589">So -- so you take two educated people, one inherent liar and the other a person, a truthful man and you let them make a deposition and one of them lied about the truth, while another tells the truth, this usually -- they'll -- in the -- in the deposition and will disclose which one is the truthful man and which one is not.</text>

            <text syncTime="2944.182" offset="11880051">This, I consider a very important case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.859" offset="11898859">In fact, I suspect it is a case important to the practicing lawyer, much more so, than many of the cases which reached this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.447" offset="11961135">I want to call your attention at the outset to the fact that there are two aspects to the Act which is under consideration here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.021" offset="11999483">First, is that aspect which provides that the judge in the demanding State may in his certificate recommend that the desired witness be taken into immediate custody and be delivered to officers of the demanding State to be returned to the demanding State, as a witness before a court or grand jury in that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.064" offset="12123617">The second aspect is, that which provides for the issuance of a witness subpoena in Florida, let us say, directing the witness to appear as a witness and testify before a court or grand jury while he's halfway in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.425" offset="12201044">Now, these two aspects of the Act were both passed on by the Supreme Court of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.135" offset="12235943">In some respects, the questions which I think control the decision of the Supreme Court, on the first aspect of the case, likewise of necessity would control the decision of the Supreme Court of Florida on the second aspect of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.048" offset="12315564">I should like to discuss both aspects briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.085" offset="12339702">In the first place, we are in this country, a union of states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.463" offset="12377213">The Federal Government has certain powers and a field in which it operates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.962" offset="12403231">I want to talk to you now about the constitutional power and authority of the States to adopt a law providing that a person, a citizen, who is not charged or suspected with having committed any crime in any State, may be seized unceremoniously and hauled off as a prisoner to a distant State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.338" offset="12524753">Does that constitutional power exist?</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.185" offset="12540113">I respectfully suggest to you that it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.407" offset="12557040">In the first place, in the brief which I filed on behalf of the respondent, I have reviewed at great length, perhaps greater length than the circumstances might justify, the decisions on this subject of interstate rendition of fugitives from justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.766" offset="12638438">And I am of the opinion, and it was my conclusion that this authority from every corner, from every court have always held that the power of one State to surrender to a sister State even a fugitive from justice, is derived from and rest solely upon Section 2, Article IV of the Constitution of the United States and the federal-enabling statutes which were passed to implement that constitutional provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.829" offset="12814712">And it is my argument, it is my contention, that if he required that constitutional provision and those federal implementing statutes to authorize one State to surrender to a sister State a fugitive from justice, then surely a like authority must be required and must be necessary to authorize the seizure and arrest of a citizen not charged with any crime in any State and his transportation against his will in chains perhaps but certainly as a prisoner to a distant State, merely as a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.506" offset="12989419">Now, Mr. -- the Attorney General, my esteemed friends on the other side has argued to you all about the difficulties of securing witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.443" offset="13033096">I'm aware of those difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.848" offset="13042813">But I say his argument proves that you must.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.837" offset="13062771">I suggest to you that no such power exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.020" offset="13079489">That is the power to seize and surrender a citizen charged with no offense to a sister State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.823" offset="13106657">And if that could bring -- his argument were correct, I think there's a much more direct way to go at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.484" offset="13137272">There's a much more direct way to reach the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.019" offset="13155453">If it can be so, if my friend's argument is valid, if the police for example, authority, then I'd say the very power that he invoked should be sufficient to authorize the State of Florida to dispatch enacting that the courts of this State shall have complete authority to issue a witness subpoena, to turn him in, in the courts of any State in this country which has enacted their law in such cases providing for the issuance of witness subpoena returnable in the courts of any other States.</text>

            <text syncTime="3329.542" offset="13421589">That within the boundaries of the State of Florida, in the enforcement of the laws of Florida, and in securing the attendance of witnesses in the courts of the State of Florida, it may be that the Legislature of Florida would have authority to pass for authorizing the attachment of a witness, authorizing a requirement that he give bond for a period in that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.331" offset="13528691">But, I suggest to you that that is no different than the question we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.936" offset="13547081">And while I'm on the subject, today it was required of me that I refer to three cases which are in the brief: One is McLean against Mississippi in 95 F.2d, in which the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in its very clear language held, that when the limits of a State are reached, the official character of its officers drop from their shoulders like a cloak.</text>

            <text syncTime="3607.701" offset="14534196">My only reply to you is this, that when the original Articles of Confederation were adopted, before the States became a State, before their fate became a federal union, this same provision in substance and almost word for word was in the Articles of Confederation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.914" offset="14619042">And, according to the historic reasoning and the decisions that I've read it is indicated that the men who were in charge of the governmental affairs of the confederation realized that without a compact of that sort in the Articles of Confederation that there would be disposition on the part of some part that was not to surrender, disposition of another's to surrender and that this was necessary in order to make sure that these things were done and to promote the administration of justice and grant them in the courts between the several counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.587" offset="14785703">And this was carried forth into the Constitution of the United States in Section 2 of Article IV and hence, the authorities indicate to mean that this is the historical background for the proposition that the authority is derived from the Federal Constitution and the laws and acts to be implemented.</text>

            <text syncTime="3715.299" offset="14964590">And may I suggest to Your Honor that one of the consequences of a more perfect union (Inaudible) by the Constitution of the United States, in my judgment was, to remove from the States any power to surrender citizens from one State to another, except in the instances provided in the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.779" offset="15054451">Now then, I diverted there just a moment but the first point I want to make before I leave was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.111" offset="15087783">That this power to surrender fugitives from justice is a power which is, I believe, created and exists by virtue of Section 2 Article IV of the Constitution of the United States and without it, there'd be no such thing, any similar authority is necessary if citizens are not charged with any crime and that fugitives from justice are to be surrendered by one State to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.044" offset="15199587">Now, the next proposition I should like to discuss briefly is, that the Fourteenth Amendment for this, States to pass any law which abridges the rights of the citizens of the several States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3789.854" offset="15262804">Now, all general statements are dangerous of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="3794.431" offset="15281089">This is one of those statements which is likewise a dangerous statement, I realized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3800.105" offset="15303764">However, one of the rights of national citizenship is the right to pass freely from State to State to pass to -- both are interstate, to stay there as long as you want to, go to another place in the same State, and to depart there from.</text>
            <text syncTime="3818.745" offset="15378369">And I respectfully suggest that the discussion of this particular proposition by the Supreme Court of Florida is -- these very little to be desired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.168" offset="15420061">Now, I think that Mr. Bowen perhaps has an idea a little different than I do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3837.343" offset="15452766">As I understand that Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, it isn't simply a matter of discrimination, although discrimination exists certainly, discrimination between citizens of different States is permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.396" offset="15516923">But, I -- as I understand it and from my reading of this, it comes down to this, that the rights of citizens cannot be abridged by the law of any State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3869.243" offset="15580348">Now, I started the proposition in my contentions that the States have no power to pass such a law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3876.069" offset="15607620">I was interested in one of the questions that was asked by one of Your Honors, about what would happen if they're going through a State that didn't have this law?</text>
            <text syncTime="3885.423" offset="15645027">Now, let me talk about that for just a minute because I think it illustrates the proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3890.268" offset="15664462">Georgia doesn't have this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3894.307" offset="15680554">But let us suppose that Alabama did have the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3897.134" offset="15691943">I don't know, maybe it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3898.318" offset="15696645">I think it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3900.297" offset="15704586">And suppose we started back with the prisoner in a car going to New York and they had him in handcuffs because they knew very well that if they ever turn him loose he would be -- disappears in a hurry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3914.828" offset="15762683">So they get on to Georgia and the man decide if he's going to walk away from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3921.624" offset="15789850">They let him -- they take off his handcuffs and maybe he says, "Goodbye, gentlemen, I'm going."</text>
            <text syncTime="3927.780" offset="15814510">Now, they have no valid process with the State of Florida because that is halfway the state line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3936.174" offset="15848051">There isn't any process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3938.425" offset="15857037">They're not officers of the State of New York because under the rule in McLean against Mississippi, (Inaudible) and these other cases, as soon as they step out, have gone to the State of New York, they no longer are officers of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3950.810" offset="15906565">They no longer have the authority of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3953.974" offset="15919313">That has evaporated when they left the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3957.444" offset="15933106">So they are only private citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3960.395" offset="15944913">So we have a situation in which private citizens are undertaking to restrain a person having liberty, having in their possession no valid process of any kind.</text>

            <text syncTime="4765.307" offset="19164557">Suppose a court sitting in Florida had a case before it in which the disposition of property in California is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4774.288" offset="19200502">The court in Florida may say to the defendant, “We enjoin and restrain you for making any conveyances of properties in California.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4784.483" offset="19241253">And the defendant may say, “If Your Honor please, I deny your jurisdiction to make such an order.</text>

            <text syncTime="4793.023" offset="19275421">And therefore, and if he does so, and the court says, “My friends, we had you before the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="4800.555" offset="19305618">You are subject to our orders and you will be found in contempt."</text>
            <text syncTime="4805.349" offset="19324740">Now, this very subject that Your Honor has alluded to, I suggest to you, is not entirely free from difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4812.407" offset="19352952">I don't believe that the courts are unanimous in expressing the view that I have just expressed to you.</text>

            <text syncTime="4823.157" offset="19396002">But it's based on the fact that the respondent, the defendant is present in the Court which proposes to impose the sanction and it has the authority then to require your views of things and he is there to enforce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4836.575" offset="19449710">The same thing comes up frequently in Florida when the courts down there say to a man, “We enjoin you from prosecuting your suit for divorce against your wife any further up in New York, for example or in some other States.”</text>

            <text syncTime="4977.677" offset="20014059">The Marshal, or whoever he is, in the District of Columbia sent the sheriff by the name of Chase (ph) down in Dade County a warrant and said pick up so and so, pick up (Inaudible).</text>

            <text syncTime="4990.455" offset="20065155">And so they picked up (Inaudible) down in Florida and passed it and filed a habeas corpus and contended that they had no authority to seize him whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="4999.952" offset="20103189">The Supreme Court of Florida in discharging a writ of habeas corpus says that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="5005.831" offset="20126699">If the warrant from the District of Columbia had been there, it wouldn't have been effective in Florida because it has no extraterritorial effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5015.710" offset="20166196">And unless it is under the extradition statutes, it would have no legal validity and no legal standing.</text>

            <text syncTime="6415.482" offset="25765282">I said I don't think this case is moot because if this Court -- Court of the State of Florida has swung in the balance the question of whether it can collect that bond or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="6450.018" offset="25903417">But if the Court should dismiss the case as being moot, then Florida is automatically cutoff from collecting that bond because it would leave in effect the order of the Circuit Court and affirmed by the Supreme Court saying they have no right to -- to do anything to him at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="6469.129" offset="25979904">We'd -- we'd lose the right to collect the bond we are entitled have.</text>

            <text syncTime="6545.897" offset="26287000">Then if the judge finds that to be true, he will necessarily find that he's not a necessary witness and he won't -- he -- he can't under the law, hold him to set up.</text>
