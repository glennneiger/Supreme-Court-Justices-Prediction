            <text syncTime="53.285" offset="316479">After all that discussion, I think it might be relaxing to take a little secret now.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.536" offset="333511">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.066" offset="343646">There were two questions posed by these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.462" offset="353259">The first is whether or not the shipowner is responsible for an unsafe condition which is created by an independent contractor in the course of unloading operations, and the second is whether the Court of Appeals may reverse a fact finding of the trial judge sitting in admiralty under circumstances where the fact finding -- where the finding of the trial judge is not shown to be clearly erroneous under the McAllister decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.897" offset="470915">Briefly, the circumstances in this case show that Mr. Crumady was a longshoreman, one of a group of longshoremen who were engaged to discharge a cargo of lumber from this vessel, the Joachim Hendrik Fisser, I'll call it the Fisser for purposes of convenience, in January of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.282" offset="552521">He was employed by the impleaded respondent, the Nacirema Operating Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.972" offset="583241">They went to work on the morning of January 4th -- 2nd, 1954 and discharged most of the cargo which had been piled above the level of the coaming here in this hole.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.397" offset="640920">Perhaps I should first state to the Court that all of the gear that Your Honors see on this model was designed for -- a three-ton gear, designed with a workload capacity of three tons.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.655" offset="694000">That is the maximum safe workload capacity of three tons.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.623" offset="709883">That included these booms and this gear.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.762" offset="726392">And I would like to take a moment or two to describe the various parts of the gear here.</text>

            <text syncTime="240.860" offset="1066820">I wanted to say first, if this is the so-called up and down boom, this boom is used as Your Honors can see it, it manipulates these cables by means of winches that are located at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.549" offset="1113527">They're not visible on this model, but they're located right here.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.438" offset="1129096">So that the pulleys and the cables on this side lift it up, and after this boom lifted up, then this boom is used to pull these cables over toward the shore on the pier where the cargo has landed about where I am standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.111" offset="1187819">Now, when -- as I said before, this is the runner and these two slates or cables which Your Honors see here, this is called a guy.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.833" offset="1230660">A guy is just another name for another -- a number of ropes.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.890" offset="1242885">And -- and this is the so-called preventer.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.886" offset="1254902">Preventer is just another name for the rope.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.247" offset="1264410">These are used for the purpose of securing the respected booms here, while these booms are taking the strain on the cargo on the load which is being lifted.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.856" offset="1306833">And now, the testimony shows that when this operation first started, this boom here was rigged by the crew so that the head of the boom was directly over the center of the hatch right here.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.255" offset="1368377">Now, as the discharging progressed, the longshoreman moved this head of the boom over more towards the port side so that the head of the boom was located according to the findings and the factual picture which I am trying to present is taken right from the fact findings of Judge Wortendyke who was the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.612" offset="1469837">He found that the head of the port boom was about two thirds, about one-third of the way for the center of the hatch to the port and it was secured by this so-called preventer to the -- to the side of the vessel just about a switch, about pretty close to where it is here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2952.342" offset="11912756">Evidently, the purpose was to getting more lateral poles so that they could remove timbers that were underneath this part of the deck port ward in the wings of the vessel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2986.047" offset="12047548">And before they did that, they lifted the timbers up with a crowbar and inserted the sling around it, and then attached the sling to this hook that is on the runners here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.426" offset="12133125">And then they started to pull and they kept on pulling, and actually what happened is -- I can demonstrate here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3023.922" offset="12199058">In other words, they were trying to pull the ship apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.552" offset="12209612">When they did that, as they did that, something broke, something had to break.</text>

            <text syncTime="3033.701" offset="12238137">This would cause the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.094" offset="12243780">It's not a question of the shifting of the boom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.561" offset="12253602">It's true the Court of Appeals and the District Court both have referred to the shifting of the boom.</text>
