            <label>Mr. Maxwell Keith</label>
            <text syncTime="35.749" offset="246366">This is on a writ of certiorari to the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.083" offset="263711">The District Court below had granted the respondents here and the defendants below motion to dismiss an antitrust complaint and for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.865" offset="314807">The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the entry of a judgment against the plaintiff petitioner here dismissing the complaint and for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.390" offset="364962">The issue is whether or not the antitrust laws has a charter of economic liberty, protect the single trader from conduct prohibited under the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.351" offset="416789">Specifically in this case, it is whether or not the single trader is entitled to be protected from conspiracies designed to suppress and eliminate his competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.370" offset="464854">And whether or not he is entitled to be free of the exercise of monopoly power designed to suppress and eliminate his competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.015" offset="503411">The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has held that Section 4 of the Clayton Act which gives the private party the right to sue for anything forbidden by the antitrust laws is subject to a judicial imposition, a judicial requirement that the private trader in addition to showing personal injury as it is -- as is required by Section 4, also prove or convince -- convince the judiciary that the conduct which violates an act of Congress also has a conceivably injurious impact on the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.380" offset="660877">The petitioner here was a retailer of household appliances, radio, television sets, washers and driers and other miscellaneous household appliances, Stoves and refrigerators.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.374" offset="732871">He was located in the Mission District in San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.796" offset="746559">The Mission District in San Francisco is well known in the appliance and furniture industry as an importance feat for the retailing of these products.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.790" offset="778533">San Francisco of course is a very important area of interstate trade and commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.531" offset="797445">It is the third or fourth largest consumer area in United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.015" offset="819388">The respondent Broadway-Hale is a competitor -- was a competitor of petitioner Klor's Inc.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.942" offset="851153">And it is specifically alleged in the complaint in paragraph 8, that the defendant Hale operates a chain of key stores in the Westcoast area of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.634" offset="909876">It enjoys a monopolistic buying power by reason of the large number of retail outlets it operates.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.991" offset="943313">It has used its monopolistic buying power to negotiate terms and conditions of acquisition and purchase of the products manufactured, distributed and sold by the manufacturer-distributor defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.392" offset="1000991">The other respondents are manufacturers of household appliances.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.248" offset="1020322">They are large, powerful intrastate corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.763" offset="1038399">They are well-known, I'm sure, to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.613" offset="1049788">They are Radio Corporation of America or RCA, General Electric Company, Admiral Corporation, Zenith Radio Corporation, Emerson Radio and Phonograph Corporation, Philco Corporation, Whirlpool Zeiger Corporation, Olympic Radio and Television Inc, Tappan Stove Company, Rheem Manufacturing Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.789" offset="1142575">These are named to the complaint along with their affiliated or wholly owned subsidiary distributors which distribute these household appliances in the San Francisco area.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.300" offset="1180609">Admiral -- Admiral Distributors Inc, Zenith H. R. Basford Company, Radio Corporation of America, Leo J. Meyberg Company, Emerson Jefferson Travis, Philco Government Supply Company, General Electric -- General Electric Distributing Corporation, Olympic -- Olympic Television of Northern California, Tappan, O'keefe &amp; Merritt.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.744" offset="1262320">Now, this complaint alleges that these respondents conspired each with the other to suppress and eliminate the competition of Klor's petitioner in favor of Broadway-Hale.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.506" offset="1317386">It alleges therefore that there was a common unity of purpose to suppress Klor's competition in favor of Hale.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.854" offset="1346748">And specifically in paragraph 6 (g) of the complaint, it is said that they have permitted Hale to enjoy monopolistic position in the sale and distribution of the products.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.760" offset="1394395">So I think it may be fairly said giving the complaint all of the inferences and all of the construction that should be rendered to it that this complaint involved a conspiracy to refuse to sell products to Klor's Inc in order to suppress his competition to a competitor, in other words, to interfere with the competitors market.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.917" offset="1483003">Alleges a conspiracy for a time to discriminate against the petitioner, Klor, in favor of the respondent Broadway-Hale.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.555" offset="1513618">In other words to interfere with the free and open competitive market.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.579" offset="1529710">It alleges that there was a common purpose and a plan here to allow Broadway-Hale a monopolistic position in the sale of the respondents' merchandise.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.917" offset="1563042">And I think she clearly alleges that Broadway-Hale used its monopolistic chain buying power to suppress and eliminate the competition of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.851" offset="1598777">And I think it raises fact showing a specific intent by Broadway-Hale to monopolize the retailing of household appliances in the San Francisco area.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.801" offset="1634617">It has specifically alleged that Broadway-Hale refused to do business as a chain buyer utilizing the entire strength of its many stores with the respondent unless they did not do business with Klor's.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.322" offset="1692609">These allegations are uncontested in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.049" offset="1715597">The respondents filed no answer controverting these allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.844" offset="1734719">They filed rather hybrid affidavits in summary judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.751" offset="1754363">They filed a motion to dismiss.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="414.649" stopTime="422.396">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="414.649" offset="1761991">Is it a question of the sufficiency of the complaint or of the propriety advantage over a judgment?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="maxwell_keith" startTime="422.396" stopTime="871.033">
            <label>Mr. Maxwell Keith</label>
            <text syncTime="422.396" offset="1792920">I think that the judgment is on both grounds Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.377" offset="1812877">The judgment rendered by the District Court was both on the -- based upon the lack of cause of action and was based upon the lack of facts to show issues between the parties under the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.315" offset="1884662">As a matter of fact, this affidavit in summary judgments showed the courts below that there was indeed a group refusal to deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.710" offset="1918203">The affidavit showed two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.554" offset="1925622">Number one, that there were a number of other competitors in the San Francisco area.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.849" offset="1946728">They were merely names set forth on a piece of paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.812" offset="1962611">They showed that there are a lot of these competitors in the San Francisco Bay area.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.715" offset="1978284">And number two, they showed that there were other brand names available to the petitioner here other than the respondents named in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.318" offset="2012662">But they also showed as you go through the record as to each affidavit filed by each respondent that there was no delivery of their merchandise to Klor in the supposedly competitive market.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.105" offset="2067832">There was no explanation advanced, no justification, no reason given why Klor was not receiving this merchandise.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.013" offset="2095417">There were no other forms of discovery used.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.012" offset="2111404">There were no depositions filed, no request for admissions, no interrogatories, no settlement of pretrial issues under Rule 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.593" offset="2145782">In short, all that's we have are these hybrid affidavit in summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.755" offset="2162395">Based upon this record showing this group refusal to deal, this uncontested allegations of monopolistic chain buying power.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.376" offset="2192906">The lower court said, “There was no substantiality either in law or in substance to exercise the Court's jurisdiction to protect the single trader.”</text>
            <text syncTime="534.660" offset="2242017">And this was affirmed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on the ground that there was no showing of public injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.627" offset="2277857">And by this, I take it to mean that the antitrust laws are limited in their purpose and scope to showing conduct which has a direct injurious effect on the public such as price fixing and some other type of conduct upon which there's a direct effect on the consumer or the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.751" offset="2378376">This decision was made after this Court had ruled in the Radovich case that the doctrine of public injury as used by the court below has no application under Section 4 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.288" offset="2440547">This issue was specifically before the Court in the Radovich case, that is Radovich versus National Football League because the Ninth Circuit below had held that there -- that the facts in the complaint showed no conceivable injury to the public, no prejudice to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.250" offset="2504391">The writ involved this question of public injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.936" offset="2515153">And this Court specifically met the problem and stated in the opinion that when Congress passes an act, the violation of that act itself creates a public wrong and that the antitrust laws protect the victims of forbidden conduct as well as the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.153" offset="2584012">The decision below is clearly erroneous for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.909" offset="2603029">Number one, it is an improper interpretation of the scope and the purposes and the objectives of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.336" offset="2632704">Number two, it refused to apply the rule of this Court that group boycotts to or group refusal to deal are illegal per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.563" offset="2665618">And that the mere entry into this agreement is forbidden conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.177" offset="2684113">And third, to refuse to give to an antitrust complaint and an antitrust litigant the most elementary rules of Federal Civil Procedure, construction of a complaint in favor of the private litigant, construction of the complaint to see what maybe offered to prove the allegations in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.430" offset="2757047">Now, as to the first contention of error, the antitrust laws of course protect the public from predatory conduct or from conduct which is designed to gouge them of -- of a dollar.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.227" offset="2804276">But clearly, this is not the only purpose and objective of the Congress in -- in enacting the antirust laws and as interpreted by this Court, we may pickup the Attorney General's National Committee to study the antitrust laws and turn to the very first page of this report and see the heading, “A policy against undo limitations or competitive conditions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="698.236" offset="2896332">And -- and read the statement, “The general objective of the antitrust law does promotion of competition in open markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.275" offset="2932485">This policy is a primary feature of private enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.308" offset="2948577">Most Americans have long recognized that opportunity for market access and fostering of market rivalry are basic tenants of our faith and compettion as a form of economical organization.”</text>
            <text syncTime="726.328" offset="3008658">Someone is -- that the antitrust law has act to prohibit conduct which unduly limits competitive opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.981" offset="3039274">And this is regardless of any effect on the public any direct effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.331" offset="3052648">The public is protected by having every trader that wants to get into the market place compete for that consumer by special -- by using his ingenuity, his ability and his skills in the market place.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.569" offset="3109700">And I think when we're talking in terms of substance, we have to get down to the very core of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.114" offset="3135822">And that very core is that every man in this country has an opportunity to go upon the market, and to obtain profits, and to obtain the right to let his abilities and ingenuities and skills determine whether or not he shall succeed or fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.538" offset="3209488">The proper proposition is set forth, vest by Senator Sherman when he discussed the enactment of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.794" offset="3242506">It is the right of every man to work labor and produce in any lawful vocation, and to transport his production on equal terms and conditions under a like circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.049" offset="3291617">This is industrial liberty and lies at the foundation of the equality of all rights and privileges.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.275" offset="3316485">I submit that when Congress passed the antitrust laws, it enacted this policy as far as the constitutional power over interstate commerce could go.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.177" offset="3360057">That every man should be free of conspiracies in the use of monopoly power when he enters into a free and open market.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.298" offset="3392554">And they submitted that the Ninth Circuit has not faced this issue, has not faced the issue of the right of the single trader to be free of predatory conduct directed at suppressing and eliminating his competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.507" offset="3449396">Secondly, the Court erred because it did not apply the per se rule of group refusal to deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.198" offset="3480116">This course -- this Court has stated many times that a group refusal to deal is in -- is illegal per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.745" offset="3506343">The Court of Appeals do not face this rule even though these affidavits disclosed a uniform refusal to deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.322" offset="3532675">But what is meant by per se illegality?</text>
            <text syncTime="859.300" offset="3540616">It has meant that the very entry into the agreements is illegal per se, is illegal conduct, is forbidden by an act of Congress, cannot be added into without raising a private or a government case.</text>

            <text syncTime="896.048" offset="3687528">I think a fair construction of the complaint, Your Honor, alleges a conspiracy to refuse to deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.212" offset="3708217">It says that each of these respondents conspired each with the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.842" offset="3722742">And then it alleges they have refused to accept the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.714" offset="3734235">They have refused to accept the business other than to sell their product to plaintiff while freely selling their products to Hale.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.449" offset="3761194">Now then, when it talks -- when it goes into the monopoly power of Hale in Section 8 of the complaint, I just read to you from Section 6.</text>

            <text syncTime="931.624" offset="3829844">But clearly, there is allegation here that there was a group refusal to deal, a conspiracy each with the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.737" offset="3854294">And as this Court has held recently in the Northern Pacific Railway case, in the Kiefer-Stewart case, in the Times-Picayune case, this is a legal conduct and it is not sanctioned under the antitrust laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="954.557" offset="3921586">The -- the affidavits were submitted to support a legal proposition that there was no public injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.772" offset="3950425">Now, whereas the contention as I understand it of the respondents is that even though we have engaged in forbidden conduct, we have a legal defense that our conduct does not have a direct impact on the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.082" offset="4003715">It doesn't go whether the question that the public is able to -- not able to buy from Klor because of this conduct, does not able to get the advantages of Klor's competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.159" offset="4044048">And I think when you analyze that, it comes down to the proposition that the only conduct forbidden by the antitrust laws are agreements to fix the price of commodity, that is somehow to gouge the public by fixing a high price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.843" offset="4130774">We -- this Court has held in the -- in the McKesson &amp; Robbins case, exactly what it means by per se illegality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.787" offset="4158568">It says that per se legality means that the agreement itself, the entry into the agreement is illegal regardless of -- specifically regardless of market control and specifically regardless of whether the prices fixed are low or high.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.914" offset="4207052">The Court might recall that the Keifer-Stewart case involved a situation where there was a conspiracy to refuse to deal in order to support price contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.787" offset="4242474">And the -- the agreement there was to prevent the retailers from setting too high a price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.500" offset="4265357">The -- the it's the entry into the agreement and this is because the entry in agreement to fix the price means the entry -- means the power to fix a high or a low price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.726" offset="4306317">So that the issue is not the effect on the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.621" offset="4317811">The issue is, what is the conduct to this condemned by the antitrust laws in view of all the purposes and objectives of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.802" offset="4350621">Now lastly, the Court erred in -- in not applying the elementary rules of federal civil procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.476" offset="4385311">This complaint was entitled to be supported.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.829" offset="4394715">It was a bonafide complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.765" offset="4402448">The affidavits disclos that it was bonafide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.916" offset="4411016">They showed the group refusal to deal prima facie wise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.815" offset="4426585">Instead, I think the one raise the opinion, one fails to see that there is admitted that there is a charge here of conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.982" offset="4451349">But clearly, when the pleader says that each conspiring with the other, you have a conspiracy charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.453" offset="4477158">The Court is inconsistent with itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.232" offset="4484263">It says that, “We are concerned with substance materiality.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.783" offset="4502549">But the allegations in this complaint are concerned with substance of the materiality in the sense.It says that respondent Broadway-Hale is a monopolistic chain buyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.754" offset="4546435">It says -- there was a -- there is a plan put to allow this -- this buyer a monopolistic position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.282" offset="4572453">In other words, the proposition of that is that we can take these serious allegations in a -- in a bonafide antitrust complaint and we can ignore them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.087" offset="4607770">And the summary judgment upon affidavits directed solely to show that the public was able to buy a lot of commodities from a lot of retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.895" offset="4642983">And that there -- there were lot of -- that there were other brands available besides the brands involved in a charge of conspiracy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1151.269" offset="4708498">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.739" offset="4730337">United States is appearing in this case as amicus curiae because the decision below seems to raise questions of large importance in the enforcement of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.924" offset="4783104">Where it not for the broad sweep of the decision below upholding the award of summary judgment for the defendants, this would seem to be a rather simple routine antitrust case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.060" offset="4855620">In answer to your question, Mr. Justice Harlan, as to the basis of the judgment -- judgment below, the District Court as appears from its order on page 134 of the record, stated that count one of the complaint is not a cause of action under the Sherman Antitrust Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.497" offset="4949347">And the Court of Appeals in affirming, as appears from the opinion, page 176, bottom of the -- 178 rather, bottom of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.162" offset="5003995">The complaint did not allege a violation of Section 1 of the antitrust laws because it did not state facts from which injury to the public can be perceived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.960" offset="5043179">So that the crucial document in the case is the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.669" offset="5058017">And as Mr. Keith has pointed out, the complaint here contains the standard general allegations of the conspiracy in restraint of trade with resulted damage to the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.006" offset="5115382">And then it goes on to particularize the allegations of the specific restraints that we used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.969" offset="5151222">And it alleges that at the instigation of the plaintiff's next door competitor, Broadway-Hale, a branch of a chain store operation in the -- in the far west.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.040" offset="5219558">A group of suppliers of household appliances including the more -- the most important manufacturers and distributors, entered into an agreement each with the other, had specifically alleged in the complaint, page 11 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.580" offset="5313703">That each of these suppliers of appliances in competition with each other, each agreed that none of them would do business -- that none of them would sell their products to the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.174" offset="5396041">Now, that allegation is -- is of course what is known in the jargon of the antitrust practitioners as a suppliers group boycott, which in it's very nature restrains, eliminates competition in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.488" offset="5485275">First, it restrains competition among the parties to the agrrement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.437" offset="5509099">They are -- they're no longer competing with one another for the costume -- customers of Klor's and with respect to their products.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.032" offset="5547551">That competition is inherently necessarily eliminated by the combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.750" offset="5570330">The other respect in which competition is inherently necessarily restrained is with -- is a relation to Klor's.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.081" offset="5611708">Klor's can no longer compete with his competitors, the retailers in his marketing area with -- as to the product sold by these defendants to them but not to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.936" offset="5671163">While Klor's can't buy, he can't offer for resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.342" offset="5692792">And so he is necessarily eliminated as a competitor to those products.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.829" offset="5726647">Now, the illegality of that kind of restraint is not a novel or doubtful one, it goes back to the ancient common law precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.811" offset="5782653">Some of them dealing with physical fencing in of a competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.140" offset="5803969">Here, you have economic fencing here but it's the very type of thing which this Court has repeatedly said the Sherman Act condemns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.721" offset="5838242">When the matter first came up in Montague against Lowry in 193 U.S. in 1904, Mr. Justice Peckham's opinion for the Court didn't discuss the matter at any great length because he said the matter is -- is plain, it requires no elaboration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.505" offset="5925386">And there -- the -- the opinions of this Court which repeat that group boycotts, concerted refusals to deal agreements to refuse to supply are illegal per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.115" offset="6007829">Those opinions -- those cases are the landmarks to the antitrust law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.043" offset="6031548">The most recent statement to that effect appears in -- in the opinion of the Court last term in Northern Pacific Railway Company which is stated categorically without any qualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.944" offset="6079195">Now, maybe laboring the obvious to say that this case is a simple routine per se restraint case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.053" offset="6119633">But somehow that fact, that starting point of the -- of the case seems to have been perhaps overlooked in -- in the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.087" offset="6163728">And it seems to us that if -- if one accepts the proposition at the opinions of this Court compel that a restraint of this kind is inherently anti-competitive, inherently suppresses competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.489" offset="6265292">It solves the inquiry, it solves the question that was -- that is much -- much discussed in the opinion below as to the nature of the injury to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.608" offset="6317850">The public is necessarily injured as Congress itself has determined by making this kind of restraint illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.249" offset="6352332">Congress has determined that this is an injury to the public.</text>

            <text syncTime="1583.850" offset="6438745">I would say -- I would say that Judge Lawrence's opinion represents an attempt to blend two concepts in the antitrust law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.991" offset="6483362">The public injury concept, the rule of reason concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.502" offset="6505409">We believe that neither one of those is properly applicable to this kind of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.597" offset="6533726">As to the first public injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.091" offset="6547728">I think it might be -- it might suffice to rely on the opinion of the Court which condsidered this question, we believe, two terms ago in Radovich.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.117" offset="6595793">Now, the public injury doctrine rests on some general language appearing in three opinions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.556" offset="6653576">Those opinions are cited and quoted on page 29 of the respondent's brief, the white brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.912" offset="6703000">One is the opinion of Chief Justice White in the Wilder Manufacturing case in 1915.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.774" offset="6730480">That was case that very much involved in the problem that was before Your Honors in and Kelly against Kosuga, it's a -- it's a -- well, Sherman Act doesn't -- defends to a suit for a breach of contract case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.969" offset="6787218">The other, the second one is Mr. Justice Rutledge's opinion in 1948 in the Mandeville Farms case which involved the question of whether a conspiracy to fix prices among a group of sugar refineries violated the antitrust laws where its impact was on the growers of sugar beets in Northern California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.129" offset="6883871">Whether the sellers of product is as to which it was a price fixing combination had cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.500" offset="6917413">And the third, what the respondents called the key case is Apex Hosiery against Leader.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.667" offset="6946043">Mr. Justice as he was then, Mr. Justice Stone's opinion for the Court in that case involving a sitdown strike of workers which undoubtedly interrupted the interstate business, the interstate transportation of the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.806" offset="7014588">The question was, “Was that the kind of restraint of trade that the Sherman Act dealt with?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.436" offset="7037158">The answer the Court gave was no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.803" offset="7046562">Now, in the course of these three opinions, there is general language as to the scope of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.123" offset="7087835">And -- and the Court says that the Sherman Act doesn't deal merely with private injuries, it deals with public wrongs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.800" offset="7122526">That Congress has taken over the common law concept of -- of contracts and restraint of trade which were unenforceable and took that doctrine from the law of contracts and created a statutory wrong, a statutory tort, a statutory crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.092" offset="7219702">These were -- these were wrongs not merely against those hurt by the conduct, but they were wrongs against the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.082" offset="7251675">Now, that concept is of course unexceptionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.787" offset="7270484">No one quarrels with that description of -- of the -- of the nature of the Sherman Act but it's taking a long step to say public injure -- public wrong is to be equated with public injury, and public injury is to be equated with injury to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.676" offset="7338088">An injury to the public is not something that a court considers in construing the statute, but public injury is something that's to be demonstrated as a matter of fact by the plaintiff as part of his cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.324" offset="7392632">It has to be alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.922" offset="7399111">It has to be proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.046" offset="7407574">Now, in the Radovich case, which came before the Court two terms ago, the same cases had been used in the Ninth and Tenth Circuit in cases that it were -- are -- were referred to in the opinion of the Court of Appeals in the Radovich case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.434" offset="7481135">Those -- those lower court cases had developed this doctrine, particularly applicable to private treble damage actions that the plaintiff had to proof injury to the public as well as injury to them -- to himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.108" offset="7543829">And Judge Chambers and his opinion on the Radovich case said that -- perhaps, Radovich was hurt but the public wasn't hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.918" offset="7583013">The All American League for which he played and as to which he alleged the conspiracy, they were -- they were still in business, they weren't damaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.216" offset="7624286">So, said Judge Chambers, “there's no injury to the public.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.971" offset="7643303">Now, of course, the major question in the case when it came here was whether football is a business protected by the antitrust law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.543" offset="7681546">But there was a second basis of decision of -- of the Ninth Circuit to which the -- this Court in its opinion addressed itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.704" offset="7714147">And that was this contention that the plaintiff in a private damage action can't succeed merely by showing that he has been hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.712" offset="7758242">He has to show that the public has been hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.610" offset="7769840">And the answer given by the Court was simple, direct, clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.660" offset="7790007">The answer was that Congress has, by legislative fiat, determined that in -- that activities prohibited by the act are injurious to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.325" offset="7836714">Now, I should like if I may, to consider the practical implications of this -- of this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.722" offset="7878301">The -- as -- as Mr. Keith pointed out, here was a complaint not demurrable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.524" offset="7905468">No answer denying the allegations, having such an answer denied, the case have gone to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.161" offset="7928038">No answer giving an affirmative defense by way of business excuse or justification for it saying this was perfectly reasonable, it's a matter of business necessity, no defense of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.853" offset="7986761">Instead, what the defendants did was move for summary judgment on the basis of affidavits which they submitted to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.021" offset="8023437">Now, those affidavits are -- the substance of them is very graphically depicted in a chart which the -- the defendants have submitted to this Court which appears in their brief opposite page 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.261" offset="8076413">It's a map of the business district in which the plaintiffs -- the plaintiff and the defendants do business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.212" offset="8108178">And it shows Mission Street, number 2500 block of Mission Street, you'll -- there -- there, you'll find an arrow pointing towards Klor's, the plaintiff here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.624" offset="8157915">He's -- he was at 20 -- he was at 2581 and right next to him, not identified, is the defendant Hale, 2565.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.508" offset="8197413">And the basis of the -- the entire case here is -- is shown by this -- this chart that because there were these other retailers all selling the appliances which were denied by the defendants to the plaintiff because every -- these other retailers were still in business, still able to sell them to the public because there was no showing that the price to the consumers had been raised or that there had been any effect as to quantity or quality of the goods available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.601" offset="8333772">Because of that, courts below held that it was not conceivable, as a matter of law, that there was any injury to the plain -- to the public upon the -- upon the basis of which a violation of the Sherman Act could be made out.</text>

            <text syncTime="2109.848" offset="8542751">Now, the rule of -- the rule of reason which -- I'm not going to take Your Honors time to hold forth on, certainly does not permit a court to inquire as -- not as to the reasonableness of the restraint but as to who is hurt by the restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.651" offset="8649958">Mr. Justice Brandeis in his classic formulation of the rule of reason in the Chicago Board of Trade case in 264 U.S., I believe it is, says that the -- that every business agreement tends to restrain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.198" offset="8724146">It binds the -- the parties to the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.396" offset="8736998">They agreed not to do something that they would otherwise be freed to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.994" offset="8755388">Therefore, the true test of -- of legality is not whether an agreement restrains but whether the agreement is one that promotes competition, that regulates and fosters competition or whether it is one that suppresses or destroys it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.982" offset="8827277">Now, in this kind of case, necessarily, the -- the kind of restraint that you have here suppresses competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.877" offset="8866879">Conceivably, the rule of reason would permit a defense based upon a legitimate business aim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.898" offset="8902928">Conceivably, let -- let us say the defendants might have argued that they entered into this agreement because Klor's never paid his bills or because he rendered poor service to his customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.714" offset="8958203">Now, I would doubt very much whether it consistently with this Court's decisions as to the per se illegality of a group boycott, even that kind of defense had it been asserted would be valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.716" offset="9014209">I -- I should suppose that the Fashion Originators' Guild case where -- where the boycott was -- was allegedly for the purpose of meeting the unfair competition of style pirates and the Kiefer-Stewart case in 340 U.S. where the boycott was intended to meet the -- meet -- meet the competition of -- of others who are alleged to be violating the Sherman Act themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.489" offset="9149315">And in both cases, this Court said that's no defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.331" offset="9164675">I would suppose that kind of defense would not be sufficient here, but I think it's very important that the defendants didn't attempt to -- to make out any kind of excuse or justification under the rule of reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.261" offset="9212426">What they're saying here is that under the rule of reason, you can make a factual inquiry which is dispositive as to the existence of a cause of action as to whether, in addition to the plaintiffs being damaged, the public is being damaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.446" offset="9317125">Now, it because they apparently recognized the breadth to this argument, it would -- it would mean that a plaintiff who was eliminated entirely from the market, and this -- this complaint here alleges only that a great many suppliers into this conspiracy, not all of them, but suppose it had alleged that every manufacturer had refused to sell to Klor's with the effect that he was totally driven out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.741" offset="9438333">Well, the rationale of the decision below as Professor Handler has pointed out, in his discussion of this case in the New York City Bar Association Record, the rationale of this -- of this decision is that there's no injury to the public because you have all these other retailers around and you have no rise in prices, no -- or go no violation of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.375" offset="9528822">Now, the -- the defendants say, “Well, you can't carry it that far because if you've got price fixing, that is -- that is automatically a forbidden restraint, it is automatically injury to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.643" offset="9585977">Now, of course, one might answer that a group boycott is just as much a per se -- per se restraint as a -- as a price fixing agreement, but -- but apart from that, the argument, it seems to us, emphasizes the incongruity and one might even say the absurdity of the -- of the line that sought to be drawn here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.330" offset="9688691">Because suppose this -- this complaint, instead of alleging that there was an unqualified refusal to sell to Klor's, suppose it had alleged that they had qualified it, that these manufacturers have gotten together and they had said, “Well, we'll sell to Klor's but only on condition that he pay 5% more than every other retailer in San Francisco pay.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.236" offset="9792345">Now, under the respondent's theory, that's price fixing and it's public injury, you don't have to prove that anybody besides Klor's was -- was hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.052" offset="9835604">And yet, in that situation, the -- the public wouldn't -- wouldn't be affected to any greater extent than here and I suppose they'd be better off because Klor's would still be in business and he would have to compete with his neighbors and he couldn't raise prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.201" offset="9936227">And -- so that -- so that the practical matter under the -- under the theory here, a qualified refusal to sell produces one result, and an unqualified refusal which is even worse, produces another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.290" offset="9996518">Now, if there's one act on the -- on the books which shouldn't be construed in such a -- a mechanical way, I should suppose it was the Sherman Act, the whole --</text>

            <text syncTime="2941.391" offset="11868975">The question in this case is not whether George Klor or Klor's Incorporated has a cause of action for some kind of tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.963" offset="11907218">He may have.</text>

            <text syncTime="2955.807" offset="11926549">The question here is whether he has a cause of action to claim for relief under a statute which was enacted for some very important purposes of the Sherman antitrust law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.298" offset="11968554">Now, I'm quite gratified with Mr. Elman's argument because he's going to permit me to come into a very close issue with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.772" offset="11998438">And of course, I'm disturbed that this little case of my client turns out to be one in which it is contended there are large issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.249" offset="12032397">I don't believe there are any large issues and I'm convinced that the case was decided upon what has been elementary law for many years.</text>

            <text syncTime="2992.581" offset="12073671">And if you'll permit me to state it, I'll state it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.855" offset="12086836">It's whether the Sherman Act is down to be reduced to a sort of section, a self-evasion of a federal commercial code dealing with the private law of commercial torts because for a suit, there may be interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.914" offset="12138977">Congress could have enacted that kind of law but I shall submit it didn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.347" offset="12156740">Now, I'm not admitting that there's interstate commerce involved and if my time permits, I'll come to that later.</text>

            <text syncTime="3099.511" offset="12501452">First, we had a pretrial conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.984" offset="12511274">We went in on a motion and it was converted to a pretrial hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.744" offset="12526320">And as a consequence to this pretrial hearing in the motion, the issue is one which at that time, all the parties agreed on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.406" offset="12561011">Of course, we didn't agree when they answered to the issue, but we agreed upon the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.445" offset="12581177">What we did with our affidavits was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.031" offset="12591522">We assumed that there was sufficient allegation of conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.095" offset="12607718">We assumed it because you cannot, on a motion for summary judgment, ever litigate that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.203" offset="12632168">The existence of a conspiracy may be proved by a wide latitude of evidence, you can't dispose of it in a summary fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.332" offset="12660694">So we assumed the existence of a conspiracy, but we struck at what we conceived to be and what both courts below have agreed with us was the jugular vein of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.214" offset="12700191">We filed -- each respondent filed an affidavit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3153.655" offset="12717955">Not only weren't they denied, they were admitted, they were directly admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.444" offset="12741151">And the issue as it finally came down after pruning out -- this complaint was 103 pages long, to start with, 40 counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.676" offset="12774066">I just followed Robinson-Patman allegations and it was finally pruned out by the pretrial order into this kind of issue as stated by the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3242.108" offset="13071757">Now, let me define this matter even more specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.993" offset="13083355">In the first place, this case does not involve all brands of these products, radios, phonographs, televisions, refrigerators, so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.370" offset="13116897">Only a small fraction are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.504" offset="13129435">Our affidavits showed that there were over 20 major brands in the United States of radios, phonographs and televisions being sold in San Francisco not involved in this case, which it was not alleged that the defendants prevented plaintiff from getting any of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.384" offset="13188890">Over 18 brands of refrigerators, 23 brands of stoves, 30 brands of washers and dryers, all on the average something like six to seven times as many brands of these various appliances not involved in this case as were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.218" offset="13256286">And as was said in the Court of Appeals' opinion, it's 159, among these competing brands are many of the outstanding and most widely advertised brands in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.256" offset="13300381">And if I were to read the names then that the Court used, it would look like the blue book of American business, Capehart, Crosley, Du Mont, Hallicrafter, Magnavox, Motorola, Packard-Bell, Westinghouse, Bendix, I'm just skipping over, and Frigidaire, International Harbor, and so on and so forth, not involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.932" offset="13371120">And as Judge Barnes went on to say, “The appellant does not charge that it was denied the right to handle any of these vast number of brands manufactured and sold by companies not parties to the action.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.745" offset="13418350">And so, I say in the first place, if the Court pleases, that a certain statement that sometimes appears in the briefs of my adversaries, about the elimination of a competitor, simply should be swept aside as an improper intruder in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.616" offset="13473834">There was no conspiracy alleged about eliminating the plaintiff as a competitor because he had available far more brands than the few involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.187" offset="13516152">Now, the next significant fact of this case and nobody ever disputed this when we were arguing at the District Court, nor was it ever disputed when we were in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.331" offset="13552724">These cases have a habit of producing new arguments the higher you get, but not until we got up here was it suggested that this conspiracy was aimed at anybody but the petitioner alone?</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.835" offset="13598699">And again, I refer to what Judge Barnes said, that's 178 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.112" offset="13615835">He says, “The conduct here was conduct directed at this plaintiff and only at this plaintiff.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.556" offset="13641644">It wasn't aimed at anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.587" offset="13649690">It wasn't aimed at the market, any other retailer, any other wholesaler or the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.661" offset="13670066">And if one were to examine the complaint which appears in the record about -- about pages 9, 10 and 11, you'll find that the allegation of the complaint was that my client, Broadway-Hale, persuaded the other defendants to deny to plaintiff certain articles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.325" offset="13748642">It didn't persuade them to deny anybody else but to plaintiff.</text>

            <text syncTime="4540.831" offset="18266676">He was trying to lay down some universal principles.</text>

            <text syncTime="4545.362" offset="18284857">Number two, he was being careful to say that they were principles that were not confined to labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4551.491" offset="18309308">Number three, he was very -- he -- he use language which as I have just read it, fully applies to the commercial situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4561.527" offset="18349432">In other words, I say the distinction isn't between a commercial case and a non-commercial because he said restraint on competition or on the course of trade in the merchandising of articles.</text>

            <text syncTime="4619.035" offset="18579519">But on the other hand from the earliest time this same thing has been read into the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4624.049" offset="18599581">Now, the conclusions we've arrived at , after a little brief submitted, we've arrived at to Apex which I've always considered as a rather more refined expression of the rule that this Court had been coming to for a long period of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4636.781" offset="18650467">For example, back in the Corn Products case which was decided in 1914 many years before -- before Apex, the Court had expressed it somewhat differently having reached it from Standard Oil through Justice Holmes' opinion in the Nash case and so on where he said, where the Court said that the prohibitions of the statue were enacted to prevent not the mere injury to an individual but the arm to the general public which would be occasioned by the evils which it was contemplated, would be prevented.</text>
            <text syncTime="4670.836" offset="18786722">And hence, the prohibitions of the statue were coextensive with such conceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4675.740" offset="18806366">And then Mr. Justice Rutledge in Mandeville case in 1948, we expressed the same when he said that the test of the private parties' right to recovery under the react is whether the statute's policy has been violated in the manner to produce the general consequence it forbids for the public and a special consequence for the particular individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="4697.407" offset="18892988">Now, it is true I have not found, I don't believe I have found any case in this Court but there are a multitude, there is a multitude of cases in the lower courts that have dealt with precisely this problem -- I'll go further.</text>
            <text syncTime="4712.428" offset="18953070">There are cases, everyone of them, where the plaintiffs' rights were much stouter than they were here, stronger cases and yet without a single exception, the lower courts starting as far back as in the 30s have held that in this particular kind of case, the plaintiff had no rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4728.604" offset="19017749">And when I say this particular kind of case, I mean a case where a particular dealer, sales agent, consignee, distributor of some kind handling the product is driven out by virtual conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4745.945" offset="19087130">And yet the Court say, “Well, there are many other brands available?</text>
            <text syncTime="4750.972" offset="19107297">The public hasn't been hurt, you can't say any competition has been affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="4755.617" offset="19125791">I think it was the Third Circuit (Inaudible) where the courts made in the seventh -- where the courts -- it would be effect on competition is like the effect on the temperature of a light of match in all outdoors.”</text>

            <text syncTime="4994.773" offset="20082500">As far back as the -- the Abeloff case in -- which came up in San Francisco in 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="5002.169" offset="20112071">Precisely this case, a group of defendants were charged of having conspired not to sell to the plaintiff dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5007.113" offset="20131819">And it was, held no public injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="5010.123" offset="20143835">Then there's the famous Shotkin case from the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5013.968" offset="20159195">Any defendants, General Electric, Westinghouse and their distributors, as the counterpart of this case which is the counterpart of that, were accused of having conspired not to sell to the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="5025.389" offset="20204962">That case was decided on the pleadings and it was held so what, he could get other products and there were numerous other dealers involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5035.117" offset="20243832">This concept of the public injury has been criticized as having been upset by the Radovich case which of course is Justice Clark's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5045.652" offset="20285942">Now, before taking up the opinion itself, may I suggest that no lower court, no lower court at all has considered that the Radovich case outlawed or swept away the public injury concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="5060.214" offset="20344247">The Eighth Circuit in the Regal case, and curiously enough, the -- the -- I think it's the third, Miller Motors case in 252 F 2d, which I think is interesting to note because the Solicitor General appears against me and that opinion was by Judge Sobeloff who was the predecessor Solicitor General and he states the public injury point as if it still -- still the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5084.317" offset="20440691">That -- this was just the other day, 252, F.2d.</text>
            <text syncTime="5092.487" offset="20473292">Therefore, there will be no showing of any public injury resulting from a restraint of commerce and automobiles or advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="5098.413" offset="20497011">It cannot be said that the Sherman Act has been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5101.862" offset="20510804">The hybrid nature of a private antitrust suit dictates that to succeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5105.799" offset="20526582">The plaintiff must prove not only that the defendant has infringed one or more of the antitrust laws to the public injury but also that the infringement has resulted in private injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="5115.707" offset="20566183">Now, let me -- let me turn to the Radovich case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5119.996" offset="20583320">The respondents in the Radovich case presented a very curious argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5124.142" offset="20599933">They said in effect that the plaintiff in a private suit must allege and prove more than the Government must prove in a Government suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5133.310" offset="20636609">They said in addition to showing a violation of the Sherman Act, they must prove a public injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="5139.371" offset="20660851">And the Court's answer to that is as it should have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="5141.976" offset="20671300">If you have a proof of violation, you prove the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5146.675" offset="20690108">But the question is what constitutes a violation?</text>
            <text syncTime="5150.888" offset="20706931">And this is -- reference has been made to -- to Milton Handler -- Milton Handler article discusses the Klor's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5158.254" offset="20736397">And he says that what Judge Barnes did and seemed to him to be correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="5164.148" offset="20760012">You cannot divorce that question of the effect upon the public from the concept of what is a violation of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5171.295" offset="20788537">You don't have to prove something in addition to violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5174.439" offset="20801076">You don't have to come into court with any formulistic set of words in the complaint that there has been a public injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="5180.954" offset="20827199">If you allege the kind of action which from its nature is deleterious to the public like price fixing, reducing quantity available, you have automatically alleged the kind of restraint which is -- has a public injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="5197.802" offset="20894595">If having alleged it, you prove your allegations, you proved your case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5203.713" offset="20918209">But if your allegation in your case is one which is not in and of its essential nature deleterious to the public, then you've got to go further and show what's involved.</text>
