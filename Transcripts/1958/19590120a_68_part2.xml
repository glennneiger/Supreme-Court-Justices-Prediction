            <text syncTime="9.040" offset="139577">They adopted what was then and is now, the vogue in rate regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.219" offset="160266">That is the filed rate theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.175" offset="172074">The seller of the service fixes a rate, files it with the Commission, it becomes effective, the Commission's control is a legislative control to alter it for the future, either on complaint or on its own motion, that's all spelled out by this Court very recently in the Mobile case and again to some extent in the Memphis case.</text>

            <text syncTime="40.319" offset="264652">In this respect Part II differs in Part I of these (Voice Overlap) --</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Bryce Rea, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="43.388" offset="276877">In this respect, Part II differs from Part I and that brings me, Mr. Justice Harlan, to the root of the holding of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.935" offset="319091">The court first said Montana-Dakota doesn't apply here, because all the Montana-Dakota case held was that a complaint to a federal District Court that a rate charged by a regulated power company was unreasonable in the past, states no cause of action under the Federal Power Act, therefore, said the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court dismissed the complaint there being no diversity of citizenship between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.702" offset="458167">We submit that the Court's holding is far broader than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.096" offset="471751">It did not, we submit, take this case to determine whether or not, or to delimit rather, federal jurisdiction in the sense of delimiting the jurisdiction of District Courts, since your course -- or courts have limited jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.165" offset="528071">The holding is squarely this, as we see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.547" offset="545520">The right to a reasonable rate is the right to the rate that's filed and effective with the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.093" offset="575718">No court can authorize any other rate, so no court can entertain a cause of action claiming a right to another rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.360" offset="608841">The Commission cannot authorize any other rate as a judicial matter respecting any period in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.860" offset="642800">The Commission's authority is the legislative authority to fix rates for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.574" offset="661713">Therefore, to hold that a cause of action existed, would be to say that the Court can entertain a cause of action in which it can decide no issue, then the Commission can entertain a complaint which the statute does not permit it to entertain namely, a complaint directed to the past rates, then the Commission can make a finding and then the Court can go ahead and render a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.967" offset="755231">In other words, it would be saying, we submit, to read the Montana case as the court below read it that the absence of power in the courts, coupled with the absence of power in the Commission, can somehow create power in both of them together.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.031" offset="819493">The Government's argument and shippers arguments generally, they go into the Court, they file their suit and the Court said, "We can't determine what's an unreasonable rate."</text>
            <text syncTime="189.660" offset="862020">The shipper then runs over to the Interstate Commerce Commission and files a complaint alleging that this rate was unreasonable in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.102" offset="891800">Of course, there's no authority in the Commission's act authorizing it to make adjudications as to the past, but the shipper says, "Oh, the Court has a cause of action pending."</text>
            <text syncTime="208.685" offset="938088">You therefore, as a collaborative instrument of justice, to use Justice Frankfurter's phrase in the Montana-Dakota case, can rend, make a finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.209" offset="972257">Well, as the majority held and as Justice Frankfurter speaking for the majority -- speaking for the minority agreed, where you have properly filed rates, no allegation of fraudulent filing, such as was present in Montana-Dakota and is not present here, the whole theory of rate regulation is premised on the proposition that errors in rates, unreasonable rates, will be corrected by prospective action by the Commission in the proscription of other rates for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.950" offset="1115199">Now, the Court of Appeals and respondent here, then go over and argue after all, there is a cause of action against a rail carrier which codifies the rail --- the shipper's common-law right to a reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.455" offset="1205164">There must be also such a right against the common carrier by motor and they make two arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.194" offset="1232123">They say first, the declaration in the Act, that rates shall be just and reasonable, creates a right, creates a cause of action in a shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.550" offset="1293563">They admit that the Act provides no method for its enforcement, but they say we can improvise the method namely, suit by the shipper in a common-law court or in a -- in a common-law court followed by reference of the issue of reasonableness to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.949" offset="1383215">But we submit that Part I, regulating rail carriers and its specific provisions go far toward negativing any intention on the part of the Congress to create similar rights under Part II in regulating motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.901" offset="1462941">Part I, to begin with, Section 8, specifically says that "Anybody damaged by anything done by a rail carrier in violation of the Act, shall have redress in damages."</text>
            <text syncTime="352.445" offset="1513200">Section 9 provides that the shipper may either complain to the Commission pursuant to the complaint section which is 13 (1) or may sue in a federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.280" offset="1576521">Section 13 provides for the filing of complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.744" offset="1590314">Section 16 provides for the issuance of orders by the Commission determining the amount of damages any person has suffered by a railroad's violation of the Act and the issuance of an order to compel payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.350" offset="1648724">Section 16 (2), provides that if the railroad fails to obey the Commission's order and make payment within the time specified in the order, the shipper may file suit in the District Court and plead the order of the Commission as the gravamen of his complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.986" offset="1723329">Section 16 (4), provides a statute of limitations within which the shipper must bring his complaint for damages for the exaction of an unreasonable rate in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.753" offset="1778395">None of those provisions are found in Part II of the Act relating to motor carriers, not a single comparable provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.083" offset="1815698">The only reference to any private redress for alleged violations of the Act in Part II, is the provision that suits for overcharges to recover overcharges, which are defined to exclude charges based on applicable rates and properly computed.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.430" offset="1901066">It must be brought within two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.893" offset="1910993">There is no provision, whatever, for any private redress.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.678" offset="1934085">The redress for violations of the Act is carefully limited to actions by the Commission to compel enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.125" offset="1983822">That is Section 222 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="474.140" offset="1999914">And interestingly enough, the Supreme Court of Oregon, which considered this question of the right of private redress for alleged violations of the Act very recently, the case is discussed at length in our reply brief, which was filed today.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.460" offset="2077236">That's Consolidated Freightways versus United Truck Lines cited by the Supreme Court of Oregon this past October and recorded in 330 P.2d 522.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.258" offset="2128436">In that case, the Supreme Court of Oregon examined the legislative history of the Act at great length.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.039" offset="2163545">And it pointed out that the original proposed act did provide that in the event of a violation of any of the provisions, any person injured or the Commission had a cause of action to enforce the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.200" offset="2248182">When the Act was enacted in the following year, that provision for private redress by individuals, persons injured was stricken and the Supreme Court of Oregon goes on to discuss the thinking of the Congress that they were taking under regulation, some 10,000 motor carriers in a completely chaotic state in 1935, when the whole problem, as the Government says in its brief, was to raise their rates from the -- on economic levels at which they've understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.021" offset="2411499">That facing for the first time as Mr. Eastman who was then Coordinator of Transportation, testified about the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.834" offset="2438666">The Commission was faced with some terrific regulatory problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.689" offset="2454131">So that it was quite logical and sensible that they confined redress for alleged violations of the Act to the Commission, so that the development of the regulation of motor carriers, which was being taken over then for the first time, would proceed in an orderly way.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.220" offset="2544201">Certainly, the Congress as the Government said had the background of Part I, dealing with rail carriers before it, at the time it enacted Part II in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.030" offset="2595506">If it had intended to give shippers by motor carriers, the same rights to damages that it had earlier given shippers by railroad, it's inconceivable that it would have conferred that cause of action by the simple declaration that unjust rates are unlawful, unjust and unreasonable rates are unlawful, when it had before it and at the very time it amend, it past the Motor Carrier Act, amended Part I, it had before it all of those elaborate provisions for damages against rail carriers.</text>

            <text syncTime="666.494" offset="2769377">Do outline in Part I correspond in all its essential respects with the provision of the Federal Power Act?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bryce_rea_jr" startTime="673.441" stopTime="1173.168">
            <label>Mr. Bryce Rea, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="673.441" offset="2797171">No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.484" offset="2801351">The scheme in Part I corresponds with the scheme in Part III.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.317" offset="2820681">Part I, of course, is the early act beginning in 1887, dealing with railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.763" offset="2842415">In 1935, the Congress passed the Federal Power Act and it passed the Motor Carrier Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.921" offset="2867075">Those two are identical in their substantive provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.688" offset="2882121">The scheme is the same that provisions are, in many respects, so far as it's possible for them to be word for word.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.938" offset="2907094">In 1940, the Commission brought -- I beg your pardon, the Congress brought under regulation the water carriers, common carriers by water, and interestingly enough, 18 -- the old act of Part I begun in 1887, makes elaborate provisions for reparations by shippers charged unreasonable rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.398" offset="2992985">1935, the Congress passes the Federal Power Act and the Motor Carrier Act neither contain any provisions for reparations both limit the Commission to this legislative function of fixing rates for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.369" offset="3040841">In 1940, five years later, the Congress enacted Part III of the Act bringing common carriers by water, certain of them, within the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.575" offset="3085667">It went back to the scheme of Part I and Part III, enacted in 1940, contains precisely the elaborate provisions for reparations that are contained in Part I.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.787" offset="3154526">I'd like to make this point to the Court of Appeals, spoke in terms of the right they thought existed from the declaration that rates be -- must --- must be just and reasonable, which as this Court held in the Montana cases, a criterion for administrative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.563" offset="3245641">It's a standard by which rates are regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.280" offset="3256508">It is not the creation of a justiciable right.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.848" offset="3274794">But they also went on to say that after all, at common-law, there was a right to a reasonable rate enforceable as to the past in a common-law court.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.641" offset="3329964">We submit, and we think we demonstrated in our brief, that there could not have been a common-law right to a reasonable rate for the interstate movement of goods because there is no federal common-law.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.894" offset="3398928">The recognition of such a right would mean that a state court, under state law, would determine the reasonableness of rates for interstate transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.488" offset="3445321">And certainly, it's been held as from the Wabash case, forward that there is no state authority who'll regulate rates and the existence of a common-law right which requires state action for the implementation -- for the determination of the reasonable rate, in our view, would be to give the states power that they don't have under the Constitution, namely, the right to fix rates for interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.072" offset="3583666">The Government's principal reliance, in its brief, is on this Court's recent decision in Western Pacific, the Western Pacific case -- Western Pacific versus the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.114" offset="3635806">And I just like to make this distinction which we think is patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.165" offset="3672064">In the Western Pacific case, the General Accounting Office deducted alleging that particular rates on what the carriers classified as aerial bombs were not proper because the items transported were not bombs at all, they were napalm gel.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.079" offset="3763702">The carrier brought suit in the Court of Claims to recover the amounts deducted by the General Accounting Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.129" offset="3799855">The Government alleged that the rates were inapplicable and if in -- if applicable, unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.475" offset="3853249">The Court of Claims disallowed the defense on the ground that it could not determine whether the rates were reasonable and that the statute of limitations in Section 16 of the Act which provides for the filing of complaints for damages with the Commission, had run, was applicable to the Government and barred the Commission from considering the matter of the reasonableness of the rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.907" offset="3974980">This Court reversed and remanded the case to the Court of Claims with directions to refer the issue to the Commission, but this Court's position was that in that case, there was no distinction in practicality between the allegation that the rates were inapplicable and the allegation that the rates were unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.288" offset="4092531">It took the view that the Government's position was that the rates were inapplicable and that one reason the Government maintain that they were inapplicable is that --- that because their use would produce an unreasonable result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.711" offset="4150209">Now, we think that all that case holds is that where a tariff is ambiguous, you can resort to parole evidence namely, you can examine the result of one construction as opposed to the result of another to ascertain its applicability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.584" offset="4233697">But in any event, that case proceeded on the perfectly proper premise that a shipper did have, under Part I of the Interstate Commerce Act, a right to a reasonable rate even though different than the file and effective rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.475" offset="4329305">So there was no question whatever raised at any point, but that the Interstate Commerce Commission had fundamental jurisdiction bestowed on it by Part I to ascertain whether or not, that rate charged in that past period was reasonable and that the shipper had bestowed upon him by Part I, a right to recover damages if he had been charged an unreasonable rate, but to cite or to rely as the Government does on that case here, is to beg the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.822" offset="4466709">It is to assume the answer to the very question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.880" offset="4478934">It is to assume that there is a justiciable legal right to some rate other than the filed and effective rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.916" offset="4515088">And that's the question before Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.231" offset="4524283">Is there such a right?</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.775" offset="4530448">We submit that there is not that the Interstate Commerce Act, Part II or the Motor Carrier Act of 1935, makes it perfectly clear that the Congress was adopting the scheme of the Federal Power Act, enacted in the same time and the Natural Gas Act, enacted three years later in 1938, which calls for the filing of rates and limits the rate regulatory authority of the Commission to the fixing of rates for the future on the assumption as Justice Frankfurter pointed out in the Montana case that if rates filed initially by the carrier in the exercise of his discretion turn are found to be unreasonable or are unreasonable, they will be quickly corrected by the proscription of new rates for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.378" offset="4760848">I'd like to reserve what's time we have.</text>

            <text syncTime="1188.608" offset="4857814">The facts are slightly different in the T. I. M. E. case with the Davidson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.354" offset="4880802">The T. I. M. E. case arose out of some shipments from Oklahoma City Tinker Air Force Base near in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, to another air force base at Planehaven, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.962" offset="4931271">The tariff which prescribed rates for that movement was the Rocky Mountain Motor Freight Tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.764" offset="4958438">And it named the rate from Planehaven or from Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma to Planehaven, California, at so many cents per hundred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.034" offset="5003473">T. I. M. E. was a party to another tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.972" offset="5019251">And maybe, I should explain to the Court, perhaps the Court knows more about the way these tariffs are made up than I do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.184" offset="5052061">But in the early growth of the trucking industry, almost all carriers were small localized carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.699" offset="5090200">And when it became necessary under the Motor Carrier Act for them to file tariffs, they joined together and formed these local associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.529" offset="5133458">It happens that my client now, operates from Los Angeles, California to Atlanta, Georgia and Cincinnati, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.274" offset="5164492">In order to comply with all of those different local situations, it is now the member of 28 different tariff bureaus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.026" offset="5195525">Among the other tariff bureaus that it was a member of, it was a member of the Southwestern Motor Freight Bureau, which names rates generally between Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana, El Paso, Texas and some small part of Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.716" offset="5258219">It was also the member of another tariff bureau which is the Interstate Tariff Bureau which names right between California on the one hand, El Paso, Texas and certain other territories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.355" offset="5320808">The Government's position in this case is not that this rate is too high because it calls for too much money, but the Government's contention is that this rate is too high because there is a rate from Tinker Air Force Base to El Paso, plus another rate on another tariff from El Paso, Texas to Planehaven, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.088" offset="5419760">And that the sum total of those two rates is less than this through rate named in the Rocky Mountain Tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.254" offset="5464377">The position of the court below was that first, that they were entitled to the aggregate of intermediates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.765" offset="5494471">And secondly, if the through rate was the applicable rate, then because it had exceeded the aggregate of intermediates that it was too high and unreasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1373.743" offset="5598333">El Paso, Texas is a gateway to Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.059" offset="5611604">And freight has predominantly moved from the West through El Paso.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.303" offset="5636577">So carriers going into El Paso needed tonnage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.237" offset="5652355">Carriers going from El Paso to California needed tonnage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.279" offset="5668446">And that is the only explanation that I know, I've seen no factual figures on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.178" offset="5696136">But any event, they asked the court then to hold this judgment in abeyance, in other words, the local -- the District Judge have said.</text>

            <text syncTime="1412.413" offset="5752978">So then the Government said, "Well, if the Court please, will you hold this in abeyance now, that want to file a complaint with the Interstate Commerce Commission which is not provided for by law at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.442" offset="5809089">And we want to ascertain whether or not this rate is reasonable or unreasonable."</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.472" offset="5833226">The District Court refused that idea and went to the Fifth Circuit and of course, the court below, following Western Pacific said that the case should be referred through the Interstate Commerce Commission for their decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.100" offset="5895816">Now, the point I should like to make to this Court, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.998" offset="5915355">This case involves reparations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.478" offset="5925282">Whether the Government -- in the T. I. M. E. case, they -- they'd simply paid the aggregate of intermediates and never get paid the through rate at all, and thus, to suit against the Government for the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.184" offset="5980139">And that is what the lawsuit is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.076" offset="5995708">But the point I'd like to make to this Court is that this is a suit for reparation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.118" offset="6019845">And what the Government is asking this Court to do is to say to a hundred thousand shippers that views our freight limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.308" offset="6064567">That in spite of the fact that you follow the administrative procedure and filed your tariff as prescribed below and in spite of the fact that there hasn't been any complaint filed, and in spite of the fact that the Commission itself has done nothing about it, that even after you have followed the administrative process that you as a shipper may ship within the period of limitations, accepting this -- the -- the existing rate, the applicable rate and then somewhere down the line, if you decide that that rate is too high, that you refuse to pay and then you require the carrier to sue you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.898" offset="6242931">And then when the carriers sued upon the only rate that exists on earth, the shippers says your rate is too high.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.001" offset="6283368">And while we want this question adjudicated by the Interstate Commerce Commission because it involves money, well, it's simply a straight-out proposition for reparations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2499.277" offset="10100485">I wouldn't -- the outset -- I tried to straighten out this question of, through rate versus the aggregate of intermediate rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.407" offset="10148968">Mr. Benson is absolutely correct in suggesting that the so-called applicable rate in this controversy is the through rate, even though it exceeds by almost 100%, the combination of intermediate rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.009" offset="10231411">This is, by virtue, of an I.C.C. regulation which Mr. Justice Douglas adverted to as appearing at the top of page 11 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.450" offset="10281148">That doesn't mean, however -- and this is -- this is the -- I think a very important distinction to -- to bear in mind simply because a rate is called, applicable in I.C.C. parlance, it doesn't necessarily follow that that's the reasonable rate or the just rate or the one which is allowed by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.548" offset="10373517">In fact, the I.C.C. in a consistent series of decisions dating back to the very enactment of the Motor Carriers Act, Part II of the Interstate Commerce Act with which we are here concerned, has always held -- has always held that wherever a shipper can show that an aggregate of intermediates is less than the through rate, the through rate is prima facie unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.237" offset="10468289">And of course, that's the question we want to get over to the Commission in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4072.468" offset="16393279">Because the Western Pacific case involved precisely the situation I've tried to point that is now before the Court, thereto, carriers claimed certain funds from the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4083.520" offset="16437478">The Government resisted on the ground that the charges the carriers were demanding where excessive and unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4093.187" offset="16476139">The Court of Claims before whom the litigation had been instituted by the rail carriers in that case, threw up its hands, it said, "Well, Government defends on unreasonableness, unreasonableness is a problem we can't cope with.</text>
            <text syncTime="4109.421" offset="16541027">That ever since the Interstate Commerce Act is a problem which necessarily must be adjudicated by the central body, by the great agency having the expertise, by the Interstate Commerce Commission."</text>
            <text syncTime="4121.154" offset="16587943">So the Court of Claims said, “We can't pass on that problem of unreasonableness.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4124.562" offset="16601631">Well, then, we said, “Well if you can't pass on it, will you please refer the matter over to the Interstate Commerce Commission so that we will be able to have an opportunity over there to establish our defensive unreasonableness.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4135.482" offset="16645308">The Court of Claims felt too, that that request had to be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="4139.435" offset="16661086">And the reason for it is precisely the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="4143.103" offset="16675819">The referral was denied in -- in Montana-Dakota, by the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4147.011" offset="16691388">And is precisely the reason that the carriers here insist that referral is improvident, namely, in the Court of Claims, it was ruled that there could be no referral by the Court of Claims of this question of this defensive unreasonableness in Interstate Commerce Commission, because of the fact that the United States Government was precluded from filing an independent reparation proceeding before the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4173.421" offset="16797027">In that case, the reason that the Government was precluded, the Court said, was because the statute of limitations had run and destroyed the Government's right to go before the Interstate Commerce Commission in the independent reparation proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4185.171" offset="16844048">Well, when this Court took the case, this Court, in reversing the Court of Claims, went to pains to point out that the fact that the Government could not file independent reparation proceeding before the Interstate Commerce Commission was completely immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4200.825" offset="16906637">Here, the Government was asking for -- of opportunity for adjudication of the defensive unreasonableness, a defense which ever since the passage of the Interstate Commerce Act with respect to rail carriers in 1887 with respect to Motor Carries since 1935, necessarily, must be aired before the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4220.208" offset="16984168">And this Court directed, in reversing, it directed the Court of Claims to afford us an opportunity to air that defense before the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4229.687" offset="17022098">I don't see that that's really any different, Your Honors, from a situation where a plaintiff and a (Inaudible) comes into court and he says, “Well look, the defendant has been negligent and I want damages.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4239.885" offset="17062954">And the court saying, "Well -- the defendant saying at that point, “Well, but look, you've been contributory negligent.</text>
