            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 581, William W. Burns, Petitioner, versus State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.096" offset="151803">Mrs. Washington.</text>

            <label>Ms. Helen G. Washington</label>
            <text syncTime="16.548" offset="169566">May it please the Court, my argument will be very brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.849" offset="194748">As in Griffin against Illinois and Eskridge against Washington State Prison Board recently decided by this Court, this case concerns an indigent convicted defendant who was deprived of the appeal rights given him by state law, solely because he was too poor to pay one of the costs of appeal, here the docket fee demanded in advance for docketing his appeal papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.042" offset="367574">As in the Griffin and Eskridge case the only question is whether the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibited the state from denying appeal rights given to others, to one who does not have the money to pay the cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.755" offset="474363">The details giving rise to this question maybe quickly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.442" offset="497142">The petitioner was convicted by a jury of a felony in a trial court in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.948" offset="535176">He was sentenced to life imprisonment in the state penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.441" offset="557119">Upon an appeal to the Intermediate Court of Appeals, his conviction was affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.430" offset="593063">Ohio Law gave him further appeal rights in the Supreme Court of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.615" offset="629844">Under the law there is an appeal as of right if a constitutional question is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.415" offset="660982">In other cases one whose conviction of a felony has been affirmed by the Court of Appeals, may move the Supreme Court of Ohio for leave to appeal and will have leave granted if good cause for the appeal is shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.659" offset="746036">The state statute and the rules of the Supreme Court provide, however, for the payment of the docket fee of $20 before the appeal papers will be docketed.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.306" offset="824613">This petitioner who was in the penitentiary without the assistant of counsel prepared a motion for leave to appeal, a motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and then affidavit of poverty.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.803" offset="902562">He transmitted these papers to the Supreme Court of Ohio together with a copy of the notice of appeal filed in the Court of Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.125" offset="947911">The Supreme Court, acting through its clerk, immediately returned his papers to him, with the explanation that the docket fee required by statute and the Court's rule had not have been paid and that an appeal in forma pauperis was not an acceptable substitute.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.507" offset="1045400">Thus the Supreme Court of Ohio construed the statute and its rules as denying access through the Court to those who were unable to pay the fee, although everyone else could have his appeal docketed.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.704" offset="1150203">Under the Griffin and Eskridge decision such a discriminatory interpretation of the statute cannot stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.644" offset="1201925">Since Ohio has a general policy of allowing appeals, or appeal rights in the Supreme Court, it under those decisions cannot consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment deny them to one who does not have the money to pay the cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.897" offset="1298996">I don't think I need to elaborate anymore on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.658" offset="1318013">We rest our case on the decisions in the Griffin and Eskridge cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.344" offset="1352704">On brief the state advances only one reason why those cases should not apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.259" offset="1392410">The state says that the petitioner has had one appeal here, his conviction was affirmed and that he is not entitled to anything more, that when Ohio does give a second appeal it can establish any conditions for it that it sees fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.106" offset="1495751">I think that this is a misreading of Griffin.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.592" offset="1509752">The teaching of that case certainly is that if a state does grant appeal, it should grant it to rich and poor alike, that would be regardless of the level at which appeal was, regardless of whether it was the first, second or tenth appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.092" offset="1591777">And we submit that this case could return to the Supreme Court of Ohio with appropriate instructions to give petitioner his rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="392.183" offset="1672129">Mr. Chief Justice and justices, please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.749" offset="1694386">I think the whole question before this Court here is whether or not the effect of Griffin should be extended because in Griffin under the statues of the State of Illinois, felony cases are appealed only and directly to the Supreme Court of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.719" offset="1786232">Misdemeanor cases are appealed to the appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.584" offset="1809742">Before our case can be appealed or considered on appeal by the Supreme Court of the State of Illinois, they had to have a transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.578" offset="1845687">Griffin had no transcript and he said he had no money to buy one, therefore, his case was heard in lower court one appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.064" offset="1883617">In Ohio it is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.388" offset="1892916">Our primary appellate court is the Court of Appeals, a three-judge court of which we have ten in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.497" offset="1937324">In this case Burns was convicted in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.765" offset="1958431">He had self retained counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.208" offset="1968253">He was not a poor man.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.244" offset="1976299">He appealed to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.508" offset="2145364">He had his transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.411" offset="2145259">He got a full appellate review before the Court of Appeals and his case was affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.375" offset="2145155">Now at that stage, he filed a notice of appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.678" offset="2145050">He did the necessary administrative step two of notifying the prosecuting attorney before he filed his application for an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.012" offset="2144946">At that time as I say he apparently was not indigent, he had his own self retained counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.733" offset="2150275">He went out and he had his review.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.602" offset="2161768">He dropped and abandoned, at that time that contemplated appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.313" offset="2192593">It was not until years later after Griffin, the Griffin decision had been announced and after he had spent those intervening years in the penitentiary where whatever resources that he might have had when he first went in were undoubtedly dissipated and he was in truth and in fact a pauper, that he then goes and without taking that necessary step of notifying the prosecuting the attorney, he files his notice of appeal in the Court of Appeals and one in the Supreme Court of Ohio and tries to do it on a pauperis affidavit and they send back and say it takes $20 to get here in this Court on that kind of a motion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1883.992" offset="7639333">Justice Frankfurter I would like to say that your position here, that this is a letter from a clerk and not a judgment is the correct position that this man should go back and do something else and get a judgment first and when I first came into Burns' case in this appeal I had a very similar thought, however, I think we have to concede this fact that this letter from the clerk is in reality and in effect the judgment of the Court.</text>
