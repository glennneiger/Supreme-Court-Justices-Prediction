            <text syncTime="15.121" offset="163819">If the Court pleases, at the close of the day yesterday, I think the Court was giving some attention to the argument which the Government has suggested that our case is premature under Section 2255 and late, under Rule 35 of the Criminal Rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.958" offset="243231">We did not argue this in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.249" offset="256397">We were not at -- in the preparation of that brief, aware of the tenacity of the Government on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.096" offset="287744">We thought, and I think with good reason, that that matter was sufficiently at rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.606" offset="313762">We drew some comfort from the fact that the argument was made at length in opposition to the petition for certiorari, which was granted over that opposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.833" offset="354722">We realized that Gore against the United States had proceeded as a case under 2255 and had been entertained although custody under successive sentences there was precisely involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.292" offset="420551">And finally, we relied on what the statute itself says that it may be -- that relief under it may be sought at anytime.</text>

            <text syncTime="100.593" offset="505710">2255, yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.368" offset="512815">And I think there's one Court of Appeals, I believe, it's the District Court of -- the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia in -- in the Holloway case, I think, which doesn't involve the problem we have here but saw fit to comment that under Rule 35 of the Criminal Rules and under 2255, the party concerned was entitled to seek relief at any time, and that that's what Congress meant when it used those words anytime.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.012" offset="623470">Now, I think we have trouble with Rule 35 if this is precisely -- if this is only a proceeding in the original criminal case, then we are probably caught by the Rule 22, as I recall, of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.434" offset="685119">However, I don't think that Rule 35 of the Criminal Rules, although it appears in that section of -- of the rule, should be dealt with as only a -- a provision for further proceedings in the original criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.320" offset="752619">I -- I think there's a good reason and some authority to say that that rule, just like 2255, invites a collateral inquiry into a criminal judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.094" offset="795773">And collateral inquiry into a criminal judgment traditionally by habeas corpus has always been considered in the nature of -- of a civil proceeding, not a criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.250" offset="844361">And so, I think we're -- we're -- actually we are here in a something like a civil proceeding and therefore, we should not be caught by Rule 22 of this Court, if that is the Government's contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.970" offset="895248">And I think certainly, that we are not premature under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.884" offset="914892">I think it's the most harsh suggestion on the part of the Government that this statute that obviously was designed to create benefits and to make it easier and more simple for people under sentence to obtain relief against illegal and incorrect and invalid sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.665" offset="990020">It's the most harsh thing for the Government to say that before you get that benefit, you've got to serve part of the illegal sentence that this statute was designed to relieve against.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.174" offset="1032025">So as I say, we --</text>

            <text syncTime="407.992" offset="1735346">The -- there is another matter suggested, I think, yesterday by counsel for the Government relative to this statute which he has finally found.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.539" offset="1789576">That was 18 U.S.C. 101 at 35 Stat. which he -- he suggests then some support to his contention that Congress can, when it sees fit, use very definitive language about who is a receiver and who is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.221" offset="1860211">With all due respect to my colleague here, I -- I think that this is almost a reminder of the devil quoting scripture.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.183" offset="1912142">They finally have found a -- a statute which was obscure up -- in this case up until just now, which they suggest may lend some help to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.832" offset="1962715">Actually, however, I -- I heard they ran that statute down.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.495" offset="1981315">And I think it's interesting to know that -- that the 1946 edition of the Code was amended in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.740" offset="2018304">And that Section, which was 101, became 18 U.S.C. 641.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.610" offset="2045785">And in 18 U.S.C. 641 in 1948, the draftsmen dropped out this little phrase about which has theretofore been stolen by any other person.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.099" offset="2095731">And they did something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.635" offset="2105866">They -- they combined in 1948, they combined prior sections of the Code which had dealt with the principal robbers or thieves who dealt with government property.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.730" offset="2170337">So that after 1948, the Code, in one Section, deals with the receipt of stolen property and also, the stealing of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.164" offset="2215999">And it only uses the phrase "receiver of stolen property".</text>
            <text syncTime="531.974" offset="2231254">It doesn't say a receiver of stolen property stolen by another person.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.380" offset="2256854">Now, no one paid much attention, apparently, to the dropping out of that phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.849" offset="2278797">And I'm sure that prosecutions have -- have continued on to the amended section just as they did under the old Section 101, which -- to which reference was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.401" offset="2324982">But it does indicate to me something, I think, that is helpful in trying to find out if we can what Congress was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.802" offset="2354552">In that in 1948, the Code was further amended to provide a separate section which is under the heading of "Arraignment, Pleas and Trial" that reads, “Receiver of stolen property triable before or after principal”.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.183" offset="2444100">Now, that is now 18 U.S.C. 3435 and it reads, “A person charged with receiving or concealing stolen property may be tried either before or after the trial of the principal offender.”</text>
            <text syncTime="600.125" offset="2503868">Now, the interesting thing about that is that there was a provision like that in old 101 which would have been limited to the receiver that dealt with.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.943" offset="2547127">But now, we have a general statute under Federal Criminal Procedure, Arraignment, Pleas and Trial that indicates that at least procedurally, Congress knows how to deal separately with the receiver and with the principal offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.167" offset="2604074">And that Congress all along has meant to do so, I think, is the only logical deduction you can make from the history of that little statute which they found and -- and cited to the Court yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.255" offset="2652348">One other matter that was somewhat newly stressed in argument is the reference to the decisions in the lower federal court under the Dyer Act and under the Stolen Property Act prior, as I recall, to 1940, I think, was the date the Government was considering.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.615" offset="2753808">I didn't -- I was unable to run all of those down but I did take another look at the two that are cited in the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.473" offset="2781288">One of them is Johnson against Zerbst in the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.948" offset="2799156">And what that case held sometime ago was that an individual may be convicted and sentenced under two counts, one, for transporting a stolen automobile and two, for receiving and concealing that same automobile as part of a single transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.483" offset="2889331">So that, actually, if I understand the Government's position now that is authority for a type of situation to which they would not even apply the statute in its present form.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.008" offset="2935411">In other words, that Court said that although you have a -- a transporting of a car and the receipt of a car simultaneously in one transaction, that Court, the Tenth Circuit thought consecutive sentences could be imposed under that -- under the Dyer Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.462" offset="3021197">I don't think that's very helpful in -- in trying to ascribe a purpose to Congress to read an undisclosed knowledge of the Attorney General that at the time of the passage of the 1940 amendment, section (c) in the statue now with which we are concerned, there had been some consideration of the problem by lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.013" offset="3111476">Neither do I think we are aided very much by the other case cited in the Government's brief which is a Sixth Circuit case.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.808" offset="3142614">New York against the United States in 199 Federal because there, a man tried somewhat, it seems to me, as the petitioner here was tired, was found to have been denied the type of complete trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.837" offset="3210742">The Court of Appeals thought he was entitled to and his conviction was reversed, a conviction based primarily on the testimony of an accomplice and -- and in which the Court of Appeals found the District Court had injected himself a little bit too much into the trial of the case in order to let the conviction stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.710" offset="3294229">And the conviction was reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.589" offset="3301752">And then by way of advice, the Court of Appeals in its opinion at page 780 said, "We note by word of caution our disagreement with the Court and counsel that a verdict of guilty on one of the two counts is inconsistent with a similar verdict on the other."</text>
            <text syncTime="818.749" offset="3378343">In other words, there was some confusion even in that case between the District Court and the Court of Appeals as to whether or not you could convict a man for both -- and sentence a man for both transporting and receiving an automobile that had been stolen, transporting in interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="1311.908" offset="5351006">And then, on this appeal, on our motion presently before the Court, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal repeated again what it had decided on the first appeal, its opinion that receiving stolen money and conspiracy are offenses separate from bank robber.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.334" offset="5428746">And the only proof that ties this petitioner to that stolen money was, as we've outlined previously, namely, the he is charged with being in the bank and was shortly thereafter receiving his share of the loot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.352" offset="5488828">There isn't a word of evidence in this record after that, that he ever had anything whatsoever to do with the money, that he disposed of it, sold it or concealed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.312" offset="5532609">And I think it's an unwarranted position of the Government to say that the mere fact that there is an isolated statement in the record that the money had not been recovered, creates some kind of presumption that this man, thereafter, had committed culpable acts.</text>
