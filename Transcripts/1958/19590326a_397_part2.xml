          <turn speaker="richard_n_clattenburg" startTime="0.000" stopTime="422.079">
            <label>Mr. Richard N. Clattenburg</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Prior to the lunch and recess I pointed out that after the Adjustment Board handed down awards in these other cases, the railroad again moved that the suit be dismissed in the District Court for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.062" offset="167581">This motion was granted by the District Court, which entered an order dismissing the suit on the basis -- on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.046" offset="203525">On review, the Court of Appeals below vacated this order and remanded case for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.972" offset="231215">This is the decision from which the writ was requested by petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.041" offset="259532">The court held that the Railway Labor Act did not deprive the District Court of jurisdiction over the claim for wages under the provisions of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.343" offset="296730">Now in order to clarify the issues here, I should like to point out at this time that the District Court in its opinion with the order dismissing the case held that these awards which the board had handed down in other disputes were binding on the plaintiff Mr. DePriest and his successor.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.832" offset="386696">And the Court of Appeals in its opinion, reversing the District Court, held that they were not binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.735" offset="418356">However, that question has not been raised before this Court that is not involved in the petition, the question of the effect of these other awards on the claims presented by respondent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.417" offset="469034">The Court of Appeals' decision is based primarily on this Court's decision in Moore versus Illinois Central in 312 United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.942" offset="503097">There this Court held that a railroad employee who is discharged by his employer was not required to exhaust his remedies under the Railway Labor Act, but could bring a suit in court for damages for the wrongful discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.036" offset="563493">The court below, in this proceeding, said they could find no reason to distinguish between the wage claims, these claims for extra days pay presented by Mr. DePriest in a suit in -- for damages for wrongful discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.184" offset="628067">The petitioner respectfully submits that the decision of the court below was in error and that the District Court, under the Railway Labor Act, in view of the exclusive jurisdiction of the Adjustment Board over claims of this type, did not have and does not have jurisdiction to decide these pay claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.626" offset="721899">The Moore case on which the court below rested its opinion is the earliest case to come before this Court with regard to the jurisdiction of the Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.464" offset="761187">Moore, upon discharge, brought his suit for damages against the railroad, and when the case came to this Court, Mr. Justice Black, in his opinion, stated there was nothing in the act purporting to take away from the courts the jurisdiction to determine a controversy of a wrongful discharge or to make an administrative finding a prerequisite to filing a suit in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.151" offset="848018">There was language in his opinion which at that time was believed to indicate that both the railroads and their employees could -- were free to go either to court or to the Adjustment Board with any type of grievance or claim or dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.234" offset="916355">However, subsequent cases in this Court have limited the jury -- the jurisdiction of the courts and these disputes arising out of the interpretation and application of collective agreements in the railroad industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.786" offset="974555">In 1946, in Order of Railway Conductors against Pitney this Court held that a District Court which was administrating a railroad then in bankruptcy should exercise its equitable discretion, permit a dispute over the manning of trains between conductors and trainmen, the organizations to be preliminarily decided at least by the National Railroad Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.520" offset="1073403">This Court pointed out that Congress had created in the Adjustment Board an agency especially competent and specifically designated to deal with the intricate and technical and factual questions involved in the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.322" offset="1128678">And again in 1950, this Court held in the Slocum case, Slocum versus Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western and in the Order of Railway Conductors case, both in 399 US, that the jurisdiction of a National Railroad Adjustment Board over this type of dispute arising under the railroad collective bargaining agreements is exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.729" offset="1210284">The Slocum case involved a dispute on the Delaware, Lackawanna between the telegraphers and the clerks over the filling of certain jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.188" offset="1240168">The railroad went to the State Court of New York for declaratory judgment as to which -- as to which group of employees should be used for these particular jobs and the court granted that declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.658" offset="1305997">When the case was brought here, the decision of the State Court was reversed and in his opinion Mr. Justice Black said, this case -- in this case the dispute concerned interpretation of an existing bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.928" offset="1367124">A settlement would have prospective as well as retrospective accordance to both the railroad and its employees, since the interpretation accepted would govern the future relations of those parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.831" offset="1406725">This type of agreements has long been considered a potent cause friction leading to strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.415" offset="1428982">The act does represents considered effort on the part of the Congress to provide effective and desirable administrative remedies for the adjustment of railroad employee disputes growing out of the interpretation of existing agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.982" offset="1479346">The Adjustment Board is well equipped to exercise its congressionally imposed functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.418" offset="1497004">Its members understand railroad problems and speak the railroad jargon.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.156" offset="1516022">Long and varied experiences have added to the board's initial qualifications and it went on to talk about desirability of the precedence and uniform interpretation of railroad labor contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.323" offset="1564714">The Companion case the same day, reached the same conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.320" offset="1580701">These were claims involved in the Order of Railway Conductors case claims for extra pay by conductors, similar to the claims that Mr. DePriest presented to petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.076" offset="1627721">And the court held that over these claims the Adjustment Board had exclusive jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.652" offset="1649977">And then a separate opinion in that case, Mr. Justice Black stated that the case sharply points up the conflicts that could arise from State Court intervention in these disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.242" offset="1700342">In that particular case as the opinion pointed out after the suit was brought, the union representing these conductors took the case to the Adjustment Board, but despite that fact the court I believe the South Carolina court proceeded to grant declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.475" offset="1789262">And that --</text>

            <text syncTime="599.530" offset="2501465">The reason for that is that Congress has intended the settlement of these disputes to be kept in the railroad family in this state within a state, as this Court has characterized the railroad industry and has provided a detailed method with specific remedies for the employees giving them special advantages over the employers and a statutory remedy which removes from the courts the necessity to enter into these technical interpretations of collective agreements.</text>

            <text syncTime="1035.605" offset="4245817">May I suggest this also, this isn't confined to retiring employees, because the basis on which the Court below decided the case was that upon his retirement, Mr. DePriest was no longer an employee within the meaning of the Act, and therefore the Adjustment Board had no jurisdiction apparently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.709" offset="4326170">Although the court doesn't specifically say that the Adjustment Board has no jurisdiction nor that there is a concurrent jurisdiction, but it closed the definition of employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.819" offset="4362637">It relies on the fact that in the Moore case, Moore quit his employment, gave up his right to employment and apparently his position is that anyone who ceases to be railroad employee, if he has a wage claim of some kind against the railroad under one of these agreements can then sue in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.455" offset="4425226">So not only we do have retired employees, we have all those who work for a month for the railroad and quit and anyone else who has been in railroad employment and then says well I've given it up, it may even apply to people that (Inaudible) forced reduction, then wouldn't say well I'll quit, but go to court and collect these claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.958" offset="4499205">See that was -- there is a further source here of difficulty for the railroads and the unions and the Adjustment Board, because inevitably if a contract is construed by the Adjustment Board as providing one thing, which would deny the claim from employees, but some court or jury and some state court possibly holds contrary wise with regard to retire to other employee, you then have the fact that that is undoubtedly going to be pressure on the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.292" offset="4624488">There's going to be dissatisfaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.652" offset="4630026">Now employees will say, well now he can quit his job and collect this money, but the union can't collect it from me, and I can't go to the Adjustment Board and get it because they rule out these claims, and there will be pressure, difficulty; perhaps even demands from the unions that the agreement be changed, which would be probably the most logical thing which in turn could result in eventual disruption of interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="1345.651" offset="5486007">Now in your wrongful discharge case and I am speaking practically from the standpoint normally it's a question of procedure in connection with the discipline or whether the discipline justified discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.788" offset="5538565">That isn't the type of dispute which a man retiring leaves with other, with other employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.430" offset="5577122">A man who is discharged, he doesn't leave behind him on the railroad property a lot of people with the same claims, the same -- there isn't likely to be the conflict in decision there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.595" offset="5617768">Each wrongful discharge case in effect is a different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.905" offset="5631039">Now there is a possibility Mr. Justice Black that a court may say such and such a rule is followed by the railroad in conducting this one proceeding is unfair or it was improperly applied, but that is not the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.246" offset="5696345">The court -- the railroad normally in a case like that will correct any procedure it has, would follow the court action in order to avoid possible future damage suits for wrongful discharge but it does affect the relations of the employees in the same way that a claim under the agreement involving seniority or severance pay or something of that sort would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.248" offset="5780355">Here Mr. DePriest when he retired, left numerous similar claims pending on the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.824" offset="5806686">If he has, if he has or is -- the opportunity to go to court, he is required to go to court, there is the clear chance that other people who are in the identical situation with claims arising for identical work will have their claims denied and this dissatisfaction will be created by a contrary interpretation by some judge or jury with regard to the identical claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="1470.033" offset="5983483">In view of the importance of this, I feel that Congress intended that the Railway Labor act should take hold at the time the claim arose, not at the time maybe 5, 10, 15 years later when he might retire, then relinquish it and permit him to go to court to sue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1558.090" offset="6335718">For example you have an agreement providing severance pay or separation allowances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1568.729" offset="6378245">If you have an agreement of that kind providing say, x number of days' pay at the employees last regular rate for each year of service that he has performed for the railroad, if there is any dispute about the application of those things, it will never arise when the man's employment has been terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.661" offset="6450030">And all of those questions and they are not as simple as they sound even from the language I have given you, but inevitably would be before the courts rather than for the Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.601" offset="6489736">In other words, it amazes me in fact that this case has not come before this Court before since the -- since the act has been in existence for 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.972" offset="6539264">As the records shows the Adjustment Board has handled these claims of retired employees, claims by states of the deceased employees and so far as I know it has the full remedy to provide the, in those cases what is required.</text>

            <text syncTime="2729.529" offset="11021458">I'd like to at the outset put this case somewhat better in the time setting that I think Your Honors should have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.870" offset="11066807">The pleadings indicate that Mr. DePriest became an employee of the Pennsylvania Railroad in the year 1915.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.348" offset="11112782">I point out to Your Honors that that of course antedated the Railway Labor Act of 1934 and also the act, the original act of 1926 and that at the time he became an employee and at least thereafter until 1926 if he had any dispute with his employer concerning his right to be paid wages or the construction of his contract of employment, he had one place to go and get his remedy, and that was through a court of common law jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.276" offset="11280488">In 1926 of course the Railway Labor Act was enacted and we have now to consider the amendments of 1934 and the construction that this Court has from time to time placed up on both acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.570" offset="11349661">Now in 1951 Your Honors we submitted three cases to the National Railroad Board of Adjustment which for practical purposes can be said to be companion cases to the DePriest case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.335" offset="11416743">We submitted them there only after we had filed a suit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in which we sought the judgment and we went all the way after we were told by the district judge that he had no jurisdiction except to see to it that we had a forum for – bear in mind these cases were not being prosecuted by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.981" offset="11511306">And that we must go to the National Railroad Board of Adjustment and that they must entertain these complaints or within six months if that was not done the court would reinstate our complaints in the United States District Court in New Jersey and give us a forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.557" offset="11589569">So the three cases, the opinions in which have been called to Your Honors' attention, as appearing in page 9 of the record here, are the opinions in those cases the pleadings in which were filed in 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.391" offset="11664906">And the cases had not been decided when in 1957 this case was being argued on the first appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.747" offset="11726346">Now in the mean time the First Circuit Court of Appeals had decided that Shapiro case and up until that time I had regarded Judge Maden's decision in 1951 as representing the law on the subject that there was no jurisdiction in a court to entertain a railroad wage claim, but when in the Shapiro case I found that the First Circuit had decided to the contrary and that included one of the sitting judges, our own Judge Meyers from the Third Circuit I then wondered if I hadn't been originally right in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.790" offset="11910562">So I trust Mr. Justice Frankfurter I get then to an answer to the question you put to my adversary as to whether or not I agree that wage claims generally are cognizable in court or whether they must go to the National Railroad Board of Adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.036" offset="11983496">There has been a change in my thinking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.757" offset="11990392">As of now and since the decision in the Shapiro case, I am of the opinion that a common law court has jurisdiction over wage claims of railroad workers for otherwise Your Honors what happens to this right that they have and that a claim for wages is a common law claim cognizable in a common law court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.965" offset="12087254">Law been known as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.379" offset="12096867">What do you do, with the right of the employee that he has under the Seventh Amendment to a trial by jury in a court, and in a Federal Court if he can establish diversity of citizenship, wherein has he given that away?</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.875" offset="12166875">Wherein has it been taken away from him by a competent authority?</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.329" offset="12184639">And in this case, may I ask, you have an employee whose right of trial by jury is involved, whose contract of employment antedated all of the legislation on the basis of which it could be said, that his right of trial by jury has been taken away and a remedy substituted by his having the National Railroad Board of Adjustment to take the jurisdiction of his case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3416.213" offset="13768182">May I point that the national policy as expressed in Railway Labor Act of keeping these men at work, keeping them at their posts and keeping the railroads operating, important as it is, is only relevant to their right to able to see to it that they have an expeditious remedy for getting their just compensation and to the extent that that's denied to them or that they are delayed in the realization of it, in the event of a dispute, the same national policy is jeopardized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.110" offset="13895764">Well now Your Honors, we felt and still feel that this suite fits within all of the law that has been declared by this Court in the construction of the Federal Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.174" offset="13956054">We're mindful of the rules that Your Honors declared in Order of Railway Conductors against Pitney, in Order of Railway Conductors against The Southern Railway, and in Slocum against the L &amp; W, but we say that over here on the other side is, the Moore case is still good law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.251" offset="14040377">In addition to what Mr. Justice Black said about it when it was decided by the Court, he commented on it in the decision of the Slocum case, pointed out that there was a distinction, that the Moore was not being overruled and pointed out a fact that my adversaries have at least not to mentioned at all during the litigation, that there was a reason for the distinction between the two lines of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.157" offset="14151973">The reason being that when Moore was discharged, he ceased to be an employee, and that he therefore had the right to make an election as to whether he would go to the board and seek reinstatement or avail himself of his remedies in the Common Law Court, as for a breach of his contract of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.004" offset="14247372">Now if that reason is good, and we think it is because the definition of the word employee certainly does not fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.385" offset="14292929">It does not fit the pre- status after he retired and it certainly doesn't fit now the present plaintiff who is trying to settle his estate and incidentally the diversity of citizenship has been perfectly preserved even by Mr. Day's appointment as administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.835" offset="14370670">So that neither DePriest as retired employee nor Day as his administrator fits within this definition of an employee that the statute lays down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.933" offset="14427094">The decision in the Slocum case in which the distinction was made by Mr. Justice Black was in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.262" offset="14476413">There had been nine years under -- of that rule's prevailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.388" offset="14496893">So as far as I know there has been no effort, at least Congress has not adopted any amendment to that to make it conform to what my adversaries would have you believe was the intent of Congress if the congressional intent different from that as defined by this Court in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.118" offset="14575888">Now they say well, we recognize that that there ought to be a right on the part of the discharged man to continue to sue at law but we think you ought to limit to him alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.229" offset="14632312">Well if that's true then I think they have a difficulty in explaining how they can fit or as Mr. Justice Douglas put it, how they can squeeze the concept of Mr. DePriest's position into the definition of an employee because the definition of a employee does not say that the board has -- or rather the section 153 (i) does not say that the board has jurisdiction over disputes which arose when the relationship of a employer and employee existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.167" offset="14796048">It says that the board has jurisdiction over disputes between an employee or group of employees and a carrier employer, so that it seems to us that the notion of a discharged employee being able to go to a common law court is almost inseparable from the idea that a pensioned employee or his administrator should have the same right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.597" offset="14913808">Now the cases which I found in our state at least point out that in the case of an action for an alleged wrongful discharge, one of the measure -- one of the issues is what wages were owing to this employee at the time of his discharge, what -- is he entitled to collect through us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.186" offset="15016103">So that's embodied in the remedy that clearly the man now has under the early case involves the same issue that we are asking to be tried – it's triable or may be triable in the common law of courts also.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.933" offset="15103143">I point out to Your Honors also that the, the fact that the Moore case was decided a long time ago even though the last mention was discussed in 1950 in the Slocum case, but in 1953 again this Court reiterated that rule in the Koppal against the Transcontinental &amp; Western Airline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.277" offset="15232502">And the only difference between the two cases was that in the latter case this Court found that it was necessary in a reverse to the action for a plaintiff to be able to show that he has complied with state law and exhausted his administrative remedies if the law of the particular state required that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.837" offset="15318706">But otherwise the rule in the Moore case was reiterated and adhered to and the language I think of Mr. Justice Black in the Slocum case was re-quoted exactly.</text>

            <text syncTime="5510.086" offset="22143666">In the first place I meant to point out earlier in my argument and fail to that saying that when a man retires or otherwise leaves service he can't go to the Adjustment Board, also works a hardship on the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5525.832" offset="22206673">There are special advantages to the employees in the Adjustment Board procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5530.326" offset="22224645">As pointed out by Mr. Rutledge in Barber case, which would not be available in court, the Railway Labor Act, in Section 3 first he provides that an employee -- an enforcement proceeding does not have to pay any cost, it is paid by the United States Government such as Court of Appeal, likewise he is entitled to attorneys fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="5551.790" offset="22310536">And the further thing that I would like to point out in closing, that it seems to me that if this Court holds, that retired employees, discharged employees and others who have left the service for one reason or other can take this type of claim to the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="5567.810" offset="22374588">The railroads also should have the right to ask for declaratory judgment for the same type of disputes, in claims brought by those people.</text>
            <text syncTime="5576.333" offset="22408756">That would mean and I am sure this would be opposed by every railroad labor union in the country, because in that way the railroads would circumvent the Southern Railroad case, the Order of Railway Conductors against Southern Railway, which said that you could not go get a declaratory judgment with regard to an agreement which would affect the future relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5594.863" offset="22482840">You would have a court decision perhaps involving only retired employees or those who had quit, which would permit the -- perhaps a Court of Appeals decision on the interpretation of an agreement, which was certainly over the objection of the unions to be committed to stand rather than independent determinations for the Adjustment Board.</text>
