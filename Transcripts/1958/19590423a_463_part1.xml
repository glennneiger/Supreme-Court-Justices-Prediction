            <text syncTime="15.595" offset="165804">This matter is before this Court for the second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.705" offset="182209">In June of 1957, this Court vacated the conviction in this matter and remanded it to the Ohio Supreme Court for reconsideration in the light of the Watkins and Sweezy decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.546" offset="245530">The Ohio Supreme Court did reconsider and adhered to its original decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.362" offset="280848">The first remark I want to make to this Court is that this is the first case in which the Ohio Supreme Court has ruled on the validity and scope of the Ohio Immunity Act relative to testimony before a legislative Committee although there has been an Immunity Act in Ohio since approximately 1872.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.595" offset="385755">I want to also point out to this Court, that this is the first case involving contempt of a state legislative Committee in which an immunity statute has been involved that this Court has considered all other cases that this Court has considered involving immunity statute has involved grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.831" offset="478647">And we all know the grand jury sessions are held in secret so that the testimony given there is not available to the public or to any other persons or agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.778" offset="538520">You must remember that this year was 1952, this was the year that Mrs.Morgan was called before this Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.657" offset="574046">She was the second unwilling witness called before the Commission in the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.958" offset="611244">The first and -- and I want to point out to this Court that she appeared without counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.413" offset="637053">Mrs. Morgan was not represented before this Commission with counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.839" offset="654712">Mrs. Morgan was present during the testimony of the first witness, Mr. (Inaudible), who also appeared without counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.204" offset="688149">This is set forth as a matter of record in the record at page 62, the fact that she was present during the testimony in the questioning of Mr. Terrell (ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="157.206" offset="732244">At the conclusion of Mr. Terrell (ph) testimony in questioning, Mr. Renner, counsel for the Commission, made this statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.962" offset="779264">At page 11 of -- of our brief, Mr. Renner said, ”Mr. Terrell (ph), you have the right to refuse to answer any question, the answer to which might incriminate -- incriminate you.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.632" offset="833912">Otherwise, you are required under the law to answer the questions that are put to you by this Commission," which is a Commission constituted by the people of Ohio to make a city of Communism and Un-American Activities in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.266" offset="900472">That is also in the record of page 62 as part of the record the statement made by this, Mr. Renner.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.899" offset="930983">The Commission commenced questioning this appellant, Mrs.Morgan, without making any preliminary statements as to the scope of its authority, its -- the pertinencies of questions to be asked are any -- anyway identifying its -- its power.</text>

            <text syncTime="243.809" offset="1078627">The second question after Mrs.Morgan was sworn, she gave her name.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.573" offset="1109661">The second question put to here was, “And where do you reside, Mrs.Morgan?”</text>
            <text syncTime="258.192" offset="1136097">On page 12 of our brief, her answer was, “I regret that I cannot answer your question under the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution because to do so would give your Committee an opportunity to incriminate me.”</text>
            <text syncTime="273.790" offset="1198582">Now, prior to the time that this witness was called, on March the 31st of 952 -- I'm looking at page 10 of my brief, at the second paragraph, stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.593" offset="1261693">There were hearing held by this Commission by the way, a secrete session that were not open to the public and which cooperating witnesses testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.556" offset="1293563">April the 1st, 1952 was the first public hearing, where -- where these -- where Mrs.Morgan appeared as an uncooperating witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.348" offset="1332746">The records will show that on March the 31st of 1952, when the hearings were held in Columbus, a person by the name of John DeLong testified at length.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.076" offset="1387708">He described his relationship with the appellant, Anna Morgan, told where she lived, stated that she was a member of the Communist Party and active in its organizational work.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.977" offset="1427310">This had been carried in the news.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.232" offset="1432325">This is also in the record at pages 1662.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.053" offset="1451551">This testimony of the DeLong had been in the newspapers and Mrs.Morgan was aware of the fact that she -- that he had testified about her, her activities and her address.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.780" offset="1502542">Oh, I am corrected by counsel by saying that Mr. DeLong testified at a open hearing, it was not a closed hearing so that is why she was aware of everything that he had to say.</text>

            <text syncTime="397.206" offset="1692191">At the beginning of this session of Mrs.Morgan's, she presented a prepared statement to the Commission in which she stated the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.351" offset="1736808">At page 57 in the record, Mrs. Morgan said this -- about the middle of the page of 57, she said, “This Committee was paid to investigate so-called Un-American and subversive activities, but in all these months, it has fail to state what it considers Un-American or subversive.”</text>
            <text syncTime="437.869" offset="1854882">At the bottom of that page, she goes on and she says, “Who am I, you may ask?”</text>
            <text syncTime="443.835" offset="1878706">She answers with her statement, “I am just an average American house wife.”</text>
            <text syncTime="449.192" offset="1900126">And closes that paragraph by saying, “I now, present my sincere beliefs, and let this Committee and all interested citizens who pay this Committee judge me.”</text>
            <text syncTime="458.286" offset="1936488">Then she proceeds with her statement over to page 59 at this time which I want to read her closing paragraph, “Because this Committee conducts its hearings like an inquisition with no rules of evidence that victims are denied the rights which they would have in a dully constituted Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.054" offset="2023633">Therefore, I must claim the protection of the Fifth Amendment of the constitution of the United States and remain silent before this Committee.”</text>

            <text syncTime="517.905" offset="2175039">He said, “Mrs. Morgan, I should like to advice you under the Fifth Amendment, you are permitted to refuse to answer questions that might tend to incriminate you.”</text>

            <label>Ms. Ann Fagan Ginger</label>
            <text syncTime="880.095" offset="3623790">This Court held in the Sweezy case that the responsibility for the proper conduct of a less -- legislative investigating committee rest on the legislature itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.867" offset="3658794">And if the lack of any indications that the legislative -- legislature wanted the information which the investigating body attempted to elicit must be treated as the absence of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.588" offset="3697768">Now, here, we have a stronger case.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.285" offset="3704560">This Commission was established in June of 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.125" offset="3719920">It called what are known as friendly witnesses until the spring of 1952, and in April 1st, it called Mr. Terrell (ph) and immediately thereafter, called the appellant as a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.234" offset="3760358">These were the first witnesses who declined to answer any questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.043" offset="3775509">A few months later, it called -- I believe it was a few months later, it called the witnesses who were involved in the last case.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.917" offset="3799019">January 1st, 1953, that is nine months after it began asking questions of unfriendly witnesses, the Commission itself recommended its own demise and provided that there should not be a period in which Ohio could not investigate Un-American Activities and therefore proposed a new statue setting up a special Assistant Attorney General who would work on this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.671" offset="3886059">And since they've realized that it would take a few months for this legislation to be passed, they recommended that their life be continued for six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.625" offset="3913853">In other words, here, we have a situation in which the Chairman of the Commission did not push the witnesses to answer questions which they felt might be incriminating, in which the Chairman and other members of the Commission did not direct witnesses to answer their questions in which the Commission itself evidently felt that it should not continue to exist because it not -- did not serve a legislative function and in which the General Assembly abolished the Commission and instead, set up a procedure providing secret hearings for witnesses in this kind of case before a grand jury and it evidently accepted this Court's decision in the Nelson case that this whole area has been preemptd by Congress because it has proceeded in no way since that decision, even under the special Assistant Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.578" offset="4101726">So here, unlike Sweezy, we have a clear indication that there was an absence of authority in the Commission to attempt to elicit this type of information from the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.505" offset="4145403">This Court also held in the Sweezy case that the authorizing resolution must be studied in order to discover the amount of discretion conferred upon the investigating Committee and its safeguards can be nullified when the Committee is investing with a broad and ill-defined jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.143" offset="4207992">There is nothing in this resolution establishing the Un-American Activities Commission of Ohio which can be considered narrow in scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.434" offset="4245086">The statute is set forth in the appendix to the brief of appellant, and you can see from the wording that it was written with the same broad sweep as that involved -- involved Watkins and Sweezy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.459" offset="4301197">This Commission was to investigate all facts relating to the activities of person groups, the persons groups and organization whose membership includes persons who have as their objective or maybe suspected of having as their objective the overthrow or reform of our constitutional governments by fraud, force, violence or other unlawful means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.333" offset="4380714">All facts concerning persons, groups and organizations known to be or suspected of being dominated by or giving allegiance to a foreign power or whose activities might adversely affect the contribution of this state to the national defense, the safety and security of this State, the functioning of any agency of the State or national government for the industrial potential of this State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.618" offset="4461798">Surely, it would be hard to find a statute written in much broader language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.217" offset="4480188">This appellant as I mentioned, objected to the scope of this inquiry within her ability as a layman and doing it in writing in advance at the hearing by saying that no one could know what Un-American or subversive meant from the work of the Commission up to the point at which she was called as a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.980" offset="4547271">In addition, no statement was made at the opening of the hearing concerning the scope or purpose of the Commission or of that particular hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.142" offset="4579976">And in fact, the questions asked of this witness were not pertinent to any matter properly before a state legislative investigating committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.390" offset="4612890">Some of the questions were purely preliminary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.451" offset="4625220">For example, "Where do you reside?</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.647" offset="4633997">Are you a citizen?</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.982" offset="4639326">How long have you been a resident of Franklin County and where are you employed?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.885" offset="4654895">He sound like purely preliminary questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.466" offset="4669210">As to the question of, "what -- where do you reside?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.514" offset="4689377">My colleague has already pointed out that the previous day, a witness had gone into great length about, where the -- where my client resided and meetings of the Communist Party had been held at her home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.552" offset="4729605">In terms of her employment, many of the questions related to an allegation that she had been employed by the Community Party of Franklin County or the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.300" offset="4764609">As for the other questions, these were purely preliminary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.114" offset="4775790">Well, it maybe true that in a court of law as Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out, a witness cannot merely shout Fifth Amendment and proceed to not answer questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.104" offset="4807764">In a legislative investigating committee which is not a court, these questions cannot, we believe, has been -- the answers could not possibly have been of any help to the Ohio General Assembly in framing legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.367" offset="4860844">And therefore, they were purely preliminary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1351.800" offset="5510562">In the Sweezy case by the Attorney General of New Hampshire, an area in which Government should be extremely reticent to threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.808" offset="5538565">And the Court said, "We do not now conceive of any circumstances wherein a state interest would justify infringement of rights in these fields."</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.410" offset="5573047">But you continued on that point to say that you didn't have to reach this question because the New Hampshire Supreme Court had recognized there was nothing to connect the questioning of the petitioner with the fundamental interest of the State in preventing its course of an overthrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.269" offset="5624456">Now, we maintain the facts here are very similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.990" offset="5639293">The statute itself establishing the Commission required the Commission to invade the appellant's liberty of political expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.862" offset="5670849">It required that questions be asked which could not but affect appellant and other citizens of Ohio in their free exercise of their rights under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.182" offset="5720064">And the questions could not have provided the Commission or the legislature with any new facts relating to possible overthrow of the Government of the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.151" offset="5756008">They rather dealt into appellant's pass conduct in order to corroborate information already in the possession of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.438" offset="5781086">In other words, we maintain that the statute establishing the Commission was unconstitutional as in violation of the First Amendment rights guaranteed to this witness through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.805" offset="5834585">Now, we come to the problem which the Ohio Supreme Court faced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.968" offset="5863215">They were not willing to discuss the question of the First Amendment rights either before Watkins and Sweezy were handed down or thereafter, nor would they prepare to discuss the points that this Court had made on the responsibility of the legislature over investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.223" offset="5936253">No opinion was written after the argue -- reargument on remand from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.744" offset="5954330">Nor is the Court willing to discuss the problem of the broadly worded statute and that there was no method for determining the pertinency of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.117" offset="5983796">None of these things where ever discussed by the Ohio Supreme Court in any written opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.165" offset="6008038">They merely affirmed the conviction without opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.105" offset="6027786">They therefore rested their whole opinion upon the fact that there is an Immunity Act in the State of Ohio and that the statute does not require a direction to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.994" offset="6067388">And that therefore, they were not found by this Court's decision in Emspak, Bart and Quinn which said that in a federal case, there must be a direction to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.915" offset="6111065">I think it is significant that this is the first case in which a State seeks to have this Court affirm a conviction for contempt in the absence of any direction to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.473" offset="6149308">In the Regan case for example, there was a direction to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.748" offset="6174386">The United States statute in the Emspak, Bart and Quinn case says nothing about a direction to answer no more than does the statute in the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.842" offset="6214719">But this Court felt that there must be a clear disposition of the witness' objection as a prerequisite to prosecution for contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.613" offset="6249827">While it is true that the State of Ohio is governed by the Supreme Court of the State of Ohio in the interpretation of its statutes and we cannot claim that there is a violation of due process within the meaning of the Ohio Supreme Court or the Ohio constitution by fair which direct to answers since the Ohio Supreme Court says this is not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.701" offset="6330180">We do claim that there is a denial of the right of the appellant under the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause when you say to her in effect after the fact, "You should have answered because you would -- were clothed with immunity from the time you walk into the hearing room.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.877" offset="6394859">She had a right to a clear-cut choice between refusing to answer on the basis of the privilege against self-incrimination and answering and being clothed with immunity from prosecution by the State only in an area where prosecution by the Federal Government was not only possible but probable in that time at the period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.597" offset="6493811">The Court held -- this Court held in Emspak, Bart and Quinn that their giving a direction to answer is a minimal procedural requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.649" offset="6529964">And that failure to do so is the defect in laying the foundation for a prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.891" offset="6546892">We feel that the same situation applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.288" offset="6568521">It cannot be assumed that the witness would have given the same answer if she had been given a clear-cut choice, it's impossible to know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.481" offset="6601331">The fact that she wrote statement and handed it to the Commission at the beginning of the hearing, does not mean that if, the Chairman of the Commission had said, “Now, you must understand, Mrs. Morgan, that if you do not answer these questions, you will be cited for a contempt and you must understand it if you do answer them, you cannot be prosecuted by the State of Ohio because we're granting you with immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1648.396" offset="6696939">Well, I'm suggesting that there is no reason to believe that she wouldn't have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.239" offset="6712299">And I think the fact that she stuck so closely to this formula of words in answering each question, indicates that she was without counsel that she had thought the thing out in advance and that she was not capable, she didn't feel that she would be capable of finding a new formulation during the course of the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.250" offset="6784397">I don't think it, that here rigidity in answering indicates a rigidity in her ability to reason but rather a fear of this hearing and of her, the fact she wasn't a lawyer and that she was dealing with lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.287" offset="6848554">Certainly, it is impossible to know what the witness would have done if she had directed to answer since she wasn't directed to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.032" offset="6875512">And it can't be said that it wasn't until after the 12th question that in the indictment -- that the Chairman told here she could use the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.954" offset="6907173">She have sat in a hearing room while Mr. Terrell (ph) was interrogated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.150" offset="6923995">And Mr. Terrell (ph) had been told by the Chairman that he did not have to answer the question if it might incriminate him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.904" offset="6950954">And certainly, she listened to this I'm sure with considerable interest and was affected by this from the first question forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.969" offset="6987212">It cannot be held either that the Immunity Act in Ohio is sufficient to erase the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.382" offset="7016887">There can be no contention that a -- an immunity granted by the State of Ohio even if it did clothe her with a complete immunity from prosecution in the State of Ohio from the moment she walk into the room.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.953" offset="7063176">And even it is assumed that this immunity took effect without anything being said about its existence and without any mention being made to her that it was being granted to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.255" offset="7108420">It cannot be claimed if immunity erased the privilege within the language of this Court in the Olman case because we have in this country two sovereignties that act upon each individual at any given moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.892" offset="7170905">And in this case, the United States had taken an active interest in the prosecution of the person's forced subversive activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.189" offset="7212178">You can't claim that a -- an immunity granted by the State of Ohio would have had any effect whatever in a prosecution against this witness under federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.328" offset="7256691">And therefore, it is untrue to suggest that the Immunity Act had been applied at all to her, erased here privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.228" offset="7296293">Now, this Court has never heard a case in which the double -- double sovereignty question arose in terms of immunity where there was a legislative investigating committee involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.040" offset="7331506">All of the cases before this Court, I think, from Brown against Walker, to whole list, involved grand jury proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.263" offset="7360449">And there's a fundamental difference between a grand jury and a legislative investigating committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.401" offset="7380929">In a grand jury, the proceedings are secret and there would be no way for a prosecutor in another jurisdiction to know what is said in the grand jury minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.375" offset="7424920">Unless there is illusion between the state and federal prosecuting attorneys which one would not assume.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.892" offset="7446967">Therefore, the decisions which this Court has handed down, Jack against Kansas, Brown against Walker, United States against Murdock and the others including Knapp against Schweitzer do not settle the matter here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.392" offset="7488972">The fact is that wherever there has been an actual livelihood or probability of prosecution in the second jurisdiction, this Court, as Justice Holmes said one way or the other has not -- has not found the person guilty of contempt for refusal to answer and that was true in Bowman against Bates, it was construing United States against Saline Bank and then other cases in the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.630" offset="7581863">The -- you cannot read the fact in these cases, Jack against Kansas and the others and separate them without separating them from the theory profoundrd because in none of those cases was there the kind of threat of prosecution in the second jurisdiction, which existed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.429" offset="7661066">This was April of 1952, there were Smith Act prosecutions going on throughout the United States and there were also state prosecutions going on for the same kind of activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.192" offset="7704116">Under State of Ohio had at one time, prosecuted a witness under its State Criminal Syndicalism Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.748" offset="7730343">So that there was such a law on the books and it was known to the prosecutors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.581" offset="7745703">And it cannot be assumed that the witness here before the State Committee was immune from such federal prosecution or that the danger was in any way improbable or they --</text>

            <text syncTime="2124.089" offset="8599698">Well, it may seem simple to settle it on the question of direction to answer and we are not suggesting it shouldn't be settled on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.449" offset="8625194">We've argued the case four, five times before the Ohio Supreme Court and we are not prepared to omit any point since that Court has seemed fit to decide it so many times against us.</text>

            <text syncTime="2161.093" offset="8747760">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.710" offset="8750164">But on the question of double sovereignty, your word is one that we are concerned with along with the other members of the bench because you have written about it so extensively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.411" offset="8793004">And the -- we have several positions on the immunity question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.958" offset="8815156">One is that she was never directed to answer and affords no other rights were at any given a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.048" offset="8831561">One of this is not the same as Knapp against Schweitzer because that was a grand jury where the proceedings were secret and here there was a great likelihood of prosecution by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.985" offset="8871267">We also say that the statute required disclosure and liaison between the State to federal officials as to any matter testified to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.251" offset="8904391">And we also say that fundamentally, the immunity granted by one jurisdiction is not sufficient unless it covers in the tread of prosecutions from the second jurisdiction which also could prosecute for the same crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.826" offset="8982653">The State of Ohio has concerned itself with the question of the -- its sovereignty and seems to be concern that it is in danger of losing its sovereignty if this Court reverses the conviction of appellant on these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.047" offset="9067604">And yet, this is the first time that Ohio has had to consider the legislative Immunity Act for the problem of contempt in the face of this Immunity Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.907" offset="9115042">When Mr. Justice Frankfurter earlier asked what the Immunity Act provided or provide case law at this point, there has never been a prior case in which this issue arose and there has never been a case of contempt of the Ohio legislature or the Ohio legislative investigating committee involved in any field other than corruption in Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.168" offset="9188080">And I think this speaks well for the sovereign State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.801" offset="9198529">But until 1952, they never got into a field of legislative inquiry outside the field of corruption in Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.973" offset="9227264">It is important of course that in Ohio, the investigating committees which have operated have in the past not attempted to question private individuals of particularly about their political beliefs or actually about anythingelse.</text>
