            <text syncTime="3893.158" offset="15675956">Now, I see that in our time, the only place that criminal procedures have been based on such a process have been in the police states of Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia on their satellites never in this country.</text>

            <text syncTime="3929.430" offset="15821093">The fact is that -- that if we look perhaps 20 years, I suggest to the Court, 25 years, when God willing, the Russian people are really free, perhaps aligned with us against Great China as a common foe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3949.098" offset="15899773">Looking back with a benefit of hindsight, what will we see as having been the most important weapon in -- on national defense?</text>
            <text syncTime="3957.792" offset="15934568">I think we will see what the benefit of hindsight, how important it was to keep military preparedness, how important it was to use the F.B.I. and other internal security agents to prevent suppression at home.</text>
            <text syncTime="3972.178" offset="15992038">But I suggest to the Court that it will be found with the benefit of hindsight that the most potent weapon in our arsenal defense turns out to be our way of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3983.757" offset="16038431">Best epitomized perhaps in that simple phrase due process of law and it is that maintenance of that way of life, the maintenance of due process of law held before the other peoples in the world that I suggest to you in an age of intercontinental missiles with hydrogen warheads will turn out to have been a strongest weapon of defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="4087.370" offset="16452838">Mr. Donovan, before you -- before you sit down, on behalf of the Court, I would like to express our appreciation to you for the service that you have rendered to the cause of justice by appearing for this defendant because we understand the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4108.073" offset="16535698">He was unrepresented in the District Court and the District Judge requested the bar associations of Brooklyn and of Queens County to recommend names of lawyers who were capable of and who might be willing to conduct the defense of this man as a public service and not for compensation, that the bar associations did recommend you that the -- that the Court appointed you that you served during this long and arduous trial in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4150.200" offset="16704136">You pursued it in the Court of Appeals and to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4156.755" offset="16730363">I -- I think I can say that in the time I have been on this Court that no man is to undertake him for that reason, for that purpose, a more arduous nor self-sacrificing service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4175.582" offset="16805700">And we feel indebted to you and to your associate, Mr. Debevoise, for -- for having done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4183.171" offset="16836106">It gives us a great feeling of comfort to know that judges, trial judges and members of bar associations and members of our bar are willing to undertake this sort of public service in a type of case which would normally be offensive to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4207.062" offset="16931610">We thank you very much.</text>
