            <text syncTime="10.509" offset="42005">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.929" offset="59664">This is an appeal from the decision of the District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania in dismissing an information.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.204" offset="96758">Since it seems to involve the construction of Section 214 of Title 18, probable jurisdiction was noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.098" offset="132389">Brief of this or the record is of course extremely brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.217" offset="152764">The information is one paragraph long.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.711" offset="170841">It read as follows On or about of the 5th of December 1953, in the City of York, Pennsylvania, in the Middle District of Pennsylvania and in the jurisdiction of the Court, in violation of Section 213, the defendant did knowingly, willfully and unlawfully offered or promised to Congressman Stauffer to donate to the Republican Party the sum of $1000 a year in consideration of the use of influence to procure the Office of Postmaster of York, Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.346" offset="345339">The defendant, through his counsel, this information was filed on July of 1954 and the defendant, through his counsel, immediately filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that this information did not state a cause or crime within Section 214.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.682" offset="410645">The matter was briefed and argued in September of 1954 and then March 17, 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.049" offset="444186">The decision was handed down and the order dismissing the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.803" offset="475115">The court below looked at the information, looked back at the statute and said that the offer of $1000, to donate $1000 to the Republican Party made the Republican Party the offeree, and that the language of Section 214 read, “Whoever…offers or promises money or a thing of value, to any person, firm or corporation in consideration use of influence is guilty of misdemeanor,” pointed out that the Republican Party is not a firm, person or corporation and therefore, not within -- not proscribed by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.576" offset="662256">The Judge went on to point out that Section 215, which he called the counterpart, was originally enacted in 1926 with Section 214, as two sections of one Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.056" offset="720144">And that this other section specifically provides for political contribution says, “Whoever here in the form of political contribution or for personal emolument solicits money or a thing of value shall be guilty of misdemeanor.”</text>
            <text syncTime="200.178" offset="800705">He points that this indicates that it was not intended to proscribe the use of an offer of a political contribution in Section 214.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.573" offset="850233">We think that first, the lower court misconceived the issue but in any event, that the Republican Party is a person within the broad meaning of that term in criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.216" offset="912823">To go to the second point first, and I would rather but the case did not go off on that because it doesn't sit very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.362" offset="945424">It is not an easy feeling but nevertheless, it is a supportable one that the Republican Party is a person within Section 1 of Title 1, which was enacted one year prior to the reenactment of Section 214, includes, except where the context indicates otherwise a -- an association of persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.607" offset="1066423">This matter was recently before this Court in the matter of a partnership as was there it could be an entity that could be prosecuted under criminal statute, which began with the words “Whoever” and it was determined in the A &amp; P Trucking Company case decided last month, that such a broad interpretation, the word “Whoever” came within the criminal proscription of that particular Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.514" offset="1194005">And we believe that a Republican Party is a person within the broad meaning of the word “Person” in Section 1 of Title 1 of the United States Code, but this is a stiff and stilted interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.336" offset="1257326">The indictment or the information says that the offer or promise was to Congressman Stauffer, and we think that the real issue is whether he was offered anything of value.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.139" offset="1324513">And the defendant, the defense counsel on page 14 of this brief says, “This is the basic policy of our brief, at least we agree this is the main point on which the issue should be determined that here is an offer to a party, to support this party if he gets a public office or inconsideration of the Congressman using his efforts to get this man a political appointed office.”</text>
            <text syncTime="368.756" offset="1474978">The first point, first hurl I think, we have to get over is the fact that this is money, a $1000, it is money and we're coming in under the phrase, “Thing of value”.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.926" offset="1539657">The defendant in his brief points out that the money or thing of value is in the disjuncture and that one cannot be the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.066" offset="1584170">Although later in -- on page 14 on the top page 15, in order to limit the broad scope of the word or phrase, “Thing of value,” he says that the words “Money” modify color and give meaning to the phrase, “Thing of value.”</text>

            <text syncTime="423.205" offset="1692735">I think perhaps if we change the illustration just enough that this offer was a $1000 a year to his law partner, we can see that it would not be the equivalent of a $1000 a year at the end but it would be something very definitely a thing of value.</text>
