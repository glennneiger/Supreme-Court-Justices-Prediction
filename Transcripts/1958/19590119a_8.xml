            <text syncTime="1838.135" offset="7455953">Now, there is evidence, Your Honor, that at the state police headquarters, a doctor had looked at these wounds.</text>

            <text syncTime="1857.515" offset="7533484">They said they couldn't do anything about it anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.108" offset="7543829">They said that they never asked for an attorney, but they also said that they wouldn't have gotten one, if he had asked until they got through their questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.013" offset="7579460">Meaning, he'd sign his confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.334" offset="7592730">They said his parents had never been there to see him and that they could have been if they'd come after they got through interrogating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.669" offset="7630033">And after they got through interrogating, the courts as when they signed the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.843" offset="7642781">Now, all that's in the record and is undisputed, and with the picture, the background -- the background of plainclothesman interrogating two men charged for shooting one of their fellow plainclothesman on the Indianapolis police force.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.511" offset="7713416">And with these men in the physical condition they were admittedly in, it does seem to me that you have a background where the Court should look into this thing and weigh some of this evidence as it has done in other cases regardless of what the Court is saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.238" offset="7788335">Now, one of the things here in this case which -- and -- and one of the things which points to the danger of having a trial 18 years afterwards, as this was, all of this is evidence that occurred 18 years after the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.866" offset="7858866">Here were men, 75 years old, retired from the police force, testifying about who was there and what the fellow said and what he didn't say 18 years before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.503" offset="7901393">Now, another thing, both of the defendants in that -- that case charged that the -- that the -- the confession was made the following day rather than the day that the police said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.113" offset="7955832">This is admitted that immediately after the confession was signed, they were taken to the hospital, the city hospital, city police city hospital, they were taken over there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.591" offset="8001703">But when this case came for trial, the record of that hospital showing when they were admitted for that treatment, it would seem to me would be rather conclusive about how long they'd have them under surveillance and how long they'd have them under questioning, but that was not brought out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.036" offset="8067532">I assume it was because the long lapse of time had meant disappearance and destruction of the hospital record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.759" offset="8098356">That's just one of the things, some of the guns were missing, no ballistics was available at all and after 18 years, I don't care what you try to do, you can't have anything that bears semblance to a fair trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2279.937" offset="9223084">It seems to me it would be the duty of the State to come in and say, "Well, even if we were (Inaudible) for all of these 18 years, still he didn't get hurt, that's virtually what was done of the Cook case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.553" offset="9269582">And in the Cook case, if the -- if they had been able to give him a -- an appeal 18 years afterward of his original conviction, and the Supreme Court affirmed it, why he wasn't hurt because they would've affirmed it one year after his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.221" offset="9340217">But when he was granted a new trial that cast a whole new light on it because other men are entitled to new trials within less than 18 years after the crime of which they're charged.</text>

            <text syncTime="2433.750" offset="9838320">I think I should add my tribute to that of the courts to Mr. Isham's appearance here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.105" offset="9863816">I know that during the course of this proceeding he's had a serious personal loss in his family and yet he has continued his perseverance in this cause and I think that the sincerity and principles are beyond question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.481" offset="9929331">I submit, however, that the essence of his dilemma in his action really is that the question before this Court has already been resolved against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.639" offset="9977919">The record conclusively resolves it against him and the fact is that these petitioners were not denied their constitutional rights in the courts of the -- of the State of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.791" offset="10018565">They were not convicted on the basis of coerced confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.770" offset="10034448">The confessions that were admitted at their trial in Hancock County, Indiana were not coerced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.433" offset="10065063">Now, Mr. Isham made most of his argument on other points and for that reason I shall, as soon as I can, devote a good deal of time to those points since I think the Court is interested in -- in them, but I think first of all that we should discuss the question which the Court has before it which is the admissibility of the confessions either written or oral.</text>

            <text syncTime="2519.280" offset="10180524">Now, first of all, there are three points or four points rather that perhaps we didn't bring out this sufficient clarity in our brief in this cause and I'd like to point those out and the first one is important, I think, particularly because the emphasis of Mr. Isham put on the situation which existed in 1935 in Indiana when these two petitioners where apprehended after having been in a shooting scrape with Indianapolis Police Department officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.417" offset="10297031">First of all, the officer who was later dead was not dead at any time during these -- when the statements were taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.947" offset="10331199">Now, that doesn't mean that it wasn't possible for coercion or duress have been used on them because the police officers who were interrogating them were fellow officers of an officer who had been wounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.860" offset="10390862">But I think it's important because there was not a reason for the hysteria that a death of a fellow officer might have generated, at the time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2585.088" offset="10443734">The officer was very much alive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.014" offset="10451466">And in fact on December 13th, as the record shows, he identified these petitioners from his hospial bed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2626.031" offset="10607470">These two individuals escaped from Michigan City Penitentiary together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.542" offset="10621576">They were in the penitentiary on a 10-year sentences for auto banditry and they are approximately had served half of their sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.763" offset="10654386">They were -- they rented an apartment in Indianapolis and on December the 7th, two Indianapolis police officers went to that apartment, knocked on the door and gained entrance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.521" offset="10697435">Now, their dispute is to how they gained entrance, but they did gain entrance and there was a gun battle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.958" offset="10719169">After the gun battle, in which all four participants were wounded, these petitioners made their escape by running out of a backdoor, down a stairway, through an alley and intercepting an automobile being driven by a doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.218" offset="10796283">They relieved the doctor of his automobile and drove with his car which included his medical kit to a town near Rushville, Indiana, approximately 50 miles distant from the City of Indianapolis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.289" offset="10848528">There, they remained from December 7th until early on the morning of December 10th, when a squad of State police officers surrounded the house and succeeded in capturing them without any further bloodshed or gun battles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.759" offset="10902444">They were taken from their place of capture to the Rushville State Police Post.</text>

            <text syncTime="2727.361" offset="11012786">Now, they were taken from the Rushville post to the Indianapolis State Police Headquarters which at that time were located in the basement of the Statehouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.891" offset="11050924">And there, according to the State's version of what happened, they were held without being talked to by any police officers except the captain who was in charge of the state police until they were attended by the state police physician, Dr. Byrd (ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.534" offset="11129501">Now, their version is they weren't, but these -- these two versions are directly contradictory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.023" offset="11155414">Dr. Byrd (ph) treated them an hour according to State's version of the case and was paid by them out of money they had on their person when they were captured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.674" offset="11198046">About 8, 8:30 or 9 o'clock that morning, they were turned over by the Indiana State Police to the Indianapolis Police Departmet and were taken then to Indianapolis Police Headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.250" offset="11248410">Now, here the story is diverged diametrically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.631" offset="11261889">According to the State's version of the events, they talked freely about what happened at all times when they came from the Rushville post to the state police headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.014" offset="11327404">There are statements in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.070" offset="11335659">There is testimony that they admitted the crime at that time.In fact, were boastful about it, proud of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.947" offset="11359169">There are statements between the Indianapolis Police Department Headquarters and the Indianapolis State Police Headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.943" offset="11383097">According to the State's version of the events, within a matter of two hours or less, after their arrival on the morning of December 10th at Indianapolis Police Headquarters, they had signed their confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.173" offset="11436074">They were then and here we agree, immediately taken to the city hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.762" offset="11454464">Now, Mr. Isham raises a question and I think it's a good one as to why weren't the hospital records introduced at this time to show just exactly what the date was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.132" offset="11503888">And I don't think we have to wonder very long about that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.585" offset="11517680">The reason that they weren't introduced is because if they had been introduced, they would not have confirmed the petitioner's story.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.241" offset="11548296">More than that, why wasn't the testimony of say the attending physician at the city hospital introduced by the petitioners who were well aware, in advance, that they would raise this issue at the trial and who did raised it and who would have a hearing outside the presence of a jury on the question of the admissibility of these confessions and introduced only their own statements at that hearing?</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.811" offset="11638575">The reason that they didn't introduce it appears in the testimony of the individual concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.560" offset="11657592">He did testify as a witness at the trial and he did testify as to this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.127" offset="11679848">Now, his testimony appears at page 192 or 193 of the printed record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.171" offset="11708061">And I think it pretty well shows why those records weren't introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.017" offset="11731466">And apparently, although this is only surmised, they were in existence at the time of this trial.</text>
