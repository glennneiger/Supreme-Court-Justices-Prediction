            <text syncTime="9.330" offset="140727">The petitioner, Vincent Joseph Spano, was convicted of a crime of murder in the first degree in the County Court, Bronx County, New York, was sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.630" offset="217840">The sentence has been stayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.274" offset="224423">Certiorari was granted by this Honorable Court on the 15th day of December, 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.877" offset="262875">The Court of Appeals of the State of New York affirmed the judgment of conviction by a vote of 4-to-3.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.659" offset="302059">Now, may it please the Court, briefly the facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.817" offset="330689">On January 22nd, 1957, the petitioner, Vincent Joseph Spano, was in a bar and grill and had a $10-bill on the counter when the deceased, one Frank Palermo walked in and took the bill off the counter and walked out of the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.588" offset="445733">Vincent Joseph Spano walked out after him, an argument started and Frank Palermo, a former professional fighter gave the petitioner Spano a most vicious beating, punching him down to the ground and kicking him in the head, leaving him in a dazed and bloody condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.566" offset="565687">He became violently sick immediately, vomited right in front of him, was taken into the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.981" offset="595257">Someone there washed his bruises.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.805" offset="614588">He went home, walked home, came back and went to the candy store that he was directed to go to by Palermo.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.674" offset="670072">When Palermo gave Spano this beating he said, “This isn't all.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.241" offset="696299">Bring the rest of the money to this candy store,” designating a certain candy store.</text>

            <text syncTime="167.164" offset="772054">We contend, sir, that it was a matter of tribute, was a matter of extortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.565" offset="797654">Palermo directed Spano to go to this designated candy store.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.484" offset="821269">That to anyone in that neighborhood, amongst those people, was known as the headquarters of Palermo and when Spano got in there, as the evidence shows, three gangsters were in the place besides Palermo.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.827" offset="898696">Spano had gone home in his dazed condition, had gotten a gun, had walked to the candy store and at first fired a volley of two shots up near the top of the ceiling, no where's near or in the direction of Palermo.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.895" offset="982915">The evidence shows that at that time, as the petitioner stated the door behind him closed or opened and he felt someone running towards him from behind, the three in the store closing in on him and it was at that time that he fired a volley of three shots and killed Palermo.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.578" offset="1097644">He then, as the evidence showed, left the scene and was missing for a period of about I believe it was 10 days or two weeks, something of that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.652" offset="1149994">It then developed that Spano got in touch with an attorney named Tobias Russo, a well-known lawyer in Bronx and arranged for Mr. Russo to surrender to the authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.183" offset="1216136">In the meantime before the surrender, the District Attorney of Bronx County had presented the evidence that they had before the Grand Jury of Bronx County and obtained an indictment charging this defendant with the crime of murder in the first degree.</text>

            <text syncTime="525.733" offset="2206281">Now, sir, after, 12:30, they saw they couldn't get anywhere, they took the petitioner up to the squad room of a police station and there continued to interrogate him and he there again, asked for his attorney, time and time again.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.831" offset="2266676">At time, one of the police officers testified that he couldn't find the -- a lawyer with the said name or telephone number in the telephone book.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.022" offset="2307427">At any rate, he never got an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.093" offset="2315786">At any rate, during that time, the District Attorney and the police sent a police officer named Bruno, who was a friend of Spano and to Spano a number of times, to tell him that he, Bruno, was in trouble if he didn't make -- if Spano didn't make a statement in this case, that his wife was going to have another child.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.980" offset="2423306">He might lose his job.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.538" offset="2429576">And he insisted that he make a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.705" offset="2438144">The reason for that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.037" offset="2447548">While the defendant or the petitioner was out before he arranged for the surrender, he called his friend Bruno and told him what had happened and said that Palermo had been on his back and had given him a bad beating and that he was dazed and so forth that he killed him and he wanted advice, that he was going to get a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.965" offset="2547231">So now, they use this same friend, Bruno, to coerce Spano into making a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.444" offset="2585161">They used him for the purpose of having him disregard, if they could, the advice and instructions of his attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.861" offset="2618807">The District Attorney all of the time knew that this man was represented by an attorney, knew that there had been an indictment, knew that there was a judicial proceeding pending, yet nevertheless, continued to interrogate and interrogate until sometime around 3:30 a.m., after Bruno had left Spano for a few minutes, Spano said, “All right, let me make a statement.”</text>

            <text syncTime="881.275" offset="3628492">It's a coerced confession in the -- in the sense or in the language of Judge Desmond of the Court of Appeals in the dissenting opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="893.202" offset="3676139">Well, Judge Desmond said this, “Usually, of course, the test for admissibility of a confession is voluntariness and usually voluntariness is a question of fact for the jury.”</text>
            <text syncTime="904.112" offset="3719816">But one of the senses in which the courts used voluntary, a confession or incriminating testimony taken from a defendant without warranting of his rights, during the progress of a criminal cause against them is not voluntary since in such a case the fact is undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.128" offset="3795884">The question is not one for the jury but a constitutional question of due process, an undisputed fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.977" offset="3823261">Some violations of rights, are too fundamental to be excused by a jury or layman, directly and frankly violated here with two such rights, the right to have the advice of lawyer at every stage of a Court proceeding and the right not to be forced to testify against oneself during such a proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.617" offset="3905808">Now, may it please this Court, I'd like to read just a bit further from Judge Desmond's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.693" offset="3954186">Now, we accept as evidence a confession extracted during the very course of a judicial proceeding after indictment and surrender on a bench warrant.</text>
