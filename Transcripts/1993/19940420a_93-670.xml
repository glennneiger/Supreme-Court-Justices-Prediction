            <text syncTime="56.738" offset="379722">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="59.490" offset="390693">In Scindia Steam Navigation Company v. De Los Santos, this Court held that a shipowner's duty of care owed to longshoremen extended to unsafe conditions existing at the start of cargo operations and that, as to such conditions, the shipowner had a duty of inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.761" offset="455790">The Scindia decision did not specifically address the issue of whether this duty applied to unsafe conditions existing in a cargo stow.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.595" offset="487137">Nor did it make any distinction based on who may have created a particular unsafe condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.868" offset="508140">Rather, the focus of the Scindia decision was on the shipowner's knowledge of an unsafe condition, with the principle issue in Scindia being the ship... on the shipowner's duty of inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.627" offset="551190">Thus, in Scindia, this Court held that, as to unsafe conditions existing at the start of cargo operations, the shipowner had a duty of inspection and was charged with knowledge of those conditions, which would have been discovered by a reasonable inspection, but that once cargo operations began, the shipowner had no ongoing or continuing duty of inspection to discover unsafe conditions which might arise within the confines of those cargo operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.083" offset="653067">In Derr v. Kawasaki Kisen K.K., the Third Circuit erroneously interpreted Scindia as relieving a shipowner from any duty of inspection with respect to unsafe conditions in a cargo stow, no matter when or by whom that condition was created, and without regard to whether a particular unsafe condition may have existed at the start of cargo operations.</text>

            <text syncTime="182.542" offset="882840">I'm not clear on what the reference is to functions, but longshoremen would place... take the cargo from the cargo hook, move it into the stow, and place it in the position... and, presumably, in some manner, that cargo would be secured in place and you'd end up with a cargo stow that would be presented to the discharging longshoreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.209" offset="945534">And that is... then becomes a factual, physical condition that exists at the time the unloading longshoremen go aboard the ship.</text>

            <text syncTime="3056.802" offset="12379957">First of all, one of the problems in the record in this case is that the District Court judge did resolve issues of... where there really are factual issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.007" offset="12412767">Because there is a factual issue here as to knowledge of the shipowner and the captain of this condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.571" offset="12438994">Because we presented the testimony that the ship supplied it; that the... required something to be placed under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.065" offset="12460937">That alone is sufficient to at least raise a factual issue to be determined by a factfinder as to whether they would have actual knowledge of its presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.120" offset="12493224">It's an inference to be drawn from those facts alone.</text>

            <text syncTime="3087.243" offset="12501688">Well, I thought there was also testimony that plastic is used for a lot of things?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Sovel</label>
            <text syncTime="3090.666" offset="12515376">Well, first of all, there was no testimony of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.246" offset="12521750">There was none.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.898" offset="12528332">And that's a very important point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.468" offset="12534602">That was an argument by Mr. Buchholz that, well, it could have been used for other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.490" offset="12550693">The only other evidence in this record as to another use of the plastic was to the... in connection with the loading of corrosive drums... drums containing corrosive materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.386" offset="12590295">And there was testimony that the only cargo... other cargo loaded in this port was bananas, which are not corrosive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.829" offset="12612029">Now, this argument that it could have been used for some other purposes... let them bring in the witnesses; let them be cross-examined as to whether any of these purposes are reasonable purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.586" offset="12643062">There was never an iota of evidence in this record, other than counsel's argument, as to that being a permissible purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.590" offset="12671066">Now, under Mr. Buchholz's argument, and the real problem that you're having... I think Your Honor has touched on it... as Mr. Buchholz says, if I... even though you question my captain and my chief mate, and he says, we did this, we observed the cargo, and if he says, I didn't see it, then I can't establish a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.771" offset="12739820">Because unless he admits to seeing it, then there's no evidence of that--</text>

            <text syncTime="3152.786" offset="12763852">A jury would be entitled to say, even though he doesn't admit to seeing it, we infer from other evidence that he did see it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3164.564" offset="12810977">But in... in this case, there was evidence on which they could find that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.086" offset="12821113">But under Mr. Buchholz's test, if he brings in somebody to say, on a motion for summary judgment... that he produces a deposition of a captain who says, I didn't see it, the plaintiff is out of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.961" offset="12860610">And I don't think that's anywhere in the law of negligence that you can't have a reason to know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.484" offset="12878687">Now, I would want to address one issue because when Justice Scalia questioned me on the language of the statute, it sort of caught me short and I want to go back to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.657" offset="12907317">The statutory language which you quoted reads: If such person... now, person there refers to injured longshoremen, because it's in the second sentence of the Act... and by the way, this appears on page three of my initial brief, the blue brief... it says: If such person was employed by the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.319" offset="12970011">The injured person is not employed by the vessel.</text>
