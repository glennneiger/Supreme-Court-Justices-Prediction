            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="7.512" offset="121007">The first opinion which I have in announcement is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation versus Meyer, No. 92-741.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.200" offset="159772">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.546" offset="185163">Acting as a receiver for a failed thrift institution, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, FSLIC, discharge the respondent, Meyer, who was a senior officer of the thrift.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.336" offset="240334">In a suit against FSLIC, respondent claim that his discharge deprived him of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.561" offset="265202">After the jury returned the verdict in respondent's favor, FSLIC's statutory successor, petitioner Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, FDIC, appealed and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.698" offset="325807">First, the court found that although the remedy under the Federal Tort Claims Act is exclusive for all claims cognizable under 1346(b) of the Act, respondent's constitutional claim was not so cognizable.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.534" offset="389127">Second, it determined that FSLIC's sue-and-be-sued clause constituted a waiver of sovereign immunity for the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.895" offset="426535">And third, it concluded on the merits that respondent had been deprived of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.908" offset="454642">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.572" offset="469271">Like the Court of Appeals, we find that respondent's claim is not cognizable under Section 1346(b) of the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.468" offset="508873">A claim that is cognizable under Section 1346(b) if it is actionable under that Section, and it is actionable if it alleges, among other things, that the United States would be liable in accordance with the law of the place where the act occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.319" offset="576269">The reference to the law of the place means that the law of the state, and by definition, federal law is not state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.846" offset="610332">Federal law, not state law, provides the source of substantive liability for a claim alleging the depravation of federal constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.970" offset="646799">We also agree with the Court of Appeals that FSLIC's sue-and-be-sued clause waives sovereign immunity for respondent's claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.415" offset="680654">Petitioner fails to make the clear showing of congressional purpose necessary to overcome the presumption that immunity has been waived by the clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.564" offset="721196">Contrary to the Court of Appeals, however, we hold that respondent has no cause of action for damages against an agency of the Federal Government, in this case, FSLIC's.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.827" offset="766231">In Bivens versus Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents, we implied a damages remedy against federal agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.229" offset="795906">Respondent argues that the logic of Bivens supports extending the damages remedy from the agents to the agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.293" offset="824118">We disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.742" offset="829970">We implied a cause of action in Bivens against the agents in part because a direct action against the agency was not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.485" offset="864869">In essence, respondent asked us to imply a damages action based on a decision that itself presumed the absence of that very action.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.027" offset="907083">The opinion is unanimous.</text>
