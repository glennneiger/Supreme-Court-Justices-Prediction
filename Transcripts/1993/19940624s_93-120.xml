            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="8.647" offset="125678">The petitioner here is Thomas Jefferson University which is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the dispute is between a teaching hospital that is run by the University and the Secretary of Health and Human Services.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.427" offset="180744">The dispute is over the scope of Medicare reimbursement for costs relating to the hospital's education and training programs for interns and residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.275" offset="224108">Although Medicare reimbursed its hospitals for the cost of certain educational activities, Medicare is forbidden by regulation from reimbursing costs that have been redistributed from a medical school to a hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.947" offset="278860">All agreed that the cost here in dispute were born in prior years, not by the hospital but by the hospital's affiliated medical school.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.744" offset="309998">The Secretary determined these costs were not reimbursable because they were the result of an impermissible redistribution under the pertinent regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.205" offset="339882">The District Court and the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit both affirmed the Secretary's interpretation of its regulation, as do we.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.002" offset="367050">In reviewing an agency's interpretation of its own regulation, we must defer to the Secretary's construction of the language unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.948" offset="406860">In our view, the Secretary's interpretation is not only a plausible interpretation it is the most sensible interpretation the language will bear.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.841" offset="434445">The pertinent sentence of the regulation provides as follows:</text>
            <text syncTime="88.688" offset="445835">Although we intended the Medicare programers to share in the support of the educational activities customarily or traditionally carried on by providers in conjunction with their operations, it is not intended that this program should participate in increased costs resulting from redistribution of cost from educational institutions or units to patient care institutions or units.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.135" offset="531621">We agree with the Secretary that the meaning of this sentence is straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.781" offset="546145">Its introductory clause defines the scope of educational activities for which reimbursement maybe sought and its second clause provides that the cost of these activities will not be reimbursed if they result from a shift of cost from an educational to a patient care facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.224" offset="603928">Because the disputed cost in this case was shifted from a medical school to the hospital, the Secretary was within her discretion in concluding that reimbursement would constitute an impermissible redistribution under the terms of the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.350" offset="656486">And finally, because the application of this portion of the regulation suffices to bar reimbursement in the case, we need not address whether there is any other language in the regulation that may provide an independent reason for denial of reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.432" offset="704761">The decision of the Third Circuit is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.546" offset="713224">Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Stevens, O'Connor, and Ginsburg join.</text>
