            <label>Mr. Jerold S. Solovy</label>
            <text syncTime="9.772" offset="39079">Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.491" offset="49946">Congress included in the Interstate Detainer Act three legislative imperatives which are very helpful in keeping in mind to resolve this case properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.346" offset="93309">The first is that the receiving State, in this case Indiana, when it was the actant in putting the prisoner to trial, had to try the prisoner within 120 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.423" offset="145659">The second is that if the trial did not take place within 120 days, the trial court in Indiana was mandated to dismiss the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.129" offset="184424">And the third is that the courts of the United States are directed by Congress to enforce the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.766" offset="210965">Now, these provisions -- if I might call the Court's attention to these provisions -- are found at pages 6a of our opening brief.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="63.573" stopTime="74.548">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="63.573" offset="254224">Mr. Solovy, you said Congress put these in the Act, but the Act really didn't apply to any State unless the State voluntarily adopted it, isn't that right?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jerold S. Solovy</label>
            <text syncTime="74.548" offset="298109">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.131" offset="300513">48 States have voluntarily opted into the Interstate Detainer Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.952" offset="319739">Congress adopted the Act in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.820" offset="339278">Each of the States solemnly swear to abide by the agreement.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="89.558" offset="358191">So Congress' participation in it can easily be called a Federal law, but I don't know how the Interstate Act itself qualifies as a Federal law.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jerold_s_solovy" startTime="100.948" stopTime="116.125">

            <text syncTime="100.948" offset="403749">Well, with all due respect, Justice Scalia, I think the Court treaded this ground in Cuyler and in Carchman, and, indeed, in taking the certiorari in Fex v. Michigan--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="116.125" stopTime="117.075">

            <label>Mr. Jerold S. Solovy</label>
            <text syncTime="117.075" offset="468219">--For -- well, I don't see what the jurisdiction of the Court would have been to grant certiorari in Fex if this were not a Federal law.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="124.231" stopTime="136.372">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="124.231" offset="496849">Oh, I think it's one thing to say that we have jurisdiction over interstate agreements and quite another thing to say that for purposes of habeas corpus we would be enforcing a Federal law.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jerold_s_solovy" startTime="136.372" stopTime="161.404">
            <label>Mr. Jerold S. Solovy</label>
            <text syncTime="136.372" offset="545437">Well, with all due respect, Justice Scalia, I fail to see the distinction for -- if this Court has jurisdiction for certiorari and jurisdiction to take a case on certiorari, then I cannot see how it doesn't qualify under 2254 as a Federal law to be enforced under habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.718" offset="634776">That's not the Government -- position the Solicitor takes in this case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="161.404" stopTime="180.817">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="161.404" offset="645538">Perhaps enforceable, but not necessarily to be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.891" offset="663510">We have discretion under habeas corpus jurisdiction, and perhaps real Federal laws that the States have to observe, whether they like it or not, may be treated differently from voluntary State agreements such as this one.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jerold_s_solovy" startTime="180.817" stopTime="212.051">
            <label>Mr. Jerold S. Solovy</label>
            <text syncTime="180.817" offset="723174">Again, Justice Scalia, with all due respect, this is a real Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.785" offset="739056">I don't see an order of law that says that the Interstate Detainer Act is a stepchild which is not entitled to be accorded habeas corpus relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.791" offset="779076">Of course, the writ is always discretionary, but Congress here has spoken very loudly, and if this Court does not exercise and adopt Federal rules as the Court did in Fex, then you're going to have havoc.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.301" offset="845113">For example--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="212.051" stopTime="214.686">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="212.051" offset="848144">Can a State get out of this interstate agreement?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jerold_s_solovy" startTime="214.686" stopTime="215.621">
            <label>Mr. Jerold S. Solovy</label>
            <text syncTime="214.686" offset="858697">--Of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.153" offset="860578">A State can opt out tomorrow.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="215.621" stopTime="234.082">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="215.621" offset="862459">Well, I don't see how -- if a State violates its own law, we don't accept habeas corpus because a State can change its law.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.275" offset="893074">So, also, it seems to me, if a State violates the interstate agreement, we shouldn't enforce it by habeas corpus because if a State doesn't like it it can simply pull out of the agreement anyway.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jerold_s_solovy" startTime="234.082" stopTime="291.503">
            <label>Mr. Jerold S. Solovy</label>
            <text syncTime="234.082" offset="936229">That would be a very hollow agreement indeed, and such a ruling would cause all of the States to opt out and disappear from this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.974" offset="979801">The reason, I submit, that you decided Mauro, Cuyler, Carchman, and Fex, is to say here is a national law which we're going to adopt uniformly.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.198" offset="1028702">For example, Justice Scalia, in Fex you said that -- for the Court, that the 180 days ran when the receiving State received the notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.553" offset="1070184">Now, if that's not a Federal law, then perhaps Iowa is going to say quite the opposite, it's going to say when the prisoner's accepted, and you're going to have havoc and chaos if you don't have one national rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.897" offset="1127549">So it doesn't -- with all due respect, it doesn't seem we should tarry very long on that position of the State of Indiana.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="291.503" stopTime="299.359">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="291.503" offset="1166002">Mr. Solovy, I guess you concede there's no constitutional violation of the speedy trial clause here.</text>

            <text syncTime="299.359" offset="1197349">Well, this Court said, Justice O'Connor, in deciding Carchman, that Congress had in mind in passing this Act, at least in part the prisoner's speedy trial constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.034" offset="1256072">Now so--</text>

            <text syncTime="324.890" offset="1299540">No, I do -- not directly, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.525" offset="1310093">It was not directly violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.759" offset="1318975">But the implication of the Constitution--</text>

            <text syncTime="331.827" offset="1327229">Are you treating this, then, as though -- as a counterpart to the Speedy Trial Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.215" offset="1344784">That is, there are firm deadlines in the Speedy Trial Act that don't necessarily coincide with what the Constitution would require absent -- just by itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1154.583" offset="4618240">Both seem to be intended at the same thing, a backup to a speedy trial, kind of a firm line on speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.589" offset="4654289">But certainly in the Speedy Trial Act we know it's waivable; here you concede it's waivable, but you say it hasn't been waived.</text>

            <text syncTime="1180.817" offset="4723252">Congress or the legislature says that we are going to step in the place of the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.573" offset="4750211">We're going to give you a bright line, and in this case it's 120 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.791" offset="4767138">And all -- virtually every State has a Speedy Trial Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.643" offset="4782498">Every State knows the harsh penalty that -- if you don't comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.631" offset="4798485">And in Barker, the Court said that, look, we're not going to tell you State courts what that bright line is; that's up to the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.237" offset="4836937">And here the legislatures of the 48 States and Congress said that the 120th day is the bright line and prejudice after that is presumed, because the prisoner should be released.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.996" offset="4891899">And I do say it's very akin to jurisdiction, which is traditional habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.031" offset="4912065">And this is a case, I say, which will very seldom be replicated because everybody is aware of speedy trial provisions, everybody is aware of the 120-day provision, but it so happens in this case the prosecuting attorney, although he signed that solemn agreement to try them within 120 days, never alerted the trial court, and the trial court didn't bother to read the Detainer Act and the rule was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.616" offset="5018436">I suggest to you that that is very seldom going to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.068" offset="5032229">It does not intrude in any way upon, I think, the sovereignty of the State of Indiana because, as Chief Justice Edwards said in his dissenting opinion in Mars, every State, in signing this Detainer Act, gave up a little bit of their sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.262" offset="5100983">They solemnly agreed to abide by these rules, and when the rules are broken the statute says in bright lights this is what will happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.468" offset="5137868">And, Justice Souter, the question about going to Congress; here if Indiana wants not to abide by these rules, then it should go to the State legislatures and it should go to Congress and say make this a discretionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.295" offset="5197113">The Solicitor General and the State of Indiana attempt to make much of the fact that when Congress -- that Congress amended this Act in 1988 -- and that's set forth at the back of our appendix in our brief -- and Congress tacked onto this Act the mirror image of the Federal Speedy Trial Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.124" offset="5276421">And that is when the rule is violated for a Federal -- when the Federal Government is the receiving State, the Federal court, district court has discretion either to dismiss the case with prejudice or without prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.968" offset="5327830">Now, that's a right which they chose not to give to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.503" offset="5346011">And we respectfully suggest that that shows that Congress meant what it said, and that is when the line here is crossed -- and, as I say, it'll seldom be crossed -- then the habeas corpus relief must be granted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1495.074" offset="5980264">Petitioner has suggested at various points that Congress decided not to give the States this or that right, or Congress said what it meant in the IAD.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.179" offset="6016627">The simple fact is that the IAD was an agreement that the States voluntarily entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.981" offset="6039824">This Court detailed the background and history of that in United States v. Mauro, the underlying materials themselves detail that, and so I wanted to make that point clear.</text>

            <text syncTime="1547.820" offset="6191229">And this Court has held in many cases which involved original actions, but also in cases on certiorari from the State courts, that, in essence, this Court must have the power to have the final say on--</text>

            <text syncTime="1611.013" offset="6443990">And as this Court has noted, those terms take their meaning from context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.083" offset="6468232">The context of the habeas statute was reconstruction -- the reconstruction -- Congress was anticipating, in essence, resistance to the civil rights acts that it either had passed or was planning to pass, as well as to the post-Civil War amendments, and it wanted to provide a forum in the Federal district courts to deal with that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1786.091" offset="7144281">Also, in some of the cases applying the fundamental defect and miscarriage of justice standard, the Court has relied upon 2254 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.917" offset="7195585">Stone v. Powell itself also referred to the fundamental defect, inherent miscarriage of justice standard and, of course, Stone was a 2254 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.075" offset="7244278">So, in fact, we do believe that that standard applies under either, and there is not a reason to differentiate between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.247" offset="7284924">And to the extent there is any reason at all, it should be more difficult, rather than less difficult, to get relief from the judgment of a State court, because there is an overlay of Federalism involved that simply is absent in 2255.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.840" offset="7343334">In terms of our jurisdictional argument -- and I guess, by way of example of what we mean probably is a law of the United States as opposed to what is not, I think it's useful to look at some of the earlier cases under the Habeas Corpus Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.872" offset="7431419">In fact, one of the first cases decided under that Act involved an alleged violation of the 1866 Civil Rights Act, and then Chief Justice Chase, sitting as circuit justice, held that that was a violation of a law of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.167" offset="7504666">I think it's also significant to note that -- or at least to recognize that the drafters of the habeas corpus statutes knew what interstate compacts were, most likely, and they are certainly not listed as a ground for habeas corpus relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.847" offset="7587318">The primary argument that petitioner seems to make is that this Court's decisions in Cuyler v. Adams and Carchman v. Nash foreclose the argument that we're making here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.090" offset="7644264">We don't believe that that is the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.725" offset="7654818">Cuyler v. Adams was a section 1983 case rather than a habeas corpus case, but more importantly, in that case there were alleged violations of due process and equal protection, so there was never any question about the district court's jurisdiction there and the IAD was merely construed in order to avoid reaching those constitutional questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1977.533" offset="7910087">It simply said that the Third Circuit here has held that the IAD presents questions of Federal law which there's Federal power to construe, and we have to decide whether that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.691" offset="7962749">Again, no jurisdictional question was involved and so, of course, the Court didn't refer to any of the jurisdictional statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.279" offset="7993051">Carchman v. Nash, another of the cases relied upon by petitioner, simply did not explicitly discuss a jurisdictional point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.087" offset="8044251">And as this Court has repeatedly held, where a case simply reaches the merits, as Carchman did, without discussing the jurisdictional point, it's not to be viewed as binding when the jurisdictional question is subsequently squarely raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.930" offset="8107677">Fex v. Michigan we believe, frankly, in essence proves our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.052" offset="8140173">The Court granted certiorari, but our argument basically is that the certiorari statute has much different terms and different language than the habeas corpus statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.260" offset="8192940">And so for all of those reasons, we believe that there simply was not jurisdiction to entertain the habeas corpus claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.199" offset="8224705">Secondly, even if there were jurisdiction to entertain the claim, relief should nonetheless be denied for the reasons this Court gave in Stone v. Powell and the analysis that it has followed and refined as recently as last term in Withrow v. Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.428" offset="8297639">In essence, what that analysis recognizes is that habeas corpus is an equitable remedy and it is therefore discretionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.052" offset="8336196">The language of 28 U.S.C. section 2244 explicitly recognizes that the granting of relief is discretionary.</text>

            <text syncTime="2827.061" offset="11308199">And, again, I think the flexibility built into the IAD is one of the reasons that we don't -- we think it doesn't form a proper predicate for habeas corpus relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.654" offset="11358563">It is designed so that the trial court can continue the trial on the basis of good cause, which is one of the lowest standards that could be listed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.677" offset="11402658">The trial court can grant any reasonable continuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.112" offset="11412376">It is not designed as a rigid set of rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.598" offset="11434318">I would like to point out, however, we don't believe the merits of the IAD are within the scope of the Court's grant of review in this case, and the merits of the alleged violation, and they weren't, in fact, passed on by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.025" offset="11491997">On the -- the other points, I guess, on the Stone analysis -- apart from the notion that this is, in essence, unrelated to the soundness of the trial, we also know that it's not a federally imposed obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.772" offset="11570991">And even if it technically is a Federal law of some species enough to confer jurisdiction, which we don't think it is, we believe the essentially non-Federal nature of it is an additional equitable factor counseling against the grant of habeas corpus relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.233" offset="11640895">We know it's not such a Federal requirement because it does not apply in all States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.387" offset="11669525">And I believe there was a statement earlier that there was some notion of a national uniform mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.839" offset="11691259">That's simply not accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.624" offset="11698469">There are two States in which it doesn't apply at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.743" offset="11706932">Even in the States where it does apply, it applies to only the tiniest portion of criminal defendants, those who are incarcerated for crimes committed elsewhere, which I might point out are -- almost by definition it applies to repeat offenders, which ups the ante on the cost side of the Withrow scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.989" offset="11787912">I guess finally on the fundamental defect point, I'd just like to note not only has this Court not distinguished between section 2255 and 2254; this Court has also rejected the notion that there's some sort of unencumbered right to litigate Federal issues in Federal courts, which seems to be what petitioner's argument is premised on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.390" offset="11897522">The Court rejected that, we believe, in Swain v. Pressley, and also rejected that in Allen v. McCrory.</text>

            <text syncTime="3045.653" offset="12182570">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.605" offset="12198348">On this tolling issue, there was simply nothing present before the trial court that would have impeded the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.578" offset="12238263">And even if you read section 6 of the Interstate Detainer Act to allow motions to toll the statute, that has to be determined by the trial court and the trial court had very speedily passed upon all pending motions and the trial court simply denied the motion in September, 1983 because he said he had never heard of the Act before, not because the motions had impeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.777" offset="12335020">Now, this Court is well aware, of course, that time limits have very important significance to lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.348" offset="12361352">If you get on the 91st day the best certiorari petition you have ever read in your entire judicial career, unless an extension has been granted, Congress says forget that petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.321" offset="12413283">You have no authority to -- you can read it, but you can't grant it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.142" offset="12432509">In Coleman v. Thompson, a death penalty case, the Court did not consider the position of the petitioner in that case because his counsel had filed his appeal to the Virginia Supreme Court on the 33rd day rather than the 30th day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.918" offset="12499592">Time is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.104" offset="12508369">Time constraints are important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.704" offset="12514743">The IAD says exactly what would happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.341" offset="12529267">And for whatever significance one can draw from it, no State has filed an amicus in this case supporting Indiana because, I submit, it is clear the time limitation of 4(c) is crystal clear and these cases rarely happen, but Mr. Reed has spent 11 years in the penitentiary in violation of a law of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.271" offset="12621009">And, lastly, I started to mention Alvarez, and that was a kidnapping case, and to determine whether the Court had jurisdiction to try the doctor in that case, who had been kidnapped from Mexico, the Court carefully looked at the extradition treaty with Mexico and decided that nothing was amiss by kidnapping and bringing him here, and the Court had jurisdiction to try it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.935" offset="12703660">If you look at the IAD, something is very amiss here, and that is that the treaty by which Indiana got Mr. Reed from the Federal jurisdiction said you must try him within 120 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.944" offset="12755696">That didn't happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.877" offset="12759458">We submit that the writ should be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.062" offset="12772206">Unless you have any other questions, that concludes my argument.</text>
