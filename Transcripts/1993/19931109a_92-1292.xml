            <text syncTime="1524.509" offset="6250916">The argument I just heard seems to have omitted three decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.715" offset="6279651">And I'd like to talk about those three decisions, and those were Sony, Harper &amp; Row, and Stewart v. Abend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.018" offset="6308908">In each of those opinions this Court, presumably looking at the first factor, namely the factor of purpose and character of the use, stated unequivocally that every commercial use of copyrighted material is presumptively unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.782" offset="6388007">Now, there's been no discussion of that here, and in fact it's overlooked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.586" offset="6407233">In the petitioner's view once it's a parody you look to the impairment of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.871" offset="6424370">And I'm going to come to impairment of the market, because there's substantial evidence of impairment of the derivative market, including the market for rap versions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.275" offset="6453940">But I'd like to talk about the significance of that commercial presumption.</text>

            <text syncTime="1586.248" offset="6497826">But in Harper &amp; Row it was not in dictum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.034" offset="6516948">As I recall, in Harper &amp; Row they applied that presumption to the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.188" offset="6537636">And it was in dictum in Sony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.973" offset="6544742">And it was not in dictum in Stewart and Abend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.889" offset="6552370">Indeed in Stewart v. Abend, it was applied in a very straightforward fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.507" offset="6570864">The Court said Hitchcock and Stewart made 12 million on Rear Window and that was enough to meet the presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.577" offset="6599181">But my view of the presumption is a little subtler than I think petitioners give us credit for, or even give the Sixth Circuit credit for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.600" offset="6631259">And the Sixth Circuit could have been clearer on this, I acknowledge, but I believe that the commercial use presumption means something like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.336" offset="6658218">You have to look at the commerciality to see what purpose the so-called parodist or news reporter or critic or comment... commentator is doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.311" offset="6710045">There's a wonderful article by Judge LaValle in wnich he modestly reassesses his own opinion on the Salinger letters case, and he acknowledges he made an error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.167" offset="6749542">He was ultimately reversed by the Second Circuit but he acknowledges he made an error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.202" offset="6761663">He said the letters were being used for purposes of biography.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.321" offset="6774097">But he saw something else in reviewing the record, and that was that the letters were also being used to dazzle, to have a good read, just not for the purpose of biography, but to sell the work for the expressive value of the underlying copyrighted material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.215" offset="6845672">That's what happened in Harper &amp; Row.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.500" offset="6854868">The Nation was engaged in news reporting, but the court said that the Nation went further and was expressing... and was exploiting the 300 words taken verbatim from President Ford's book for their expressive value so that people would know it's Ford speaking.</text>

            <text syncTime="1745.571" offset="7135109">But according to their expert, and they adopt that view, that the record was being sold to an audience... what they described as an audience of urban black youth or disaffected black urban youth.</text>
