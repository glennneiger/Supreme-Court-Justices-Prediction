            <text syncTime="8.222" offset="124325">this case comes to us from the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals and it concerns a trial of the petitioner for paternity and child support, and the state used nine of its ten peremptory challenges to remove male jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.679" offset="210215">It was claimed that the reasoning of a case called Batson against Kentucky in which this Court held that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits peremptory strikes based solely on the race extends to forbid gender-based peremptory challenges and that claim was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.297" offset="292658">The jury found petitioner to be the father of the child and ordered him to pay a child support and the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="63.301" offset="344694">We hold that the Equal Protection Clause prohibits discrimination in jury selection on the basis of gender or on the assumption that an individual will be biased in a particular case solely because that person happens to be a woman or a man.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.431" offset="409164">Justice O'Connor although joining the Court's opinion has filed a separate concurring opinion; Justice Kennedy has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment; The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion; Justice Scalia has also filed a dissenting opinion and has joined therein by the Chief Justice and by Justice Thomas.</text>
