            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="11.198" offset="135765">This is the opinion in Central Bank of Denver versus First Interstate Bank of Denver.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.412" offset="152587">The case presents an issue we have twice read before and we reach it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.622" offset="173485">The issue is whether in a suit based on Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, a plaintiffs may sue and recover damages from a party alleged to have done no more than aid and abet the violation of securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.858" offset="226462">The complaint in this case alleged a securities fraud in the issuance of bonds to finance public improvements for a plan residential community in Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.065" offset="263242">The allegation was that the bonds were issued in reliance on an appraisal that reflected earlier land values that should have been readjusted to take account of a declining real estate market.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.328" offset="308277">The petitioner, Central Bank of Denver, served as the indenture trustee for the bond issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.252" offset="323951">According to the complaint, Central Bank did not itself commit a violation to Securities Act but it did aid and abet of violation by agreeing to postpone an independent review of the land valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.235" offset="367941">The District Court granted summary judgment to Central Bank but the Tenth Circuit disagreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.289" offset="384137">Consistent with the Tenth Circuit's precedents, the court stated that the private plaintiffs may sue and recover damages from a party who aids and abets the violation of Section 10(b) of the 1934 Act, and the court further held that there was sufficient evidence to create a triable issue of fact on the question whether Central Bank had aided and abetted the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.119" offset="455503">In the opinion filed today, we reverse the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.379" offset="472535">We hold that the sue for aiding and abetting a 10(b) violation is not available under the federal securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.899" offset="498553">Our case is considering the scope of conduct prohibited by Section 10(b) have emphasized adherence to the statutory language and we have refused to allow challenges to conduct not prohibited by the text of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.285" offset="548081">It would be inconsistent with settled methodology in Section 10(b) cases to extend liability to aiding and abetting.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.877" offset="578488">The statue does not include giving aid to a person who commits a manipulative or deceptive act.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.936" offset="598759">We cannot immune the statute to create liability for acts that are not themselves manipulative or deceptive within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.154" offset="627598">Respondents make a number of non-textual arguments for the imposition of aiding and abetting liability under Section 10(b) but none of which leads us to a different answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.351" offset="660408">We cannot assume, as respondents urged, that Congress implicitly intended to impose aiding and abetting liability in the Securities Act of 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.982" offset="694890">Congress imposed some forms of secondary liability in the 1934 Act but did not include aiding and abetting liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.416" offset="720699">That indicates the congressional choice with which the courts should not interfere.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.665" offset="737626">Respondents also point that post 1934 legislative developments to support the various post-1934 congresses have acquiesced in the aiding and abetting cause of action recognized by some Federal Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.619" offset="789453">But, as we have held before, Congress' failure to overturn statutory decisions reached by the Federal Courts is not itself a reason to adhere to those decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.853" offset="830413">Congressional inaction cannot amend a duly enacted statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.356" offset="844414">In this case, the Securities and Exchange Act passed by Congress in 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.412" offset="860610">The Securities and Exchange Commission also makes various policy arguments in support of aiding and abetting liability under Section 10(b), but those arguments do not show that adherence to the statutory text would lead to a result Congress would not have intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.802" offset="918184">We note, indeed, that there are many policy arguments against the imposition of aiding and abetting liability under Section 10(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="213.200" offset="943784">We hold that a private plaintiff may not maintain an aiding and abetting suit under Section 10(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="218.648" offset="965623">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion which is joined by Justice Blackmun, Justice Souter, and Justice Ginsburg.</text>
