            <text syncTime="13.020" offset="202508">We're here today discussing 21 U.S.C. 857, which is referred to and I will refer to it as the drug paraphernalia statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.177" offset="251096">The question is whether or not it contains a subjective scienter, and when the trial judge applied 857 without a subjective scienter in his instructions 37 and 39, did he deny the petitioner her due process rights?</text>
            <text syncTime="39.286" offset="307520">The court, we believe, erroneously applied 857, because when it instructed the jury it instructed the jury without any intent requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.374" offset="347958">On the other hand, if this statute does not contain any intent requirement, as the trial judge found and the Eighth Circuit affirmed, then the statute is unconstitutional and the conviction cannot stand.</text>

            <text syncTime="97.754" offset="541473">I reread the Morissette case because you cite it in your brief, and I didn't read that as saying anything about a lack of intent making a statute unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="119.650" offset="629035">If no mens rea statute is in it, if no mens rea requirement is in it, then we believe you have to look at the intent of the legislature.</text>

            <text syncTime="147.498" offset="740421">Also it seems to be indicated in the Hoffman's Estates case also, because in that decision the Court indicates that... in their questioning to counsel and also in the decision, that some intent must be found in the statute to save its vagueness.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.805" offset="789636">So we talk about that over and over again in the line of cases that follow the Hoffman Estates case.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.629" offset="812937">You look for some intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.540" offset="816594">However, those were preenforcement cases and in preenforcement challenges to the facial constitutionality of the statute, the Court seems to save it solely because there is some intent requirement in the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1487.482" offset="6100330">Well, I think we certainly changed our approach to the case in this respect, in that in the lower courts the thrust of the argument being made by the defendants was that a subjective intent was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.271" offset="6151530">That is... and this was the basis for the objections that were made in the district court... that the defendant herself had to have designed or intended the drug use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.697" offset="6193221">And we said that was not so, and the district judge agreed with us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.411" offset="6204088">So the question of where the intent, where the knowledge lay, and so forth, was really not the focus of the district court proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.215" offset="6235331">In the court of appeals, the argument was made... the principal argument made by the defendants was that this statute has no scienter requirement at all and therefore is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.370" offset="6275873">So, again, as the court of appeals pointed out, they did not argue for a particular scienter requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.755" offset="6301473">They didn't press the issue of knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.788" offset="6309623">They were looking for a constitutional ruling based on an assumption of no scienter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.000" offset="6326446">So we are addressing the case as it now comes to the Court, and addressing in particular the question that's raised in the petition.</text>

            <text syncTime="2401.421" offset="9756114">"nature, character, and use of the items being sold or offered for sale at the store. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.211" offset="9771265">Again, instruction 18, where the court is discussing the evidence which has been offered on the good faith defense, the court says that you can consider the good faith if it's</text>

            <text syncTime="2486.476" offset="10096333">Your Honor, we don't think the existence of the word 857... the prior statute is critical, but we think it's illuminating, particularly because there's no indication that when the 1990 change was made in the statute and the word (a), that there was any... there's no indication there was any intention to remove a mens rea requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.501" offset="10192464">So what we make of the word 857(a) is that it reflects a congressional understanding that there would be a knowledge requirement, that there would be awareness on the part of the defendant that the defendant was doing something unlawful, and that there was no indication in 1990 that that fundamental change... excuse me... change in the statute was intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.745" offset="10281385">So, yes, we don't put principal weight on the word "scheme", but we certainly think it's illuminating in telling us what Congress had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.331" offset="10311791">Particularly in light of the fact that we're dealing here with what amounts to a presumption in the construction of Federal statutes that you find mens rea unless there's some clear indication to the contrary, or unless you're in an area involving particular kinds of products.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.702" offset="10385248">Now, in this area we think that assumption, that rule of construction applies.</text>

            <text syncTime="2586.320" offset="10495693">Well, maybe that's also a presumption.</text>

            <text syncTime="2590.554" offset="10512621">Well, we make the concession because we think that... I would say it's the first, principally, of your... of the two options.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.797" offset="10541564">We think that if you read the Court's cases such as Gypsum, Bailey, Liparota, and Morissette, what you find is there is this canon of construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.235" offset="10587331">And in a sense it's just like the rule that this court has recognized, that you read into Federal statutes the defense of entrapment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.710" offset="10621290">There's no statutory defense of entrapment, but we understand Congress to legislate against a background in which Federal criminal statutes all have, unless otherwise negated, a defense of entrapment or duress or necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.179" offset="10671132">This is just one of the ingredients that is assumed to be present in Federal statutes, unless the statute falls into one of those rare cases in which it can be either assumed that there is no such requirement or in which Congress indicates to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.088" offset="10726720">Now, one of the reasons for that, of course, is that there are constitutional concerns with statutes that have absolutely no mens rea except where certain kinds of items are at issue, and the International Minerals case discusses that concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.866" offset="10785861">But I think the basic point is... and my basic answer to you is it's the rule of construction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2732.747" offset="11081359">So that if... you know, if I'm a clerk in a drug store and I have a friend who I know is a drug addict and he comes in... and I know that he doesn't use this type of razor when he shaves, and he comes in and asks for a pack of razors and I just give him a pack over the counter.</text>
