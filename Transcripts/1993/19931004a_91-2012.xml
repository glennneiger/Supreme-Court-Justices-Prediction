            <label>Mr. R. Napier Murphy</label>
            <text syncTime="3290.256" offset="13308973">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.297" offset="13317123">We have a county of 10,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.779" offset="13331021">70 percent of the registered voters, black and white, are registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.862" offset="13359337">Voter registration is equal for both blacks and whites.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.276" offset="13373025">They vote equally in all elections, the same percentages... 29 to 30 to 31 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.511" offset="13401969">It's the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.511" offset="13405940">They have an equal opportunity to participate in that county, whether they are voting for one sole commissioner, one sheriff, or one school board district member.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.509" offset="13453901">We're not talking about benchmarking in order to prove a section 2 claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.892" offset="13471455">We're talking about bootstrapping.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.303" offset="13481172">In these other counties that went from one to three... one to three... why didn't they go one to five?</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.368" offset="13509385">Because three guaranteed proportional representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.921" offset="13527566">If five is the benchmark, these other sole commissioner counties that have decided to change should have gone to five.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.866" offset="13555360">If we're talking about benchmarking, should the Texas legislature, which has only 31 members, be expanded to meet the modal size of State legislatures in this country?</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.114" offset="13608337">There are no workable limits if we start changing or expanding the size of government to determine a vote dilution claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.531" offset="13641982">You look at the existing number of seats.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.931" offset="13655670">This Court refused, in the Beens case referred to by Mr. Coates, to order a reduction of 50 percent in the State Senate of Minnesota and 25 percent in the House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.070" offset="13708229">This Court refused that change even for a constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.322" offset="13725156">We are talking about a 500-percent change in the size of the governing body for this small county.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.298" offset="13753055">That is not a minor change.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.258" offset="13760892">Mr. Coates also referred to sheriffs as having executive authority, but sheriffs make many decisions which affect minorities.</text>

            <text syncTime="3422.772" offset="13838945">Mr. Murphy, if we were to look at the district court decision and go that far, reject your argument as far as the district court did, what would your argument be about what it would take to satisfy the factors that the court of appeals found were not satisfied in this case, the bloc voting and cohesiveness?</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.356" offset="13921283">Let's say that you lose on your main argument, and we're back in the district court, and the district court says, in my view, this case fails for lack of proof on those two items, what would be adequate proof?</text>
