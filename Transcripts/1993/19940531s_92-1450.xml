            <text syncTime="6.315" offset="116664">The first is No. 92-1450, Waters versus Churchill.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.888" offset="146966">The case comes to us on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.250" offset="172462">The petitioners fired respondent, Churchill, because of things she said to a fellow employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.041" offset="203600">The petitioners claimed that, as reported to them, Churchill's statements were disruptive and were not on a matter of public concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.015" offset="247485">Churchill, on the other hand, said that in reality her statements were not disruptive and dealt with a matter of public concern which would make them protected by the First Amendment under the doctrine of Connick versus Myers.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.023" offset="303492">The District Court concluded that to determine whether a government's employment action based on speech violates the First Amendment a court should only consider the speech as the supervisor spot it to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.317" offset="372664">The court, therefore, granted summary judgment for petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.330" offset="388755">The Court of Appeals reversed holding that the inquiry should focus on what is actually said by the employee even if the supervisors were misinformed about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.969" offset="435358">In an opinion filed today, we vacate the judgment and remand the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.078" offset="455733">The plurality opinion holds that the Connick test should be applied to the speech as the supervisor reasonably determined it to be and concludes that in this case, the supervisor's determination was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.114" offset="519890">But, the plurality also concludes that Churchill should be allowed an opportunity to prove that the speech, as it was reported to petitioner, was only a pretext and that the real reason for her discharge was other statements she made earlier, statements that might have been protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.390" offset="604945">The opinion is joined by four members of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.604" offset="621872">Justice Souter who has joined the opinion has also filed a concurring opinion; Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment which Justices Kennedy and Thomas have joined; Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion which Justice Blackmun has joined.</text>
