            <text syncTime="10.540" offset="192803">Incinerators that recover energy from the burning of municipal solid waste, known as resource recovery facilities, received an exemption from Federal hazardous waste regulation under a 1984 amendment to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.460" offset="260513">The question presented here is whether that exemption ceases to have effect once these incinerators actually burn the waste sent there for incineration.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.657" offset="305234">The 1984 amendment is entitled, Clarification of Household Waste Exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.962" offset="330521">On its face, it requires some understanding of what the household waste exclusion was, and what Congress was seeking to clarify in 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.888" offset="366152">Accordingly, I will begin by examining the regulatory framework that confronted Congress when it enacted the statute, and I will then discuss the statute's purpose, history, and its text.</text>

            <text syncTime="72.611" offset="441071">In 1976, Congress first enacted RCRA, creating a comprehensive scheme for the disposal of solid waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.339" offset="480046">RCRA divides solid waste into two categories, hazardous, and nonhazardous.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.022" offset="502720">It creates a far more demanding, expensive, and cumbersome scheme for the disposal of hazardous waste.</text>

            <text syncTime="320.525" offset="1432784">What the statute is saying is that at least at a certain stage they shall not be deemed.</text>

            <text syncTime="332.864" offset="1482103">--That's correct, and what that means, I take it, is that if you think that the resource recovery facility... in this case EDF argues that as the employees of the resource recovery facility are sweeping out the ash from the incinerator and trying to figure out what to do with it, the employees are supposed to treat that ash as hazardous waste and ship it and dispose of it under those regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="355.548" offset="1572800">Well, there may be a period of uncertainty as to when one regime ends and another begins, but I don't see how you can read this as defining the ash as nonhazardous waste as opposed to directing that the recovery facility shall not deemed to be dealing with it, and if you do not read this... and in its plain language it is not a definition of hazardous waste, nor is it a provision saying ash is not, then at most, it seems to me, you can get by plain language is that you don't treat the ash as hazardous waste until it leaves the hands of the recovery facility, but at that point, I don't see how anything in this statute by its terms covers the ash.</text>

            <text syncTime="405.230" offset="1771540">Of course, the only defendant in this case is the resource recovery facility, because I take it even EDF doesn't think that Congress intended to create an exemption where if the resource recovery facility disposes of the material on site at its own landfill, adjacent to the incinerator, Congress would treat all that as exempt, but the fortuity that you instead use an independent contractor off-site, that would trigger a different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.268" offset="1871745">EDF apparently doesn't even think that distinction makes any sense, and I think especially when you put the plain language into the regulatory context, it becomes quite clear, because when EPA defined by regulation what was hazardous in 1980, it bowed to the practical reality.</text>

            <text syncTime="973.388" offset="4044193">In fact, EDF's position on the legislative history, of course, is ignore it, because if you do look at the legislative history, it addresses this problem clearly and expressly, and far from evincing an intent to dramatically narrow the exclusion, it embraces the exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.461" offset="4116500">It states that it recognizes it is a wastestream exclusion, goes on to say that resource recovery facilities should be fit within the household waste exclusion, and it further states that economic impediments to the success of the resource recovery process should be removed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1977.792" offset="8061825">The city claims that section 3001(i)'s plain meaning exempts from subchapter C hazardous waste regulation facilities that that provision never mentions, and generator requirements that that provision never mentions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2936.341" offset="11895974">In those provisions, in section 300(b)(2) and (b)(3), Congress created explicit wastestream exemptions, and that is, for waste associated with the exploration, production, and development of oil and natural gas, and waste from the combustion of coal, in those provisions, Congress, with respect to coal combustion, specifically refers in the statute to fly ash and bottom ash, but at the same time that Congress authorized in those provisions EPA to create a wastestream exemption, Congress imposed significant procedural safeguards because of the environmental risk associated with a wastestream exemption as opposed to a facility exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.354" offset="12044036">In particular, Congress required EPA to study the effects of a wastestream exemption applied to those wastes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3066.407" offset="12416229">Because one of those requirements, in addition to the testing requirements, the determination of whether it's a hazardous waste, the labeling requirement, and the manifest trapping system requirement, which is so essential at the gatekeeper to let the downstream facilities comply with subchapter C, is that the city... also, as a generator, one of the requirements under section 3002 is that the generator assure that the waste is ultimately disposed not by them but by somebody else at a RCRA-permitted facility under section 3004, and that is the distinct generator requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3429.372" offset="13868114">I'd like to first turn to the question whether what we have here is a wastestream exemption, because no one should mistake the boldness of what EDF is asking this Court to hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.079" offset="13914926">EDF is asking this Court to hold that Congress was misrepresenting when it crafted this statute, that Congress in fact wasn't clarifying anything, that that is a misrepresentation, that Congress intended to dramatically narrow the scope of the exemption that these facilities receive if they mix in, to use Mr. Lazarus' words, any nonhazardous commercial and industrial waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.997" offset="14022655">The interesting thing about the record in this case is it shows that 99 percent of what this facility receives is household waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.242" offset="14055569">On EDF's view, because the city mixes in 1 percent, or less than 1 percent, nonhazardous commercial and industrial waste, Congress would have intended a dramatically different result, would have intended to end the wastestream exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.675" offset="14121293">It is, as one of Justice Ginsburg's questions noted, it is the resource recovery facility itself that must find a way to dispose of the ash.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.403" offset="14172284">When that ash is on-site, it is the resource recovery facility's problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.646" offset="14193182">How are you going to dispose of it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.556" offset="14200914">Are you going to have to dispose of it as hazardous waste, and pay $453 a ton, according to EPA's estimates, or can you dispose of it at a more feasible cost of $42 a ton as nonhazardous waste?</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.556" offset="14252846">For all these reasons, I ask the judgment be reversed.</text>
