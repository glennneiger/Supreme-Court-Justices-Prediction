            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="135923">We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 92-1546, United States v. John Irvine and First Trust National Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.039" offset="180018">Mr. Jones.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kent L. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="11.949" offset="183675">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.521" offset="197990">In 1917, Lucius Ordway formed a trust with substantial assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.035" offset="224008">Each of his grandchildren, including Sally Ordway Irvine, was given a remainder interest in the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.020" offset="251907">By 1931, when Mrs. Irvine was 21 years old, she was aware of her remainder interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.164" offset="280537">In 1966, when her father died, she became entitled to receive and did receive each year a portion of the income from the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.823" offset="323169">In 1979, when the trust terminated, Mrs. Irvine was entitled to receive one-thirteenth of the corpus of the trust, which then exceeded $1/2 billion in value.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.730" offset="374787">Mrs. Irvine at that time was 68 years old and had five adult children.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.265" offset="396939">She determined that she did not need her entire share of this enormous fortune, and filed a written disclaimer of a portion of her interest in the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.751" offset="438839">Under the disclaimer, each of her children received one-sixteenth of her interest in the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.425" offset="469559">Mrs. Irvine retained the remaining eleven sixteenths of her interest for herself.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.880" offset="491397">The Federal gift tax supplements the estate tax by imposing a tax on any direct and indirect transfer of property by gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.857" offset="531312">The question presented in this case is whether Mrs. Irvine's 1979 disclaimer of five-sixteenths of her interest in the trust represents a gratuitous transfer of property to which the gift tax applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.284" offset="588991">Many of the issues presented in this case have already been resolved by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.080" offset="608217">Since 1943, in Smith v. Shaughnessy, it has been established that a remainder interest in a trust is a form of property, to which the gift tax applies, and the fact that the remainder interest is subject to defeasance goes only to the value of that interest and not to its character as property.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.311" offset="685121">The only other question posed by the statute is whether the disclaimer of such an interest in property represents a transfer of that property for purposes of the gift tax, and in 1982, in Jewett v. Commissioner, this Court held that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.261" offset="752935">The Court accepted the interpretation of the Commissioner that a disclaimer that is not made within a reasonable time after the taxpayer learns of his interest in the property is an indirect transfer of property to which the gift tax applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.071" offset="812181">The Court explained that the passage of time is crucial to the gift tax scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.417" offset="833497">With the passage of time, the taxpayer can decide whether to retain the property for himself or allow it to pass to the next generation.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.352" offset="865262">The analysis of the Court in Jewett obviously applies directly to Mrs. Irvine's long-delayed disclaimer in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.175" offset="896609">The court of appeals concluded, however, that the gift tax does not apply to this 1979 disclaimer solely because the interest that was disclaimed was created in 1917, before the gift tax was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.846" offset="959303">The Court's analysis ultimately rests upon its acceptance of a legal fiction.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="212.561" offset="986156">What section are we talking about here, Mr. Jones?</text>

            <label>Mr. Kent L. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="226.399" offset="1041432">The section of the code that is relevant would be section 2511, but I think that the answer to your question is that in the enactment of the Federal gift tax there was a provision that says that this statute will not apply to any transfer prior to the date of enactment, and so it was that retroactive... it was that feature of the statute that the court had in mind.</text>

            <text syncTime="252.657" offset="1146548">Well, the Eighth Circuit also relied on one section or subsection that talked about something being a taxable transfer, didn't it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Kent L. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="265.976" offset="1199734">At this point, what I'm pointing out is that the court's analysis ultimately rests upon its acceptance of a legal fiction about disclaimers.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.961" offset="1239753">Under State law, a valid disclaimer is treated as if it were made ab initio, at the same time that the initial transfer was made, and that State legal fiction is designed to protect the property from the intervening claims of creditors and other third parties, but in Jewett the court explained that those State law concerns do not control application of the Federal gift tax, and that's because the State legal fiction is counterfactual.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.741" offset="1358872">It is only a fiction and not a fact that a long-delayed disclaimer is made ab initio.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.954" offset="1383636">In this case, for example, Mrs. Irvine's disclaimer was made 62 years after the trust was formed and a full half-century after she reached her age of majority.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="322.473" offset="1425745">But under State law principles, it would be treated as having occurred back in 1917?</text>

          <turn speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="330.808" stopTime="338.773">
            <label>Mr. Kent L. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="330.808" offset="1459077">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.419" offset="1465556">Under State law principles, the State deems the disclaimer to have been made ab initio.</text>

            <text syncTime="338.773" offset="1490947">And in Jewett, did this Court indicate, the majority, that State law supplies the answer in cases before the promulgation of the 1958 regulation?</text>

            <text syncTime="350.450" offset="1537654">No, to the contrary, the Court held in Jewett that a disclaimer represents an indirect transfer and then looked to the regulation to determine the limitations on that analysis that the Secretary had reached in issuing the interpretive regulation that was in effect at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="370.235" offset="1616857">Do you take the position that in light of Jewett there is no way that the court of appeals judgment here can be affirmed?</text>

            <text syncTime="379.151" offset="1652488">I think Jewett and Jacobs, read together, answer all the questions in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.767" offset="1678924">Jewett answers the question of whether this is an indirect transfer of property by gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.287" offset="1697001">Jacobs and Estate of Sanford answer the question of whether this gift tax is applied retroactively when it's applied to a transfer that occurs after the date of enactment but with respect to an interest that was created before the date of enactment, and what the Court squarely held in Jacobs and Estate of Sanford is that the gift tax retroactivity... nonretroactivity requirement has nothing to do with a tax that's imposed on a transfer that occurs after enactment.</text>

            <text syncTime="481.200" offset="2060625">The '86 regulation was made necessary by the enactment of 2518 of the code, which established a fixed 9-month period for tax-free disclaimers of interest created after 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.471" offset="2117781">In adopting the regulations in 1986, under... to implement the old and the new statutory provisions, the '86 Treasury gift tax regulations used the term, taxable transfer, to describe the initial completed gift.</text>

            <text syncTime="2551.394" offset="10341441">The beneficiary started receiving income in 1936, and 30 years later, in 1966, her brothers died, and she became entitled to an increased income interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.073" offset="10384178">Now, she was aware of that interest from the time that she became a beneficiary of the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.296" offset="10409046">It was a contingent interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2585.026" offset="10476024">As a result of that holding, the Government takes the position that that's what gave rise to the increase in the income, but that really isn't... that isn't any different than if one of those children had died ahead of time, that if it had been a natural child and had died ahead of the brother, we still would have had the situation where there was an increase in income.</text>

            <text syncTime="2646.486" offset="10721784">I just want to emphasize again that it was the Commissioner's interpretation in that case that the taxpayer did not have knowledge, or should not be attributed to have knowledge of that interest until the supreme court of Pennsylvania, after somewhat lengthy litigation, determined that the adopted children could not succeed to the interests of the other affected interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.292" offset="10817079">What is absolutely clear about that ruling is that that was the Commissioner's interpretation, so in stating his interpretation he was plainly being consistent with the analysis of the regulation, which is that a taxpayer has a reasonable time to disclaim after the taxpayer becomes aware of the interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.377" offset="10905373">In brief, a person who transfers property by gift is subject to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.724" offset="10942780">In Estate of Sanford, in 1939, Chief Justice Stone held for the Court that the Federal gift tax looks to the economic realities of the transfer of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.922" offset="10987606">Justice Cardozo said exactly the same thing for the Court in 1933 in Burnet v. Guggenheim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.216" offset="11012684">This Court's decision in Jewett is an amplification of that simple principal, and as I've already described, it is not subject to argument here that the economic realities in this case reflect a lengthy control over the property by Mrs. Irvine and an enjoyment of the income interest, and an ultimate transfer of that property to her children.</text>
