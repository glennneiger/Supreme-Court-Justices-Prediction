            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="91590">I have an opinion to announce on behalf of Justice O'Connor who is also absent today.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.187" offset="116250">This is No.93-445, Beecham and Jones against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.374" offset="153030">This case comes to us on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.034" offset="175704">Petitioners, Beecham and Jones, were convicted of being felons in possession of firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.453" offset="201304">Under the felon in possession law, a person may regain the right to possess firearms if he has had civil rights restored for his conviction, and Beecham and Jones claimed this exemption applied to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.099" offset="259923">But both petitioners had prior federal convictions as well as prior state convictions and their civil rights had been restored only under state law, and for this reason, the Court of Appeals ruled against the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.455" offset="321363">In an opinion filed today, we affirm that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.809" offset="334738">We hold that a civil rights restoration can nullify the affect of a conviction only if it was performed by the convicting jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.834" offset="374862">Petitioner's state civil rights restorations, therefore, cannot undo the disability flowing from their Federal Court convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.812" offset="410806">And this opinion also is unanimous.</text>
