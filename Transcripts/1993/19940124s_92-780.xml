            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="91437">The next case is No. 92-780, the National Organization for Women versus Joseph Scheidler.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.531" offset="121530">The petitioner is the National Organization for Women and others, alleged that the respondents, who are a coalition of anti-abortion groups called "The Pro-Life Action Network" and others, were members of a nationwide conspiracy to shutdown abortion clinics.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.466" offset="193210">The petitioners charged that these respondents conspired to use threatened or actual force, violence or fear to induce clinic employees, doctors, and patients to give up their jobs, their right to practice medicine, and their right to obtain an abortion, all in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, nicknamed for acronym RICO.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.251" offset="300417">The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the dismissal of this action, saying that an economic motive is required in order to bring a legal action like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.560" offset="345661">In the unanimous opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse the Court of Appeals ruling that RICO contains an implicit economic motive requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.203" offset="384217">Nowhere in either Section 1962(c) of the Act or Section 1961's definition of enterprise and pattern or racketeering activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.586" offset="429775">Is there any indication that such an economic requirement is required?</text>
            <text syncTime="89.089" offset="447747">We find that the statutory language is unambiguous and there is no clearly expressed intent of a contrary in the legislative history that would warrant a different construction, nor is there any ambiguity in this language that we have been talking about that would suffice to invoke the rule of lenity, applicable to a criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.942" offset="527159">We, therefore, hold that RICO contains no economic motive requirement, and petitioners may maintain this action if the respondents indeed conducted the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.526" offset="577524">So, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.363" offset="588808">Justice Souter has filed a concurring opinion joined by Justice Kennedy.</text>
