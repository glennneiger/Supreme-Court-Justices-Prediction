            <text syncTime="15.593" offset="238394">Ms. Garvey.</text>

            <text syncTime="17.376" offset="245604">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="21.413" offset="261695">At issue in this case, the Barclays case, is the constitutionality of worldwide combined reporting as applied to a foreign multinational enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.637" offset="310596">The United States and the nations of the world all use one method to divide international income for tax purposes... the arm's length separating accounting method.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.629" offset="358557">That all nations have agreed to use one, and only one method, demonstrates the essential need for uniformity in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.718" offset="394920">For over 20 years, California has defied this international standard by applying a different and inconsistent method... worldwide combined reporting.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.406" offset="437656">Whether or not this method is constitutional as applied to a domestic multinational corporation, it's patently unconstitutional when applied to a foreign-owned corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.047" offset="488229">First, it prevents the Nation from speaking with one voice when regulating foreign commerce, second, it presents a substantial risk of international multiple taxation, and third, as applied by California, it has imposed discriminatory compliance burdens.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.842" offset="563462">Now, the California supreme court circumvented these issues by creating a new test for avoiding dormant Commerce Clause analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.864" offset="599511">Under the California supreme court's test, congressional silence replaces the traditional requirement of affirmative congressional action.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.053" offset="636291">California's approach has no basis in Wardair or in any other case of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.207" offset="660846">Wardair looked at the negative implications from congressional enactment, not negative implications for no enactment at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.015" offset="704105">The California method is practically unworkable as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.669" offset="730750">It is difficult enough to ascertain a congressional meaning from an act of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.156" offset="756663">Gleaning congressional meaning from congressional inaction is impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.726" offset="774949">The United States-United Kingdom treaty is a good illustration of the difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.963" offset="795951">The treaty, as finally ratified, contained no mention of State use of worldwide combined reporting.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.534" offset="830224">From the text, it is not possible to discern any senatorial preference or dislike for the use of worldwide combined reporting.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.842" offset="867422">Now, the legislative history of the courts that go to that, because for some reason to text is ambiguous, indicates a Senate preference for barring the States' use of worldwide combined reporting rather than any affirmative congressional policy to permit the States to use that method.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="191.403" offset="941715">But a preference not strong enough to be reflected in the Senate's exercise of its power, because it didn't have enough votes for the supermajority necessary.</text>

            <label>Ms. Joanne M. Garvey</label>
            <text syncTime="200.076" offset="976405">That is correct, and as a result, Justice Rehnquist, this does not reflect any policy sufficient to take the case out of dormant Commerce Clause analysis, which is the State's argument, and moreover, at least some of the supporters of the reservation were concerned about the use of the treaty method rather than with any restriction on worldwide combined reporting to... by the States as such, and in fact, both of the contracting parties, the United States and the United Kingdom, have made it clear in the past and before this Court that they do not think the treaty reserves the issue, so--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="233.797" offset="1111302">Nonetheless, it is clear from the history that you recited that Congress was certainly well aware of this problem and this debate, and did nothing.</text>

            <label>Ms. Joanne M. Garvey</label>
            <text syncTime="244.771" offset="1155187">--Senatorial awareness, of course... because I don't think both Houses of Congress had addressed the issue... senatorial awareness is not a substitution for this Court's off-affirmed principle that Congress must act affirmatively to remove the State act from scrutiny by this Court under the dormant Commerce Clause, and in fact, at best, the treaty situation is much like a filibuster in which the majority wasn't sufficient to break the filibuster over a particular provision, and so you had to delete that provision to move the rest of the legislation forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.076" offset="1288412">That deletion would not, certainly, indicate congressional policy in favor of the opposite of the deleted provision.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="284.646" offset="1314639">There was in the Wardair case, as you mentioned, the use of the words, affirmatively acted, but the affirmative action was by nonaction, right, by failure to forbid the State taxes?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joanne_m_garvey" startTime="296.954" stopTime="489.698">
            <label>Ms. Joanne M. Garvey</label>
            <text syncTime="296.954" offset="1363854">Yes, but you had a prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.990" offset="1372004">Actually, you did have an action which was a direct prohibition on the use of a portion of State taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.909" offset="1399694">The Chicago convention contained an enactment in which aviation fuel on... State tax on aviation fuel on inbound flights was specifically prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.701" offset="1446818">There was no mention in the text of that enactment, signed by 156 other nations, of anything to do with State tax on outgoing flights.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.307" offset="1481300">From that, plus the fact that the Court had the Federal Aviation Act, which extensively had legislated in the area of domestic aviation and would specifically permit this tax, this Court could start with a text from which to discern congressional policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.601" offset="1554443">In this case, we still have no text.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.922" offset="1567713">Congress has not acted here, and this case should be analyzed under the dormant Commerce Clause, and this case presents a textbook example of a State tax that's violative of the dormant Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.563" offset="1618286">Japan Line and Container provide the framework here for analysis, and the result falls on the Japan Line side of the leger.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.669" offset="1658724">The dispositive factor is that Barclays is foreign.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.323" offset="1677323">There are direct implications on United States foreign policy that were not present in Container, where a domestic enterprise was affected by a domestic tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.630" offset="1722567">Barclays should prevail under this Court's jurisprudence for at least four reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.201" offset="1748898">First, the clearest evidence of implication on United States foreign policy, lacking in Container, is present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.390" offset="1785574">Foreign nations are offended by the use of the California method.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.377" offset="1805532">Their offense has led to retaliatory acts, and foreign nations have a long-recognized and proper interest in the well-being of their nationals and protection of their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.602" offset="1850462">The United States has acknowledged the validity of foreign reactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.887" offset="1867599">The second reason, even if the objective evidence of foreign policy implications were not present, application of the Container objective factors demonstrates that in the circumstances present here, foreign offense is inevitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.098" offset="1940428">First of all, foreign multinationals are exposed to a greater risk of double tax because, typically, more of their operations are in jurisdictions which have the primary right to tax that income that California includes in its tax base, and second, a foreign Government's own interests are affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.381" offset="2033633">Under the international practice, the home nation has the obligation to relieve double tax, and if a foreign nation has to relieve excess tax from the California system, the nation then has the Hobson's choice of relieving the tax and affecting its own revenues, or making its businesses less competitive by not relieving the tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="2159.720" offset="8814916">With respect to the Solicitor General's suggestion that it is not present policy which controls, and instead it is only some historical policy, the impact of a tax on foreign commerce is certainly not felt at the time a tax is accrued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.281" offset="8885238">It is, indeed, when a tax is collected and levied that the impact in international trade is felt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.287" offset="8913241">In Colgate's case, the tax is not collected or anywhere close to collected in 1970 to 1973, the year that the tax accrues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.191" offset="8944797">California must first determine under State law administratively whether it wishes to apply that method to Colgate, and indeed, the tax is ultimately paid in 1982, and the final administrative action that California takes is its denial of Colgate's claim for refund in 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.902" offset="9015641">That is the action that causes the interference with international trade, and that is the action which Colgate is here contesting today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.726" offset="9054929">As a result, it is certainly not some historical inquiry that the Court should be undertaking, and in addition, there certainly is no precedent in this Court's decision for such an approach.</text>

I can't do anything to fix it today... would simply gut the notion of executive... any executive authority in the area of foreign policy and foreign commerce, and if there are no further questions, I would like to reserve the rest of my time for Ms. Garvey's rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2646.868" offset="10763547">If one focuses on those tax years, as I've indicated, we see a preference but not a policy, a willingness on the part of the executive branch to allow States, except in the context of the U.K. U.S. tax convention originally, to tax foreign nationals using the worldwide combined reporting method, and therefore we think that that is the correct representation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2905.221" offset="11796951">First, that the Constitution gives the power to regulate commerce to Congress, not to executive branch letters or policy statements or anything of the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.843" offset="11839478">And second, that there must be a clear line of demarcation maintained between a dormant Commerce Clause analysis and a nondormant Commerce Clause analysis, and confusion results from the taxpayers' brief in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.169" offset="11892768">Well, what is dormant?</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.069" offset="11896320">Well, just a grizzly bear is dormant when it's hibernating, Congress is dormant as to a Commerce Clause issue when it is not making decisions on that issue informing United States law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.727" offset="11942923">What is not dormant?</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.346" offset="11949401">Well, if the bear's out of the den, down at the stream choosing which fish to swat up on the shore and which fish to let go by, that bear is not dormant as to any of those fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.369" offset="11989525">Similarly, if Congress, informing the commerce law of the United States, is choosing which tax practice to prohibit and which tax practice to let go by, then Congress is not dormant as to any of those tax issues that are under congressional scrutiny.</text>

            <text syncTime="3020.596" offset="12258482">If, indeed, such implied permission exists, then the one voice has spoken through the congressional actions and no dormant Commerce Clause analysis is required or necessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3346.808" offset="13563246">Just as in Wardair, in separate treaties or separate agreements, the States were subjected to certain limitations and not others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.629" offset="13594593">Here we have one document with a synergistic combination of both of the types of implications from Wardair.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.235" offset="13628970">Adding to that, you have the implication of through the history of these bilateral treaties where the international model treaty of the OECD would restrict the States, as well as the national government, to the arms-length approach, thus barring them from using the unitary business approach, particularly as to branches of the corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.552" offset="13734296">In all the treaties, in dozens and dozens... in every United States bilateral income tax treaty through the years, the Federal Government has been subjected to an arms-length limitation and the States have not been subjected to that limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.096" offset="13800438">Certainly, the issue was on the table as to these treaties because there are these model foreign treaties that would have subjected the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.369" offset="13837532">And, in fact, in a considerable number of these treaties which are set forth on page 17 of the Alaska brief in support of our position, there are a significant number of these treaties where the political subdivision of the other States of the other Nation were subjected to this arms-length restriction, and still the States of the United States were not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.568" offset="13938365">So I submit that the indications, certainly in the Wardair treaty with the history, but forget the history, look to the language of the U.S. U.K. treaty and to the other dozens and dozens of United States treaties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.112" offset="14004507">The common feature in all of those... and if this is the international standard, I'm perfectly happy to live with it... is that the national governments are restricted to the use of the arms-length approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.337" offset="14053408">The State governments are not, and thus can use the unitary business approach with its formulary apportionment of income, one form of which is worldwide combined reporting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.062" offset="14096353">So under Wardair, and under the Itel Containers case from 1993, if the standard is put in Itel, the most rational inference to be drawn from the body of law, from the treaties themselves, Federal law, is that the States are impliedly permitted to use worldwide combined reporting.</text>

            <text syncTime="3588.081" offset="14528418">First, I'd point out that this Court, in Container, which is consistent with this Court's doctrine through 70 years of Court procedure, has held that this is a proper and fair method of taxation, that it is a method of taxation that fairly apportions income to the taxing jurisdiction with a reasonable sense of how income is generated, and that... and this is the word from Container... it avoids the basic theoretical weaknesses of arms-length separate accounting, such as giving the taxpayer the chance for manipulations through tax havens and this sort of thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="4445.382" offset="17957565">I mean, the foreign governments simply will not agree with this Court, or let on that they agree that this Court has held that worldwide combined reporting is proper and fair, and that it apportions income in a fair manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4459.392" offset="18013676">As in Allied Signal this Court recognized that it does a better job of apportioning values between parts of a unitary business than arms-length separate accounting does.</text>
            <text syncTime="4468.514" offset="18050142">What you're hearing from the foreign governments is just the same complaints you heard in Container.</text>
            <text syncTime="4475.001" offset="18076056">And it's... I submit that this Court has given the foreign governments a chance to come up with something new and they have not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4482.691" offset="18106880">So... but that, in another context, perhaps foreign governments could provide, and the taxpayers could argue, that there is a true implication of foreign affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4493.047" offset="18148258">Here if the foreign governments were really arguing what their real interests are, what they would be telling this Court is we want California to be bound to the same arms-length approach that the States are... or that the Federal Government is, because the Federal Government cannot possibly administer that tax and our taxpayers can find ways of manipulating their books to get around it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4516.312" offset="18241359">We would be hearing we like to provide tax havens to our taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4521.132" offset="18260585">And so if the California method is taken away... the ability to impose worldwide combined reporting is taken away from the States, we won't have to worry about that anymore and the tax havens can continue to be just as effective as they are with the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4536.909" offset="18323697">No matter how hard the Federal Government tries to enforce arms-length separate accounting, what it is doing is gradually getting as close as possible to a global formulary apportionment of income, as can be done under the treaties that restrict it to arms length.</text>
            <text syncTime="4552.187" offset="18384823">So the Federal... the foreign governments' complaints really are just a rehash of what this Court has already rejected in Container.</text>
            <text syncTime="4560.107" offset="18416484">And the United Kingdom, of course, has put a retaliatory statute on its books, and it will brandish that statute for dramatic effect whenever it feels that it's appropriate, and yet it hasn't ever implemented that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4577.219" offset="18484925">And, of course, the reason is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="4579.885" offset="18495582">The Federal Government has testified before Congress that implementation of that statute by the United Kingdom would be a direct violation of the U.S. U.K. treaty which the U.K. bargained for and signed onto knowing that it had been unsuccessful in its attempts to have the States barred from using worldwide combined reporting.</text>
            <text syncTime="4601.750" offset="18583040">I'd like to point out that as to our arguments on the executive branch... excuse me, as to... back now to the nondormant side, the executive branch actions have confirmed that Congress has acquiesced in the States' use of worldwide combined reporting.</text>
            <text syncTime="4623.331" offset="18669349">No matter what their statements might be... they might well be jawboning as the Solicitor General says... they executive branch's actual statements... or, excuse me, actual actions show... like when they drafted their own model income tax treaty, they made it very clear that the national government would be subjected to the arms-length restrictions, but the States would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4647.613" offset="18766525">When the foreign model treaties are drafted by the OECD, why the Federal Government... the executive branch has entered formal reservations to those treaties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4658.754" offset="18811037">When after the U.S. U.K. treaty, the other foreign governments wanted the executive branch to negotiate the same sort of ban on the States' use of worldwide combined reporting as it had in the U.S. U.K. treaty, the executive branch pointed to the actions of the Senate and said, no, we will not do that; it would not be successful in the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4680.518" offset="18898182">The executive branch, when it has wanted to change the States' use of worldwide combined reporting, has not tried to issue its own Federal... clear Federal directive prohibiting the States' use.</text>
            <text syncTime="4693.677" offset="18950740">It has, instead, gone to Congress and asked for Congress to change the rule as it applies now permitting the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4700.931" offset="18979788">The issue has been fought through in the U.S. U.K. treaty and the issue has been on the table in dozens and dozens of other income tax treaties, bilateral treaties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4713.841" offset="19031406">The State of California, by using worldwide combined reporting, is only doing what these treaties permit the States to do, and nothing that the executive branch or the foreign governments or the taxpayers can say or do can negate this congressional acquiescence in the State tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="4733.152" offset="19108624">I might point out that the 1993 California legislation, as the Solicitor General pointed out, is the culmination of a campaign by the executive branch for the States to adopt a compromise solution, the water's edge approach, which contains both worldwide combined reporting elements and separate accounting elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4756.085" offset="19200366">And since that tax law has been inserted in 1993, which amended a 1986 statute, the United Kingdom has withdrawn its threats of retaliation for the moment and has recognized... at least impliedly recognized that such retaliation would not be justifiable at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4779.283" offset="19293153">So in the dormant Commerce Clause context--</text>

            <text syncTime="4835.703" offset="19518851">Thank you, Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4836.703" offset="19522926">United States has sought, from the very beginning, to resolve this problem of States' use of an inconsistent method in only one way; have the States' respect the international practice by receding to a tax base that is confined to the United States tax jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4860.068" offset="19616340">And so the United States has appeared six times in this case, four times in support of Barclays, beginning in the California trial court, and now twice on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="4871.460" offset="19661898">But even though the current administration now supports California, its position, as explicated by the Solicitor General and in its briefs, actually continues to underscore the reasons why this Court should rule in Barclays favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4885.184" offset="19716755">First, the current administration did not support California until California changed its law to bring it into ostensible conformity with international practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4895.991" offset="19760014">And, in fact, as the California legislative committee reports acknowledge, the change in the law was requested by the administration to avoid retaliation, which shows the clear causal connection between utilization of this State tax to divide international income and the problems and the implications on United States foreign policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4917.072" offset="19844337">And the Solicitor General also mentioned, but the brief clearly brings out, that the United States continues to supports Barclays on very significant points.</text>
            <text syncTime="4926.678" offset="19882789">California's Wardair analysis is inapplicable in the eyes of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4932.081" offset="19904418">And, second, under the applicable dormant Commerce Clause analysis, worldwide combined reporting is unconstitutional when it is incompatible with the international practice, and it is incompatible.</text>
            <text syncTime="4943.972" offset="19951961">So when all is said and done, the current administration's difference with Barclays is a tiny issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4951.495" offset="19982054">Now, they say there were not sufficiently clear Federal executive pronouncements to make the tax unconstitutional by the year of tax accrual, which is actually 1978.</text>
