            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="148679">We'll hear argument next in Number 92-2058, Hawaiian Airlines v. Grant Norris.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.635" offset="303219">Mr. Hipp.</text>

          <turn speaker="kenneth_b_hipp" startTime="70.408" stopTime="201.224">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth B. Hipp</label>
            <text syncTime="70.408" offset="430279">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="73.938" offset="444385">This case is about the scope of the minor dispute resolution procedure of the Railway Labor Act, and whether an airline employee can abandon that procedure and go to State court with a State tort claim of wrongful discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.109" offset="501019">This Court has repeatedly recognized that Congress, in establishing the Railway Labor Act, set up a comprehensive, indeed, pioneering alternative dispute resolution procedure for adjusting minor disputes between employees and employers without lawsuits and without strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.412" offset="582312">Furthermore, as all the parties in this case accept, the minor dispute resolution procedure within the Railway Labor Act, section 204, must go through the mandatory arbitration procedures of the adjustment board in the absence of concurrent jurisdiction pursuant to congressional act.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.036" offset="668725">Where we part company with the Hawaii court, with the respondent, and with the Solicitor General is in defining the scope of the jurisdictional language of section 204.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.502" offset="706655">In our view, and as we have argued at length in our brief, our opponent's positions concerning the scope of section 204 are flawed because they attempt to rewrite the plain language of section 204 and other provisions of the Railway Labor Act, and they misconstrue the Railway Labor Act's legislative history and this Court's decisions interpreting the RLA.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.435" offset="782410">If this Court were to accept our opponent's views, the result would greatly undermine Congress' scheme for resolving employment disputes, and it would do that by undercutting the historic legislative tradeoff that took place in 1934, whereby unions and employees achieved the mandatory arbitration procedures of the Railway Labor Act in return for giving up their right to go to court and their right to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.602" offset="895050">As this Court recognized in the Chicago River and Indiana Railroad case, that tradeoff was fundamental to the 1934 amendments to the RLA prior to the enactment in 1936 of section 204.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="201.224" offset="953564">Mr. Hipp, you seem to be arguing for a different standard under the RLA than that under Lingle and under the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.252" offset="993583">I'm not sure... how do you justify application of such a different standard?</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth B. Hipp</label>
            <text syncTime="216.965" offset="1016467">Your Honor, the touchstone for preemption, as in fact the Court recognized in Lingle, is not to apply some procrustean approach, but instead to look at the purposes of Congress in each scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.983" offset="1072578">What was the purpose of Congress in section 301?</text>
            <text syncTime="234.666" offset="1087311">The purpose of Congress was to assure common interpretation of collective bargaining agreements pursuant to Federal common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.003" offset="1124614">There's no mention of alternative dispute resolution there.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.955" offset="1136421">There's no mention of any arbitral forum there.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.278" offset="1145721">What is the purpose of the Railway Labor Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="252.929" offset="1160349">The purpose of the Railway Labor Act is to provide a method, a comprehensive method for resolving disputes between employers and employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.099" offset="1205071">If you look at section 2 First of the Railway Labor act, Congress has made the determination that it is these kinds of disputes between employers and employees that leads to disruption of interstate commerce, therefore Congress set up, in section 3 First (i) for the railroad industry and in section 204 for the airline industry, a method for resolving those disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.104" offset="1300992">The method is an arbitral or adjustment board method, and a scope of jurisdiction is stated there.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.000" offset="1324607">It is a congressional scope of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.354" offset="1334011">Therefore, unlike Lingle, which addresses Congress' concerns related to interpretation of the collective bargaining agreements, Congress had a different agenda in 204 and 3 First (i).</text>

            <text syncTime="307.634" offset="1379151">But I suppose Congress didn't intend to entirely preempt ordinary State laws, even in the transportation industry, having... I guess we've upheld State requirements that the train have a caboose, and one thing and another, and so obviously we have said there is room for application of State law--</text>

            <text syncTime="335.871" offset="1492104">That's correct, Your Honor, and that is because you must address the congressional purposes of the RLA.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.426" offset="1518331">The RLA was designed to deal with disputes between employees and employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.368" offset="1538080">It was not designed to deal with whether or not a State established a minimum substantive standard such as a caboose.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.263" offset="1565665">If you have a regulatory agency in a State that says... and the State makes the determination through its legislative process that State may have a caboose law, it doesn't have anything to do with the Railway Labor Act.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="366.121" offset="1613103">Well, the State perhaps could arguably have made a conscious decision, by the passage of whistleblower statutes, that this is a means of assuring public safety.</text>

            <text syncTime="377.898" offset="1660228">They can make that determination, but what they cannot do, Your Honor... and this is what the Andrews case in essence holds... is that they cannot take a dispute between an employee and an employer in the airline or railroad industry and convert that dispute into a State law claim, taking it out of the adjustment board process.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.831" offset="1743925">Why not?</text>
            <text syncTime="399.593" offset="1746955">Why can't they do that?</text>

            <text syncTime="1817.774" offset="7419706">Only by ignoring decades of law can petitioners argue that the RLA wipes out or forces into an RLA forum these minimum protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.915" offset="7488251">Beginning more than 60 years ago, this Court has had opportunities in which it could have held that the RLA governs such independent laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="1955.208" offset="7969427">That is, that these kinds of independent claims are funneled into the RLA forum.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard H. Seamon</label>
            <text syncTime="2898.295" offset="11741822">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.034" offset="11808800">I would like to begin by addressing some of the issues that came up earlier in the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.847" offset="11828026">First, we would part company with our colleagues on the issue of preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.782" offset="11847775">We would say that when a factual issue is arbitrated and goes through to an award, that under Utah Mining and similar precedent the normal rules of administrative res judicata would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.001" offset="11904617">The second point I would like to make is related to that, which is, we believe that what an arbitrator, or what the National Railroad Adjustment Board can decide under the RLA are grievances, and we believe that the term grievances, by and large, includes claims based on the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.901" offset="11980268">Now, to the extent the collective bargaining agreement actually incorporates State law, then it may well be that the arbitrator can look to State law, but his or her authority to do so is solely bounded by the terms of the contract, and that is because, again, the term grievances really embraces claims based on the employment contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.008" offset="12068666">The third point I would like to make has to do with the hypothetical that arose with respect to whether a State could effectively enact a comprehensive labor code that would address virtually all of the subjects that would be covered under a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.106" offset="12133032">We think the answer to that to a large extent depends on whether the State was attempting to regulate the collective bargaining process on the one hand, in which case we think that it would severely limited by doing so, because that is what the RLA deals with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.708" offset="12195412">That's on the one hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.522" offset="12206697">The other hand is that a State still remains free to govern... to regulate about substantive matters of employee safety, to set minimal standards of protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.670" offset="12247343">Again, one of the points that Ms. Mollway made, and this Court has made, is that the RLA governs the process for arriving at an agreement rather than the substantive terms that end up in the agreement that's--</text>

            <text syncTime="3040.710" offset="12311500">Well, all terms of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.070" offset="12312859">You're saying that States can control the mandatory terms of an employment agreement under the RLA.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard H. Seamon</label>
            <text syncTime="3048.186" offset="12341384">There may be other Federal statutes and Supremacy Clause problems at the margins, but as far as the RLA is concerned, the answer is yes, substantive matters such as wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.833" offset="12379941">The next point is also related to the question about what a State can regulate without running afoul of the RLA and the process for arbitrating minor grievances, and that is that our opponents try to make a distinction between disputes that arise in the employment setting and safety issues, but in fact the two are often related.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.560" offset="12486834">In the caboose case, for example, the whole dispute began when employees of a railroad sought to have cabooses added to trains, even though the collective bargaining agreement in that case didn't provide for the cabooses that the State law provided for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.622" offset="12551095">In other words, that was a dispute, but it was also a safety issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.405" offset="12566246">In that case, the State had determined that there were a minimal number of cabooses that had to be added to trains even though the collective bargaining agreement in that case provided for a fewer number, so in reality the distinction that our opponents try to draw between safety matters on the one hand and employment disputes on the other hand doesn't really exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.770" offset="12647748">And the last point I'd like to make with respect to issues that arose prior in the argument has to do with the Seventh Amendment, and we would say that ultimately we don't know the answer to the question of whether the Seventh Amendment applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.300" offset="12705845">We think the difficulty of making a Seventh Amendment argument with respect to our colleagues is that this Court has never held that the Seventh Amendment applies to actions in the State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.978" offset="12748581">It only applies to Federal court actions, and for that reason we doubt that a serious Seventh Amendment problem was raised here.</text>
