            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="91647">The second of the two cases I have to announce is Digital Equipment versus Desktop Direct, No. 93-405.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.687" offset="130308">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.375" offset="145146">In 1991, the petitioner in this case, Digital Equipment Corporation, began to market a service it called Desktop Direct from Digital.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.031" offset="183703">The respondent, Desktop Direct, which is like petitioners in the computer business brought suit in Federal District Court claiming that Digital was infringing its trade name.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.318" offset="224871">The parties then reached a confidential settlement agreement and, in accordance with its terms, Desktop dismissed its suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.329" offset="252875">Several months later, Desktop asked the District Court to vacate its dismissal order and rescind the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.324" offset="276907">Desktop contended that Digital had misrepresented material facts in the course of settlement negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.375" offset="301045">The court granted Desktop's motion and when Digital sought an immediate appeal under 28 U.S. Code 1291, the Court of Appeals dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.269" offset="344721">This case requires us to decide whether an order denying effect to a privately negotiated settlement agreement qualified such an immediately appealable collateral order as to allow appeal as requested by the petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.039" offset="411699">We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit that it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.487" offset="429567">In arguing that Section 1291 confers appellate jurisdiction, Digital relies on cases holding a party entitled to immediate appeal of the decision denying certain claimed rights not to stand trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.130" offset="480140">We have previously held, for example, that a criminal defendant may take an immediate appeal from a District Court order denying a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds, and that a government official claiming immunity from suit also may appeal an address decision on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.784" offset="542729">Our reasoning in each instance was similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.227" offset="552551">The right not to stand trial could not be vindicated if the party claiming it was forced to endure a full trial before taking an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.165" offset="584212">Digital claims that this case is indistinguishable and that its settlement agreement with Desktop gave it a freedom from suit no different from and no less than need of prompt vindication then those of criminal and governmental defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.435" offset="645338">But, we detect two telling differences: First, even if Desktop has given Digital the sort of immunity claimed, a point which Desktop by no means concedes, this sort of privately granted right cannot displace the strong statutory presumption against piecemeal appeals in the same manner as immunity is rooted in the Constitution or statute have been held to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.730" offset="738543">Secondly, such private rights can be vindicated using other less disruptive means such as State Court contract actions to an extent that public law immunities may not.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.805" offset="782847">Finally, claims of freedom from trial by private agreement are not significantly distinguishable from many others such as assertions that an appellant's action is barred by res judicata or limitation statute which have been held not to be appealable immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.725" offset="842511">To find jurisdiction only over appeals like Digital's would thus be arbitrary, but to allow these other comparable sorts to be entertained routinely would badly erode the safeguard against piecemeal litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.900" offset="891203">Our opinion in this case is unanimous.</text>
