            <text syncTime="180.779" offset="858245">Either way, it's an unreliable verdict, because it was based on an arbitrary factor rather than a determination that death was appropriate for this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.993" offset="887085">Although the jury was not explicitly told in this case that their decision did not matter, that message was clearly communicated by the piece of evidence that showed that he had already been sentenced to die.</text>

            <text syncTime="2172.489" offset="8825070">I would also like to remind you that in this particular case, I realize that what we're primarily concerned with is setting down guidelines or determining for future cases what the effect of this evidence is, or if this evidence should be admitted at all, but in this case, the Court of Criminal Appeals had to engage in a reweighing analysis because the prior violent felony conviction aggravating circumstance fell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.078" offset="8935411">They then considered, as this Court has held that they may, the remaining aggravating circumstances, and considered all the mitigating evidence that was presented on behalf of the defendant and held that the best sentence was still the appropriate sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.057" offset="8995388">Their decision is on page 66 of the Joint Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.362" offset="9012525">So certainly in this case there's absolutely no question that that judgment and sentence that reflected that the defendant already had a death sentence could have affected his verdict, could have affected the sentence of death in this case at all, based on what the Court of Criminal Appeals had to do.</text>
