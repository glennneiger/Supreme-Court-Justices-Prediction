            <text syncTime="981.197" offset="4074594">But to the extent that the Court finds difficulty with that, we think that there is one inference that certainly can be drawn from that language and structure analysis, and that is that Congress intended that at least some of the provisions of the 1991 act would have applicability to pending cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.621" offset="4164246">In other words, the language points in the direction of some applicability to pending cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.043" offset="4185980">What that directive provides is an invitation for courts to evaluate the remaining provisions of the act against a backdrop of jurisprudence having to do with default rules in those instances where it is not clear whether certain provisions should be applied to pending cases or not to pending cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2353.564" offset="9564070">In fact, there were... the preliminary bills for the Civil Rights Act of 1991 used identical language to that: to respond to Supreme Court decisions rendered under title VII and to restore the law to what it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.753" offset="9616837">And if one reads the legislative history, for whatever it's worth, it does account for some history, and here there was a bitter struggle between the Bush administration and the Democratic leaders in the Senate and in the House over whether or not changes in the law to which they agreed should be characterized as restorative or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.364" offset="9687264">But the other point I'd make to you, Justice Stevens, is it's really not a determinative factor what a law is characterized as.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.788" offset="9716939">The question should be whether or not Congress has commanded that even a restorative law be applied retroactively or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.053" offset="9742016">It may be that restorative laws are those kinds of laws in which Congress is going to be more likely on occasion to make those... to meet this Court's test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.400" offset="9775453">But there's no reason to lower the standard just because Congress may on those occasions rise up and say notwithstanding the fundamental principles of justice that underlie the traditional presumption, notwithstanding our historic suspicion of legislatures enacting retroactive rules, that these are occasions on which other values, values that our society has now come to agreement upon, should override the presumption in those particular circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="2806.360" offset="11375192">As the Justices pointed out, the judgment entered in the Landgraf case was a take-nothing judgment against the plaintiff.</text>

            <text syncTime="2827.835" offset="11461187">So that, in fact, the remedy that the 1964 Congress wanted happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.777" offset="11480935">The 1964 Congress, in contrast to the 1991 Congress, wanted to encourage employers to fix the situations themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.093" offset="11510193">And this employer did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.733" offset="11516775">Maybe not as fast as we would have liked, and maybe the next time it'll do it better.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.656" offset="11536420">And one of the... no doubt one of the effects of the 1991 statute... because I now have clients calling me asking me to put on sexual harassment training seminars that weren't... we didn't use to put on for our clients, is for them to increase their training efforts, increase their monitoring efforts, increase their education efforts so that they can train their employees both not to discriminate on the basis of race or sex, not to have sexually harassment work forces, to respond effectively to employee complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.435" offset="11655538">But please do remember that the employers in this case, A, have not been adjudicated of violating any law, discriminating unlawfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.822" offset="11693050">And, in fact, it's always... not always, but in these two cases, as it is in many cases, these are cases in which the employers are simply being held vicariously liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.750" offset="11732756">And there is no doubt that the 1964 Congress understood and the 1991 Congress understood that the level of the sanctions that are attached to the law informed the judgments made by American employers as to how much money to put into the investment to ensure that other people don't discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.227" offset="11794718">Discrimination is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.579" offset="11800152">It's illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.450" offset="11803600">When it's found to have occurred... as it has not been, there's no judgment finding any discrimination in either of these cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2932.733" offset="11880713">I'd like... one final point to make to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.527" offset="11911956">This was a political compromise, as Justice Scalia pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.281" offset="11926898">This was not an issue that slipped through.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.831" offset="11937138">This was vigorously debated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.104" offset="11946229">And there wouldn't have been a Civil Rights Act but for the fact that Senator Danforth and Senator Rudman and Senator Domenici and six other moderate Republicans said if we're going to have a civil rights bill, people are going to have to make some compromises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.170" offset="11994503">And they forged a compromise and they ended up with ambiguous statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.884" offset="12013311">And they ended up stitching together a few bills that, as Justice Ginsburg has pointed out, contain redundancies that we can't get out of the statute any way we read it, no matter what presumptions we apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.901" offset="12049360">And we had a lot of self-serving floor statements.</text>

            <text syncTime="3067.061" offset="12418000">Mr. Nager was correct when he stated that the district court found that the plaintiff's personnel manager had corrected... had addressed the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.565" offset="12456034">However, the record also demonstrates, and the Court found, that that happened only after more than a year of particularly egregious harassment, during which time the victim repeatedly went to her supervisor who responded to her that she was a tattletale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.166" offset="12510473">And she was thereafter threatened on a number of occasions for having complained.</text>
