            <text syncTime="16.753" offset="217931">This case comes before the Court on a writ of certiorari from the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.357" offset="244367">There, the Eleventh Circuit held that recusal motions of Federal judges under 28 United States Code section 455(a) have to be considered with the extrajudicial source requirement and therefore the arguments concerning a judge's conduct in the courtroom were improper and they did not need to be considered in terms of such a motion, and therefore affirmed the conviction of my three clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.138" offset="379472">In 1983, by way of background as to these convictions and to this motion to recuse, Father Bourgeois, Father Rosebaugh, and Ms. Ventimiglia were arrested and convicted in Georgia of various petty misdemeanors before the Honorable J. Robert Elliott in the Middle District of Georgia.</text>

            <text syncTime="91.313" offset="516145">So because they were petty misdemeanors, Chief Justice, it was a bench trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.498" offset="544880">That bench trial obviously generated a transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.738" offset="557836">There were sentences.</text>

            <text syncTime="106.413" offset="576540">In 1991, Father Bourgeois, Charles Liteky and Pat Liteky were charged again with regard to activities on the Fort Benning military base, this time with a felony, and as a result of that indictment were brought before Judge Elliott, the same judge who had presided at the 1983 case, and filed a motion to recuse Judge Elliott based largely, in fact almost exclusively, on his conduct in the 1983 case and attached as part of that motion not only argument but a transcript of the 1983 proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.791" offset="738081">Judge Elliott denied the motion, rejected the motion, citing the leading Fifth Circuit and Eleventh Circuit cases which have an extrajudicial source requirement for 455 Federal recusal motions and indicated because the events that were alleged requiring the recusal arose in the courtroom, that is, part of the judicial proceedings, that judicial conduct need not be considered under 455(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="176.700" offset="857722">The Eleventh Circuit, as I held... as I indicated affirmed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.814" offset="886143">After the recusal motion was denied, there was another trial in 1991, this time with a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.999" offset="906937">It was a day-and-a-half trial, and that resulted in convictions and sentences of the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="227.478" offset="1060850">Well, in allowing a litigant to rely on conduct in a prior trial when that judgment wasn't appealed, allow that many years later to come up in the guise of a recusal motion, is... perhaps that's the reason why courts have said they're not going to entertain what might be regarded as a substitute for an appeal in this form.</text>

            <text syncTime="258.629" offset="1185402">--Your Honor, I don't think that would be a substitute for the appeal because it would be governed by substantially different standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.904" offset="1210480">That is, if there had been a direct appeal to the Eleventh Circuit in 1983 on fair trail grounds, it would be judged by abuse of discretion, whereas that appeal conceivably and academically could be lost, and it could still arise under 455(a) to a possibility or a reasonable doubt as to partiality under that statute and require recusal, even though there had been an affirmance in 1983, so I don't think those are exact comparable issues.</text>
