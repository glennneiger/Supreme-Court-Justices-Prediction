            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="149989">We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 92-1956, Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Gottshall and Carlisle.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.590" offset="204324">Mr. Wellington.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ralph_g_wellington" startTime="14.930" stopTime="173.907">
            <label>Mr. Ralph G. Wellington</label>
            <text syncTime="14.930" offset="209653">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.973" offset="221878">These two consolidated cases from the Third Circuit arise from different factual circumstances, but present a single fundamental issue from their holdings: Do railroads have a broad duty, under the Federal Employers Liability Act, to protect their employees from all genuine and foreseeable emotional harm, even in the absence of physical impact or reasonable fear of physical impact?</text>
            <text syncTime="38.838" offset="305261">This Court, in 1987, in its decision in the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe v. Buell case, discussed but did not decide whether claims for emotional injury were cognizable under the FELA.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.437" offset="359700">And since that time, Federal and State courts around the country have wrestled with that fundamental question, and with the legal principles to be applied in answering it.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.073" offset="394182">Although different analyses have been applied by different courts, most... indeed, all, so far, until the Third Circuit, have recognized the need to have reasonable limits on recovery for such claims of emotional distress.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.170" offset="450606">Only the Third Circuit, in the decisions below, has expressly rejected the experience of the common law and the limited tests of duty developed at common law with respect to emotional harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.138" offset="490521">And in its Gottshall decision, the court determined that the duty of railroads under the FELA, and I quote only a phrase from the appendix, page 52 of the writ... appendix to the writ of certiorari, they held that the duty under the FELA, quote, includes a duty to guard against conditions in the work place that cause emotional harm to employees, end quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.612" offset="580382">This duty was then applied in the Carlisle decision to hold for the first time that railroads can be subjected to damages under the FELA for general work place stress.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.428" offset="623641">We believe those decisions to be error.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.891" offset="637538">At the outset, I wish to make Conrail's position on the issue clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.085" offset="654257">We do not dispute that under some circumstances the FELA may provide recovery for some claims of emotional distress.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.020" offset="686022">In short, we do not argue that the word "injury" in the statute precludes recovery for all emotional harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.005" offset="713920">Rather, we believe the critical inquiry is whether negligence in the statute imposes a general duty to guard against conditions in the work place that cause emotional harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.999" offset="753940">Since there was no independent duty for... at common law at the time the FELA was enacted to avoid negligent infliction of emotional distress, and since there is no evidence that Congress intended to include in the FELA a duty under negligence that was not included at common law at the time, we believe that no such general duty exists and should not be imposed by the courts.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="173.907" offset="845578">So, you think the duty to guard against emotional injury is a more limited one than the duty imposed by the Act to guard against physical injury?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ralph_g_wellington" startTime="183.410" stopTime="234.744">
            <label>Mr. Ralph G. Wellington</label>
            <text syncTime="183.410" offset="883612">Yes, Your Honor, we do.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.872" offset="889463">If... if one looks... as this Court recently, in Morgan Monessen, observed, it's important to look at the historical context of the FELA and the legislative history at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.549" offset="932095">And at the time the FELA was enacted in 1908, there was no general duty at common law to avoid the negligent infliction of emotional distress.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.114" offset="966368">Indeed, there is no such general duty today.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.858" offset="977339">What the common law has done in the last 80 years or so is carve out certain limited exceptions, defined by zone of danger test, bystander test, that permit some limited recovery under some circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.495" offset="1027912">And we believe that if one begins with looking at the statute and its historical context, that you cannot assume that Congress, in 1908, included... intended to impose a duty on the railroads that was not then recognized at common law and, indeed--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="234.744" offset="1088934">Well, is it possible, though, that the common law can change over time, and that a duty could evolve, and that perhaps the Act is broad enough to encompass those changing notions?</text>
            <text syncTime="252.697" offset="1160719">Absolut--</text>
            <text syncTime="253.809" offset="1165212">--At least there's some suggestion to that effect, I think, in some of this Court's language.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ralph_g_wellington" startTime="259.613" stopTime="337.392">
            <label>Mr. Ralph G. Wellington</label>
            <text syncTime="259.613" offset="1188409">--Absolutely, Justice O'Connor, that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.124" offset="1198440">And we recognize that this Court has interpreted the statute as evolving with common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.896" offset="1225502">But within the statutory framework originally enacted, for example, in the Urie decision, where this Court real... held that injury in the statute includes injury over time from a deleterious substance, not just impact injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.179" offset="1290704">That's, I think, an appropriate development with common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.740" offset="1308885">But, in Morgan, as the Court indicated, and as we believe here, where there was no... in fact, where the statute could not have included the duty at the outset, and Congress has chosen not to include it through the next 80 years or so, we think it's inappropriate to include a new duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.749" offset="1368967">The Third Circuit's test, in fact, goes beyond, Your Honor, anything that the common law generally recognizes.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.704" offset="1392791">What we are suggesting is that the appropriate test is... does reflect this... a response to the remedial purposes of the FELA.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.623" offset="1436467">And that's the zone of danger test that the common law has wrestled with over several decades.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.254" offset="1454962">And at the same time, in that test, it does permit recovery for certain plaintiffs under certain circumstances, who have sustained an emotional injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.542" offset="1496131">But that--</text>

            <text syncTime="337.392" offset="1499475">Well, certainly these... these particular plaintiffs present rather appealing cases, don't they?</text>

            <text syncTime="343.896" offset="1525493">--I think that the facts, Justice Blackmun, are compelling, particularly, let's say, in the Gottshall case.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.352" offset="1563318">They are dramatized because of the heart attack of a co-worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.916" offset="1577633">The difficulty, I think, with... with the Third Circuit's opinion, is that in dramatizing those facts... and they are sympathetic... I don't take issue with the sympathy of the facts, particularly in the Gottshall case--</text>

            <text syncTime="382.391" offset="1679511">And the real problem is exhibited by its application in Carlisle.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.075" offset="1694244">And it is this general duty that they've assumed that the railroads now have under the FELA.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.617" offset="1716396">Once you apply the duty... take the duty from the facts of Carlisle... excuse me... Gottshall... and apply it to a Carlisle case, where you immediately have a finding that the duty includes a general duty to avoid emotional harm in the work place, you now have the kind of unlimited liability that has never been recognized.</text>

            <text syncTime="419.066" offset="1826214">The District Court, in fact, in Gottshall, in a... in reviewing the summary judgment, analyzed Mr. Gottshall's claim on a traditional zone of danger analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.665" offset="1876578">And it determined that he was not within a zone of danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.067" offset="1890162">In fact, in the Third Circuit, as the record reflects, Mr. Gottshall argued that the zone of danger was the inappropriate test to analyze his claim because he recognizes he's not within the zone of danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.046" offset="1934152">And the Third Circuit did the analysis on the common law bystander test, which some courts recognize.</text>

            <text syncTime="740.418" offset="3111648">But at the time this statute was enacted, and indeed, today, as I... as I've mentioned, there is, at the common law, no general duty to protect against emotional harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.846" offset="3161280">For that duty to have... for us to assume that in 1908 Congress intended that duty, without having reflected that in the statute itself, when the duty didn't exist at common law, or without there being any legislative history that reflects that emotional injuries of this nature were to be covered, I think is... is inappropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="821.703" offset="3436716">And I... I still haven't got a clear fix, because you seem to be backtracking now, on whether you're saying the Third Circuit didn't take the sensible position for a common law court dealing with concepts of negligence and injury to be taking, or there are additional constraints that the FELA places on the Federal courts that would not be placed on, say, the courts of Pennsylvania in determining the extent of liability for infliction of emotional distress.</text>

            <text syncTime="2338.570" offset="9504229">I will frame the issue just a little bit differently, because I think the issue that this Court is presented with here is whether Conrail's distrust of the twin pillars of the American justice system... and that is the jury and the adversarial system... should persuade this Court to ignore the text of the FELA and the broad remedial purposes as... as the commitments of this Court over almost the last century have revealed, to ignore genuine, severe and foreseeable injury resulting from the negligence of the railroad.</text>

Lynn and Massachusetts Railroad, they recognized that there was a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid emotional injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2453.046" offset="9962103">And what the resolution of the issue before this Court is, is really a matter of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.530" offset="9984046">In the Carlisle case, we marshalled a trial, and the jury decided that Conrail ignored the 1929 studies that revealed the dangerous medical consequences, bodily consequences, that... that occurred as a result of unreasonable stress on the job without visual assistance; they ignored the 1974 report of the FRA, which confirmed those results; they ignored the 1987 assessment of the very office that found the conditions there hazardous, that found the staff inadequate, that found the work excessive, that found that there was no visual assistance whatsoever to assist train dispatchers who were making moment-to-moment decisions that could involve wholesale catastrophe.</text>

            <text syncTime="2589.177" offset="10506600">--Judge... Justice, let me please comment on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.691" offset="10524676">Because, actually, if you look at the law of Workmen's Compensation in this area... for instance, the case of Hammerle, which is the Pennsylvania Workmen's Compensation that recognizes the compensability of emotional injury, the test is: Was the emotional illness a reasonable reaction to an abnormal working circumstance?</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.332" offset="10603253">Which, actually, it is the... the only Workmen's Compensation type of case in Pennsylvania that actually requires proof of fault... proof of showing that the condition was abnormal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.014" offset="10658005">So, it's very interesting in this area that in... in the emotional recovery area in Workmen's Comp, the test does include the reasonable person test, which is a negligence concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.220" offset="10702831">And that is, this is not a... a subjective reaction, it is an objective test in Workmen's Compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.254" offset="10726969">So, I... I come... I cite the issue with some hesitancy, because of the knee-jerk reaction of railroads generally to the mention of Workmen's Compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.392" offset="10759465">But I mention it because of Justice O'Connor's question, so that this Court understands that what Conrail is really arguing here is that an entire class of genuine, foreseeable, real and severe injuries go completely uncompensated in the face of the clear language of the statute in 1908 that every injury suffered at the hands of the negligence of the railroad, in whole or in part, should be in fact compensated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.306" offset="10859148">And there's a couple of other points that I want to make as a matter of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.749" offset="10872941">This Court has recently addressed the issue, and actually reaffirmed its faith and its confidence in the American adversary system and in the jury in the case of Dalbert, and also in the case of... Harris.</text>

            <text syncTime="2968.142" offset="12022538">It is overinclusive and underinclusive at the same time, just as a physical impact test.</text>

            <text syncTime="2997.240" offset="12138939">And there... there are... are'a myriad of examples, Justice Kennedy, using it in the Gottshall case, if in fact, Mr. Gottshall had fallen on the way to help, then there would have been the contemporaneous physical injury and, magically, he would have fallen within the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.750" offset="12192960">I have to, because I represent Alan Carlisle, make another point.</text>

            <text syncTime="3034.595" offset="12288360">Because Alan Carlisle is in the operations aspect of a dynamic transportation injury... industry... the movement of hazardous materials that involve catastrophe that would, in fact, compromise entire communities.</text>

            <text syncTime="3049.223" offset="12346874">My client's stress was fear for whole communities; that he was being asked to make moment-to-moment decisions about catastrophe with inadequate, outdated commit... equipment, which was proven by a Government study of the exact office and the exact defendant at the very same time, which they ignored.</text>

            <text syncTime="3106.512" offset="12576020">We cannot use 18th and 19th century crutches, such as the physical impact rule, to resolve 20th and 21st century work place problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.871" offset="12621473">In Dalbert, this Court... and it's actually the test in the Third Circuit... that the scientific validity of the medical evidence in emotional duress test cases, the gatekeeping function of... of the Federal court judges can in fact identify the reliability of that validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.110" offset="12678420">And if in fact it meets that test, then those... that expert testimony, which in both these cases, the injuries are supported with, substantiated by medical expert testimony, in my case, liability... that is, that a reasonable person under the same circumstances, normally constituted, would have suffered the same or similar injuries, by Dr. Paul Rouech, who is in fact a consultant for the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, found... was the expert on liability in the Carlisle case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.987" offset="12785836">I am asking this Court to affirm the decisions below, and affirm our confidence and our commitment, and reject, and not be counseled by the fears that Conrail would like to in fact share with us, and affirm our belief in the working ability of American juries and of the adversary system to find the truth and to compensate the meritorious case, which was in fact both the text and the legislative history.</text>
