            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="91041">The second case is No. 92-1911, coming to us on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Washington, its Public Utility District No. 1 of Jefferson County against the Department of Ecology.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.899" offset="178603">Section 401 of the Clean Water Act requires states to provide a water quality certification before a federal license can be issued for any activity that may result in a discharge in the intrastate navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.639" offset="241506">The petitioners are city and local utility district, want to build a hydroelectric project on the Dosewallips River.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.030" offset="275152">The project would reduce the water flow in the relevant part of the river to a residual flow of between 65 and 155 cubic feet per second.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.830" offset="318306">To protect the river's fisheries, the respondent state issued a Section 401 certification imposing, among other things, a minimum stream flow requirement of between 100 and 200 cubic feet per second.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.284" offset="384135">The Washington Supreme Court affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.909" offset="394584">In the opinion filed today, we also affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.079" offset="411302">We hold that Washington State's minimum stream flow requirement is a permissible condition in our Section 401 certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.962" offset="450799">The State may impose requirements to ensure that activities which may result in a discharge into the navigable waters will comply with state water quality standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.068" offset="495312">Moreover, a state may impose conditions on certification in so far as necessary to enforce a designated use contained in the state's water quality standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.771" offset="538048">The minimum stream flow is such a requirement because it is necessary to protect the designated use of the river as a fish habitat.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.559" offset="573261">Petitioners' assertion that the Clean Water Act is only concerned with water quality, not quantity, rests on an artificial distinction since a sufficient lowering of quantity could destroy all of the river's designated uses and since the Act recognizes that reduced stream flow can constitute water pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.588" offset="661346">Finally, we are unwilling to read implied limitations into Section 401 based on a petitioners' claim that a conflict exists between the stream flow condition and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's authority to license hydroelectric projects under the Federal Power Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.324" offset="736265">The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has not yet acted on petitioner's license application and we do not decide here that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.241" offset="775972">Justice Stevens has filed a concurring opinion; Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion which Justice Scalia has joined.</text>
