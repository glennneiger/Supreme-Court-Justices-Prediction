            <text syncTime="10.456" offset="193894">Mr. Wright.</text>

            <label>Mr. Christopher J. Wright</label>
            <text syncTime="11.239" offset="197029">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.974" offset="207896">The issue in this case is whether Federal agencies must disclose the home addresses of Federal employees to unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.913" offset="235690">Three statutes are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.929" offset="243736">The Federal labor relations statute provides that, to the extent not prohibited by law, unions are entitled to information that's necessary for collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.737" offset="286994">The parties agree that</text>
            <text syncTime="36.006" offset="296085">"to the extent not prohibited by law. "</text>
            <text syncTime="37.989" offset="304026">references the Privacy Act, and the parties further agree that in the absence of an applicable exception to the Privacy Act, the home addresses are not discloseable.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.349" offset="353450">So the legal issue here is whether an exception to the Privacy Act authorizes the disclosure of home addresses.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.837" offset="379363">The parties further agree that the only arguably relevant exception here is exception (b)(2) to the Privacy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.858" offset="419487">That exception says that information that has to be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act may be disclosed under the Privacy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.148" offset="456686">And the parties also agree that when analyzed under FOIA, the question is whether FOIA Exemption 6 applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.606" offset="494511">It states that information should not be disclosed when that would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.260" offset="529097">Now, at this point the agreement between the parties ceases.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.414" offset="541740">The Federal Labor Relations Authority takes the position that home addresses must be disclosed to unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.734" offset="567027">Critical to its conclusion in that regard is its contention that in deciding what gets weighed under FOIA Exemption 6, that collective bargaining interests get weighed in that FOIA balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.077" offset="628362">We disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.327" offset="633378">We agree with the D.C. Circuit, which analyzed this case and said that all that gets weighed on the FOIA side of the balance is the interest in disclosing what the Government's up to.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.099" offset="676428">And we agree with the D.C. Circuit that it would, in fact, require an imaginative reconstruction of the statutes at issue to read them the way the FLRA has read them.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="140.805" offset="715298">And yet it's true that every circuit so construed this complex of statutes until this Court's decision in Reporters Committee, is that not right?</text>

            <label>Mr. Christopher J. Wright</label>
            <text syncTime="152.512" offset="762109">That's correct, Your Honor, and the Fifth Circuit noted that in its decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.333" offset="785411">I would say that really what that shows is that prior to this Court's decision in Reporters Committee, a handful of courts of appeals had misconstrued FOIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.558" offset="822296">Each of those courts had concluded that collective bargaining agreements... or, excuse me, collective bargaining interests could be weighed on the FOIA side of the balance.</text>

            <text syncTime="176.664" offset="858658">It was... it was more than collective bargaining interests in itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.650" offset="882691">It was another statute.</text>

            <label>Mr. Christopher J. Wright</label>
            <text syncTime="184.967" offset="891886">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.185" offset="896797">Those courts had held that the interests that can be weighed on the FOIA side of the balance are not limited to those interests that tell you what the Government's up to or that open the light of agency action to public scrutiny, the interests that this Court identified in Reporters Committee as the sole... as the sole interest that may be weighed on the FOIA side of the balance.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="207.683" offset="982792">So do I take it that your position is that the labor management relations statute counts for nothing?</text>
            <text syncTime="215.205" offset="1012885">It seems that it's no different, in your analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.574" offset="1026364">If this had been a plain old FOIA request from any member of the public, that we should regard this situation precisely the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.346" offset="1061473">It doesn't matter that it's a union making the request.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.798" offset="1071190">It doesn't matter that the request emanates initially from the labor management relations statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.952" offset="1095850">Is that correct?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Christopher J. Wright</label>
            <text syncTime="237.135" offset="1100552">That's how we read the... that's how we read the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.154" offset="1108702">The Federal... the case starts with the Federal labor relations statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.789" offset="1127197">It references the Privacy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.808" offset="1139318">We all agree that if the case ended there, home addresses would not be discloseable.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.962" offset="1155931">The only arguable exception is this FOIA exception, and once placed wholly within FOIA's domain, in our view, the union stands in no different position than any member of the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.019" offset="1204101">And the further point follows that if... if, in fact, home addresses are discloseable to unions, then under Reporters Committee they're discloseable to everyone, thus magnifying--</text>

            <text syncTime="275.077" offset="1252376">Why does that... why does that follow?</text>
            <text syncTime="276.110" offset="1256451">I mean if it's discloseable to unions, presumably it's because the weighing process is giving effect to Federal statutory policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.116" offset="1296470">That is not going to affect a request from somebody off the street.</text>

            <text syncTime="316.904" offset="1419664">--Well, Your Honor, in Reporters Committee the Court... the Court emphasized that there's a very strong public interest in learning about anyone's criminal history.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.176" offset="1456758">Rap sheets were an issue there.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="327.962" offset="1463863">There was nothing comparable to the... that was a straight FOIA request by the Reporters Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.116" offset="1488522">Here we have a request that is made not under FOIA, but under the labor management relations statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.186" offset="1516839">And that's... the presence of another statute was not a factor in Reporters Committee.</text>

            <text syncTime="350.225" offset="1552993">First... first, of course, you're correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.243" offset="1565009">But the way the statutes read with the Federal labor relations statute and the Privacy Act interaction, then passing it wholly off to the FOIA area, we don't think the fact that another statute could be referenced makes a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.884" offset="1623628">But as I was saying, there is a legitimate public interest in identifying... in learning about people's criminal histories.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.304" offset="1657274">And I suppose someone could have... could have identified a recidivist statute or various other sorts of statutes as showing that there's a public interest that's on the books, that shows that there's interest in finding out whether people are convicted felons or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="388.797" offset="1707220">I took it to be one of the bases of our decision in Reporters Committee that the personnel at agencies who have to deal with FOIA requests cannot be expected to inquire into the individuated needs of each requester.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.025" offset="1788095">And so you have to decide it on an in gross basis, should the public at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.198" offset="1812859">Now, assuming... assuming that that's correct, would it make an enormous exception from that to say, well, we won't consider the individuated needs of the public at large, but we will consider policies that are set forth in Federal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.659" offset="1890704">How much of a big exception would that be to the policy we were trying to further in Reporters Committee?</text>

            <text syncTime="595.943" offset="2535824">I, you know... I've been talking about it as a FOIA case only because the Privacy Act exception refers you to FOIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.847" offset="2559438">And so thereafter you analyze it like a FOIA case.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.513" offset="2570096">But if it's... if you're just appealing to privacy interests, I find it really very strange that the Federal Government should not allow to be obtained from Federal employees what it requires to be provided from non-Federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.873" offset="2635507">I mean, if anything, you would think that Federal employees would be... certainly in other areas Federal employees have less privacy than private citizens, and you're telling us that we have a statute here which gives more privacy to Federal employees than to private citizens, because a private citizen, his address is obtainable by a labor union.</text>

            <text syncTime="639.167" offset="2708754">Well, if I can make both a legal and an equitable argument to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.971" offset="2723905">The legal argument is that the Privacy Act applies here and it doesn't apply in the private sector, and that seems to us to be a very important difference and indicates that Federal employees have privacy rights that private employees don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.648" offset="2782629">Turning to the equitable point, I think that there are some very important differences between the private sector and the Federal sector, and the chief of which is that it's clear that Federal unions can arrange to get adequate contact with employees at the workplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.359" offset="2857443">One key difference is that there's a Federal Service Impasses Panel that can impose proposals on agency management over their objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.548" offset="2894224">So if unions want more contact with employees at work... and there's no real issue here that unions have plenty of... Federal unions have plenty of contact at work.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.404" offset="2929646">They can... they can get more contact.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.439" offset="2937796">They can certainly get enough contact to ask the employees for their home address.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.641" offset="2954619">I mean, as a practical matter, what's at issue here is whether we're going to override the choices of Federal employees who have not made their home addresses available to unions, and hold that those home addresses have to be disclosed anyway, even though the employees don't want their home addresses disclosed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2705.127" offset="10972539">And this certainly is a matter which affects Federal sector labor relations, whether or not Federal employee unions are able to receive this information.</text>

            <text syncTime="2742.816" offset="11123318">The Congress has specifically declared its support for the public interest in collective bargaining and Federal sector labor organizations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2770.866" offset="11235540">Recognizing the importance of collective bargaining in considering and analyzing information requests does minimal harm to the private interests of Federal sector employees, gives import to the public interest in collective bargaining, and is supported by this Court's prior decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2800.303" offset="11353300">Let me make clear that the unions have the names of the employees in the bargaining unit, and they have the work addresses of the employees in the bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.693" offset="11394782">And Mr. Smith went on at some length about how it can be difficult to get a hold of new employees' addresses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.281" offset="11421218">Let me make clear that there are many collective bargaining agreements that require management four times a year, for example, to provide to the union a list of the names and worksite mailing addresses of all employees in the unit, highlighting those hired during the prior quarter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.893" offset="11487569">So it's quite easy to get a hold of the names and work addresses of Federal employees, and it's done all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.499" offset="11522051">Let me way a word about the routine-use exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.550" offset="11542217">Two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.235" offset="11549009">One, of course, is that the routine-use exception is clearly limited to unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.222" offset="11568967">Private information that is disclosed under routine use only goes to unions, not to the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.210" offset="11596865">Let me say as well that we can't just decide tomorrow morning to make a routine-use and give something out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.280" offset="11625182">The statute provides, first, various procedural requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.684" offset="11642736">But also that it has... that the information has to be used for a purpose that is compatible with the purpose for which it was collected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.438" offset="11669799">OPM has construed that to mean that home addresses may be disclosed when there is no good way to get a hold of employees at the workplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.729" offset="11714939">OPM thinks it's compatible with the purpose for which home addresses are collected to contact employees at home when there is some sort of emergency or when you can't collect them at work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.620" offset="11758511">And they certainly don't think that these can be handed out left and right despite the Privacy Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3161.665" offset="12798707">Mr. Wright, could I ask about deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.582" offset="12806335">There... there are two arguments being made here by the labor board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.803" offset="12827233">One is that the statute does not, as you say, refer everything to FOIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.824" offset="12859311">That it... it refers it to FOIA but with something of its own in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.276" offset="12877179">And the other argument is that even under FOIA, they... simpliciter, they ought to get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.680" offset="12898808">Now, as to the latter, I think you've... the argument in your brief that no deference is owed is quite correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.584" offset="12918348">But as to the former, don't you have to give deference?</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.720" offset="12934962">I mean isn't your argument as to the former, yes, we owe them deference but this goes beyond the scope of the reasonable, and therefore the deference doesn't carry us that far?</text>

            <text syncTime="3204.642" offset="12970593">Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.026" offset="12972160">That... well, they get deference under... under section 7114 of the federal labor relations statute, but that leads you right to the Privacy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.332" offset="13001417">They don't get deference in construing the Privacy Act, which is what directs you to FOIA, or under FOIA.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="3217.651" offset="13022629">So there's deference in making the argument that this doesn't... doesn't adopt the Privacy Act unamended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.139" offset="13044571">It puts into the Privacy Act when you're making your request under the labor statute, this... this modification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.376" offset="13077590">That's the argument they're making.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.495" offset="13081979">And the only response to that, it seems to me, has to be, well, yes, you're... you know, there's deference, but fun's fun, but you can't die laughing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.399" offset="13113639">That's your argument.</text>
