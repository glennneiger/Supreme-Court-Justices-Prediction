            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="91796">I have the opinion of the Court to announce in No.92-1292, Luther B. Campbell versus Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.063" offset="127949">In 1964 the respondent, Acuff-Rose, obtained the rights to a rock ballad called "Oh Pretty Woman".</text>
            <text syncTime="17.078" offset="160028">Petitioners Luther Campbell and others are collectively known as 2 Live Crew, a rap music group.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.860" offset="187195">In 1989, Campbell wrote a song entitled "Pretty Woman" which he described is intended through comical lyrics to satirize the original song written 25 years earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.860" offset="235156">2 Live Crew sought permission to use the original song and offered payment, but Acuff-Rose said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.652" offset="262323">Nonetheless, 2 Live Crew released records, cassette tapes, and compact discs of Pretty Woman in a collection of songs entitled "As Clean as They Wanna Be".</text>
            <text syncTime="52.990" offset="303701">When Acuff-Rose sued 2 Live Crew and its record company for copyright infringement, 2 Live Crew raised the defense of fair use within the meaning of the Copyright Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.295" offset="344975">The District Court granted summary judgment for 2 Live Crew reasoning that 2 Live Crew's song was a parody that made fair use of the original.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.786" offset="378934">The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.697" offset="390532">It concerted among other things, that the blatantly commercial purpose of the parody prevented it from being a fair use.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.445" offset="421566">We granted certiorari to determine whether 2 Live Crew's commercial parody could be a fair use.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.669" offset="446434">As explained in an opinion authored by Justice Souter, we now reverse and remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.158" offset="468377">A parody like other commented criticism may claim to be fair use, and the Court of Appeals erred in placing virtually dispositive weight on the commercial nature of the parody.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.725" offset="514666">A parody's commercial character is only one element to be weighed in a fair use inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.085" offset="536087">The heart of any parodist's claim to quote from existing material is the use of some elements of a prior author's composition to create a new one that at least in part comments on that author's work, as 2 Live Crew's song reasonably could be perceived as doing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.953" offset="603587">And so, the Court of Appeals we hold is wrong in directing the entry of judgment for the copyright holder.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.665" offset="626366">There are factual issues regarding excessive copying and market substitution which are still to be resolved and to be addressed on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.522" offset="661788">The opinion is unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.006" offset="667744">Justice Kennedy has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
