            <text syncTime="21.214" offset="219070">This case presents the question of whether the qualified immunity issue in civil rights actions is governed by a special rule that requires that appellate courts treat legal authorities as if they were facts such that the appellate court is required to blind itself to relevant and potentially controlling legal authorities if those authorities were not presented to or considered by the district court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.473" offset="328053">In the proceedings below the Ninth Circuit ruled that the qualified immunity issue... on appeal, the legal authorities that are relevant to that must be treated as if they are no other legal authorities other than those that were cited to or discovered by the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.993" offset="398165">The appellate court, according to this ruling, may not consider other legal authorities it is aware of even if those authorities demonstrate that, contrary to the district court's ruling, there is no qualified immunity because at the time of the incident it was clearly established that the officer's conduct violated the plaintiff's civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.457" offset="479981">This is a special rule established only for the qualified immunity issue in civil rights cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="126.473" offset="640059">And the ascertainment of that is governed, as with any other question of law, by have... by looking at decisions precedent, statutes, other sources of legal authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="143.558" offset="708395">But the issue of whether it's a question of law for the purpose before us here, just as the question of whether it's a question of law for purposes of whether it's a jury or the judge, there are all sorts of different contexts in which that issue could come up.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.686" offset="764924">And it seems to me that we're looking for an essentially factual matter here, aren't we?</text>
            <text syncTime="161.479" offset="780075">What was... on the basis of legal authorities, what was the understood nature... not what was the real law, because the real law hasn't changed, it's always been the same, but what was the understood nature of the law at that time?</text>
            <text syncTime="174.799" offset="833365">That's a question of fact, it seems to me.</text>

            <text syncTime="176.371" offset="839635">--No, I believe that's a question of law, because it's a question which does not go to trying to ascertain evidence in the sense of evidence that may be impeached or contradicted or contradictory.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.799" offset="881326">Proof... burdens of proof ordinarily deal with that kind of problem, dealing with the risk of uncertainty in trying to ascertain from evidence whether or not a particular fact occurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="240.667" offset="1096888">And, indeed, in Federal courts questions of ascertaining what the State law is is also a question of law on which principles of forfeiture or estoppel because a party didn't introduce particular facts in the proceedings below simply are inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.698" offset="1156970">The Court has repeatedly said that in dealing with deciding a question of law, courts are not limited to merely selecting among what has been presented by the parties or the contrasting interpretations of the authorities that have been presented, but have an independent obligation to ascertain what the correct rule of law is.</text>

            <text syncTime="1218.057" offset="5006374">But it also... it does answer the question that there is nothing about this rule that serves the interests that are behind qualified immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.533" offset="5036258">As you observe, it doesn't do anything to protect the exercise of official discretion or enhance deterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.794" offset="5061336">What it does do, however, is deny claims, meritorious claims by civil rights plaintiffs merely on the fact that the authority was not cited below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.942" offset="5101982">The effect of this is that an appellate court will be required to affirm the dismissal of a civil rights claim by a victim of a civil rights violation, not on the basis that the official's conduct should be subject to an immunity under the balance of the interests that this Court has identified, but solely on the basis that the necessary authorities were not cited in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.889" offset="5193724">This results in an unjust resolution of cases, because it is... it has to be accepted that the proper application of these interests and the test established in Harlow results in the proper disposition of civil rights cases where the qualified immunity issue is presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.830" offset="5269480">But this rule provides that there will be a different resolution in particular cases, depending upon what the citations of authority in the district court were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.758" offset="5305215">As enunciated by the Ninth Circuit, this rule applies regardless of whether the party is represented or not, regardless of how severe the official misconduct is, and regardless of how serious the injury that the civil rights plaintiff suffered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.387" offset="5359759">It is an imperfection in our system that the outcome of a party's case often turns on the thoroughness of the legal research in the district court, and that is an imperfection that is visited most harshly on pro se plaintiffs and individuals who have limited access to legal representation, but what this rule does is elevate that imperfection into a rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.731" offset="5445127">In summary, the rule that's been announced by the Ninth Circuit is wrong precisely because it alters the appellate process so that legal research during the district court proceedings will alter the appellate court's responsibility of correcting legal errors and making sure that legal issues were determined based on all the authorities that the appellate court is aware of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.885" offset="5537705">It is also wrong because there is no justification for denying a meritorious civil rights claim or creating an immunity for an officer based on what particular authorities were cited in the district court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2462.845" offset="9985522">He would impose a duty upon any court of appeal, including this Court, to consider law not cited by the parties, even if the failure was strategic or constituted invited error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.893" offset="10041737">Such a position would limit the discretion of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.828" offset="10069532">It would be compelled, as would any court of appeals, to become the researchers for the litigants.</text>

            <text syncTime="2509.927" offset="10173917">That is my understanding under the circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.361" offset="10191576">If you look at the way the Ninth Circuit framed the issue, they framed it by saying failed to cite to the district court and failed to cite to us on appeal, and I think they were exasperated and frustrated by the fact that at oral argument they said here's this Al-Azzawy case, and plaintiff's counsel distinguished it instead of adopting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.637" offset="10280706">So I think their position was motivated by error, by invited error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.750" offset="10305156">The panel decision does maintain the court as a neutral arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.334" offset="10335458">Instead of going out and doing the research for the litigants, it is to decide the legal question of what the law was based upon the record that's presented to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.552" offset="10376418">The panel decision also advances the social policies that this Court announced in Harlow and would also advance the burden of proof issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.861" offset="10425633">In the final analysis... since I'm addressing the issue that the Court asked me to address rather than the merits of the case, I'm going to finish a little early.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.118" offset="10478609">In the final analysis, the Court should affirm the panel because my deputy, Holloway, acted reasonably.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.093" offset="10510583">He was not plainly incompetent and he did not knowingly violate the law.</text>
