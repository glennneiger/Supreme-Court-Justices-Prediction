            <text syncTime="3316.451" offset="13413261">Going to Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, this hypothetical proves the deficiency in the Tennessee court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.537" offset="13449623">Yes, both the reckless killer and the intentional killer in the course of a robbery, house robbery, are subject to the death penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="3353.704" offset="13562263">After saying in the opinion, and after this Court has said previously, particularly in Tison, that a reckless killer can be equally culpable to a premeditated killer, the Tennessee court, in discussing the constitutionality of death for felony murder, said the exact same thing, and now what they're suggesting is that you've got to... you are more culpable in some way if the murder was premeditated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.130" offset="13660066">It would have been one thing if they had invalidated the felony murder aggravator, or the use of felony murder as a death-eligible device, but they didn't, and that is the illogic of the opinion, starting from the premise that they are equally culpable.</text>
