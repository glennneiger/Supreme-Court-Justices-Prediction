            <text syncTime="13.040" offset="203941">The question before this Court is whether Government may demand the dedication of real property as a condition of development approval, without showing that there is a reasonably proportional relationship between the dedication and the actual adverse impacts of the development.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.707" offset="258590">In the case that we have today, the City of Tigard demanded that Mrs. Dolan dedicate 10 percent of her real property, and the City did that without showing any proportional relationship whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.157" offset="312402">We submit that the failure of the City in requiring that dedication to show the proportional relationship violates the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, because it takes private property from her for public use, without payment of just compensation.</text>

            <text syncTime="64.242" offset="408741">And we would agree that the City would have been within its authority to deny the permit outright.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.296" offset="428908">However, that... that of course might raise a different takings question that's outside the realm of dedications and municipal exactions, and not only that, that... no, Your Honor, we are not.</text>

            <label>Mr. David B. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="87.138" offset="500274">Yes, Your Honor, that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.291" offset="508947">And one of the problems that we have is if... if all that is required in a threshold inquiry for dedication to meet constitutional muster is that the... the Government could have denied the permit outright, and never reach the question of whether there is the essential nexus or the requisite proportionality, then there is really no textual meaning that I believe is given to this Court's opinion in Nollan, and there is no fulfillment of the... the mandate in Armstrong v. United States, that individuals should not be singled out to bear public burdens that, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.317" offset="665055">The... the City really demanded Mrs. Dolan's land because it wanted it for free, to fulfill its longstanding plans for park... for a park and for a pedestrian and bicycle pathway.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.776" offset="714897">And it did that without any regard to the actual impacts of her new store.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.848" offset="735168">The City's so-called findings in this case were made up after the fact, and were mere speculation and conjecture.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.483" offset="761708">And the City--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="154.273" offset="768813">Well, so far as the finding about the flood plain is concerned, there was a finding that if you pave over with asphalt things that have been previously green or growing in some way, you're going to have a more rapid runoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.594" offset="830149">Now, that... that doesn't seem very speculative to me.</text>

            <label>Mr. David B. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="173.096" offset="844150">--Mr. Chief Justice, there is indeed common sense to tell us that if one increases the amount of a per... impervious surface on a piece of property, that there will indeed be more runoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.195" offset="892529">We would certainly agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.075" offset="900052">However, the problem is... and I think this was well pointed out by Justice Peterson of the Oregon Supreme Court in his dissenting opinion below... that there was never a quantification of exactly how much water would run off.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.742" offset="946759">And as Justice Peterson characterized it in his dissent, how much, a thimble full?</text>
            <text syncTime="203.627" offset="966299">In the absence of any quantification of the amount of water that would actually run off of a site, and comparing that to the overall amount of water that could run off from other structures throughout the City that increased impervious surface, there is really no way for the... the City to come up with a fair apportionment of the... of the cost that should be imposed on Mrs. Dolan.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="224.402" stopTime="236.800">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="224.402" offset="1049368">So, you say the City has to... has to quantify something like that, do some sort of empirical studies that would show the portion for which this increase in her usage... or her increased pavement is responsible?</text>

            <text syncTime="238.132" offset="1104225">In fact, I believe that the City itself recognized that that was the way to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.074" offset="1124079">That, in the record that's before this Court, at Docket Number F, at pages 810 and... and 811, it shows that the City, in the detailed study it did of storm water runoff, that its consultant commended to the City and urged the City to do a calculation on the total amount of impervious surface that would occur within the City at buildout, and as the people proposed development, they should calculate the specific development's contributions to that impervious surface and to use that relative fraction to apportion cost.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="277.646" offset="1262319">Is there any reason to believe that creating impervious surface closer to the flood plain causes more of a problem than creating impervious surface further away from the flood plain?</text>

            <text syncTime="298.242" offset="1344761">That is correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.023" offset="1351866">That, in fact, there are a number of properties that are not located on Fanno Creek itself in the City of Tigard that in fact may generate more storm water runoff than Mrs. Dolan's proposed new store.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.232" offset="1404634">But, in fact--</text>

            <text syncTime="314.444" offset="1409545">But isn't there... excuse me... isn't there some sort of attenuation?</text>
            <text syncTime="316.284" offset="1416859">I mean, if you're three miles from Fanno Creek and pave over 2,000 square feet, surely it's a lesser immediate effect on the creek than if you are right along the creek and pave over 2,000 square feet?</text>

            <text syncTime="330.774" offset="1474851">Assume that the additional runoff would require that some vegetation remain alongside of the creek.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.600" offset="1510168">Is it your position that the demands of the City are nevertheless excessive?</text>

            <text syncTime="345.604" offset="1534201">And the reason is, is that the City has already established regulatory restrictions on what can go on inside that 100-year flood plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.199" offset="1564503">And the Dolans are already prohibited from engaging in developmental uses of that 100-year flood plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.002" offset="1591775">And considering the geography in question, it is highly unlikely that... that anything could go on either.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.266" offset="1616852">It's a very, very steep bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.488" offset="1621659">So, the fact of the matter remains is there is no development that's going to go on within the 100-year flood plain.</text>

            <text syncTime="395.590" offset="1734090">In addition, they required the dedication of a 15-foot wide strip immediately adjacent and east of the boundary of the flood plain for construction of a pedestrian and bicycle pathway.</text>

            <text syncTime="2591.270" offset="10516875">The... the legitimacy of... of the flood plain approach taken by the City here has been addressed thus far only in terms of the adverse impacts that would be caused by increasing the impervious surface on the... on the parking lot and expanding the building.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.401" offset="10573404">And Petitioner suggests that the condition imposed on Mrs. Dolan should be proportional to that adverse impact.</text>

            <text syncTime="2621.553" offset="10637979">But there is another important consideration, and that's the benefit to Mrs. Dolan.</text>

            <text syncTime="3298.616" offset="13346250">That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.828" offset="13355027">I would... would make one more point about proportionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.801" offset="13370910">And that is, very essentially, that unless there is some requirement for proportionality between actual impacts and dedications, that even the most strenuous of dedications could have been required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.091" offset="13428065">The City could have found that Mrs. Dolan's new store would have increased traffic by one additional vehicle trip per day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.035" offset="13455860">In the absence of proportionality, the City could have required her to dedicate 75, 95 percent of her land for a widening of Main Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.379" offset="13493267">No proportionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.520" offset="13497865">We have our rational relationship.</text>

            <text syncTime="3358.607" offset="13586159">And, in fact, there is at least one State that I am told... the State of... I believe it's Virginia... that even requires the old Illinois test and requires even a heightened degree of proportionality that puts an extreme burden on Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.637" offset="13638299">And it's noteworthy that... that both the New Jersey and Wisconsin tests were adopted in the 1960's, well before this Court established its ruling in Nollan, and they have worked quite well.</text>
