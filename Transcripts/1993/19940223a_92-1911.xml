            <label>Mr. Howard E. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="57.729" offset="374329">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="61.032" offset="387599">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the supreme court of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.033" offset="407557">It concerns streamflow quantities for fish habitat at the proposed Elkhorn hydroelectric project on the Dosewallips River.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.732" offset="450398">The project is subject to licensing under part 1 of the Federal Power Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.265" offset="476520">Streamflow requirements determine the quantity of water in cubic feet per second that may be diverted by the hydroelectric project, and the quantity that must continue to flow in the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.555" offset="529705">Now, the use of streamflow to generate electricity is at the core of the licensing scheme for hydroelectric projects in part 1 of the Federal Power Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.292" offset="576621">The question here is whether streamflow quantities at the proposed project are to be determined by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under the broadly balanced public interest considerations in part 1 of the Federal Power Act, or by conditions imposed in State certifications under section 401 of the Federal Clean Water Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.201" offset="680275">If Washington had attempted to impose the challenged streamflow conditions independently of the Federal statute, its action would have been preempted by the Federal Power Act under this Court's decisions in California v. FERC, decided in 1990, and in First Iowa Hydroelectric Cooperative v. FPC, decided in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.047" offset="783615">So another way of stating the question here is whether section 401 of the Clean Water Act shields a State's attempt to regulate streamflow quantities at a hydroelectric project from preemption by part 1 of the Federal Power Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.399" offset="845055">If the certification conditions in the State section 401 certification are outside of the scope of section 401, then there is no shielding effect.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="188.304" offset="896673">Mr. Shapiro, wouldn't a decision as to preemption be premature here, since the Commission hasn't yet acted on the application for a license?</text>

            <text syncTime="200.272" offset="944530">The reason is that the process here calls for the certification to be issued as a condition precedent to the issuance of a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.891" offset="991028">Under section 401(d) of the Clean Water Act, the conditions in the certification become conditions in the license, so that--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="222.850" offset="1034809">The Commission is not capable, then, of saying that the amount of water set aside in the certificate is not consistent with the project we have in mind and therefore we're going to change it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="howard_e_shapiro" startTime="236.627" stopTime="334.252">
            <label>Mr. Howard E. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="236.627" offset="1089980">--That is correct, Your Honor, and this point was quite correctly recognized by the supreme court of Washington at petitioner's appendix page 16a, where it pointed out the very thing I have said, that FERC has to comply with the certification condition regardless of its legality.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.072" offset="1183707">Now, the case they relied on... U.S. Department of Interior v. FERC... was a case that involved a challenge by the State of West Virginia to licenses issued on the Ohio River, and in that case West Virginia said that the State of Washing... the State of West Virginia said that FERC was encroaching on its section 401 conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.843" offset="1302825">In its decision, FERC said no, we cannot impose different conditions, we will comply with what the State says in its certification, and that case was... the D.C. Circuit's decision in that case was based upon an acceptance of the FERC's representations that it was bound.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.979" offset="1391328">Now, the United States in its amicus brief has suggested the possibility of a conflict, but I don't see how that can happen under the law as it is structured, since neither FERC nor any Federal court can review an initial section 401 certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.558" offset="1457679">The entire process has to come up under the Federal statute, to be sure, but through the State court system.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="334.252" stopTime="359.851">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="334.252" offset="1480458">And certainly the consultation process that the Federal Power Commission, now FERC, is supposed to engage in with the State authorities before determining... before issuing the license and before determining what the proper flow is in order to preserve fish habitat and so forth, that consultation process becomes rather superfluous if the State has a trump card.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="howard_e_shapiro" startTime="359.851" stopTime="557.314">
            <label>Mr. Howard E. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="359.851" offset="1582858">That is exactly right, and that is really the essence of our argument that in effect we have a kind of a reversal of the preemption process.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.963" offset="1611279">If a State puts in a condition that's outside of its 401 authority, that condition still must be included in the license.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.509" offset="1645447">FERC cannot review it, and FERC never gets to the point of undertaking its responsibilities under section 10(j) of the Federal Power Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.979" offset="1691423">Section 10(j) was enacted in 1946, and it said that the State... recommendations of State fish and wildlife agencies as well as Federal fish and wildlife agencies must be accepted as the basis for any conditions to protect fish and wildlife that the FERC includes in its license, unless it makes very specific findings after attempting to reconcile its differences with the State's or Federal wildlife agencies that the conditions are inconsistent with the purposes and requirements of the Federal Power Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.725" offset="1854322">So what we have here is a situation in which the States can completely circumvent that process simply by imposing conditions in the 401 certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.203" offset="1896223">In fact, that happened in this case, in a related case as one of the amici have pointed out at some length.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.187" offset="1928197">Having... I think we should turn immediately to the language of section 401 of the act, because it's fairly forthright.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.417" offset="1989114">It appears in petitioner's appendix at page 134a.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.833" offset="2018789">There are two things that are quite apparent from that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.486" offset="2037389">First, the certification process, which is a delegation of Federal authority to the State, is one that not only makes the certification a condition precedent to the Federal license, but it also... under section 401, the statute clearly distinguishes between certifications by the States and the licensing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.602" offset="2137908">It doesn't transfer the licensing process to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.224" offset="2148357">Thus, the fundamental balancing process FERC is supposed to undertake remains in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.069" offset="2175733">Now, the second... and this is an important point about section 401... is that the State's delegated authority is limited by the text to certifying whether any discharge from the licensed activity complies with the applicable water quality provisions that are specifically enumerated in section 401(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="532.436" offset="2273222">So States aren't authorized to regulate the activity itself... that is, to regulate the hydropower project.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.281" offset="2300598">They are to regulate discharges from the hydropower project.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.355" offset="2316899">Now, among the enumerated provisions specifically listed is section 303 of the Clean Water Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.982" offset="2359426">Section 303 relates to water quality standards.</text>

            <text syncTime="1445.219" offset="5924304">The question before the Court today is whether Washington State can enforce its water quality, both the criteria and the antidegradation policy adopted consistent with EPA mandate pursuant to the Clean Water Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.006" offset="5979475">What we have here are water quality standards adopted by the State of Washington, including three key elements:</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.862" offset="6006956">First, a designation of the uses of the water body, 2) The criteria necessary to protect those designated uses, and 3) an antidegradation policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.200" offset="6048229">That antidegradation policy is intended to protect existing uses, those, in this case, of salmon and steelhead.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.245" offset="6080412">At this proposed project is a dam 50 feet wide which will block the entire channel and divert, on average, 75 percent of the water down to the powerhouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.731" offset="6126388">The central question before this Court then is, can Washington State enforce all of its water quality standards including its antidegradation policy by protecting those existing uses by setting a minimum instream flow or is Washington State limited only to its criteria and the amount of water that may be in that stream at the end of the construction of the project.</text>

            <text syncTime="3186.816" offset="12890744">The focus on uses has a reason here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.157" offset="12908089">The State admits at page 24 of the red brief that there is no violation by this project of the criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.292" offset="12940585">The phrase they use is, it is likely that there is no violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.925" offset="12955109">When the certificate was issued, the certificate, which is in the record at petitioner's appendix 83, expressly says that the streamflow requirements are in excess of those required for water quality standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.954" offset="13007250">When the case was before the Pollution Hearing Control Board on motion for summary judgment, that board said that it is clear that these streamflows are not based on and were not intended to be supported by water quality standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.694" offset="13070257">It wasn't until we got to the supreme court of Washington that we got to antidegradation policy, which came back into the case as a part of the water quality standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.071" offset="13103694">Now, antidegradation policy... it's all recognized... is established under section 303.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.103" offset="13131906">That is what the 1987 amendments refer to, the antidegradation policy established under this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.999" offset="13159491">Our position is, quite simply, that if it's established under section 303, it has to comply with the requirements of section 303, and those requirements are that a water quality standard shall consist of uses and criteria, and that in fact is what we're... what's involved with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.301" offset="13232634">The antidegradation policy applied here was the policy for protecting existing uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.117" offset="13259906">That's set forth at petitioner's appendix, page 7a, in the supreme court of Washington's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.440" offset="13281222">Protecting existing uses under EPA's regulations and practice requires that there be criteria to protect the existing uses.</text>

            <text syncTime="3327.088" offset="13451854">Our position is that the phrase in section 303(c) about uses and criteria is conjunctive, and Congress didn't intend there to be uses independent of criteria, because then there would be no need for the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.837" offset="13506815">We could take that long administrative regulation I referred Your Honors to in the red brief and just throw out all the criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.652" offset="13534087">In fact, you wouldn't need most of the Clean Water Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.944" offset="13547253">Now, the Clean Water Act expressly says in section 101(a) that it is intended to achieve the physical, chemical, and biological integrity of water, but it also says in the second sentence of section 101(a) that these goals are to be achieved consistent with the provisions of this act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.325" offset="13608798">The implementation of that goal is what the fight has been about for nearly 20 years in shaping the Clean Water Act, and therefore I suggest that the Clean Water Act has to be read, particularly when you're dealing with the delegations to the States in section 401, in accordance with the limitations that Congress has provided, otherwise the act turns into something absolutely shapeless.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.421" offset="13717153">There was a reference by the United States to the Escondido case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.088" offset="13747769">Now, the Escondido case was a case involving the authority of the Secretary of Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture to impose a condition on a hydroelectric license under the Federal Power Act if the hydroelectric project is located on reservations subject to the control of those officials, and the Court said that while the condition had to be included in the license, the applicant or FERC could challenge... the condition's reasonableness was subject to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.671" offset="13890189">But of course, that is a condition specified under the scheme of the Clean Water Act... under the scheme of the Federal Power Act.</text>
