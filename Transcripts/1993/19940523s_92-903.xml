            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="91013">I have an opinion to announce in No. 92-903, Posters 'N' Things v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.644" offset="121524">The cases, which have been around here a while, the case comes to us from the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.928" offset="154647">Petitioners were convicted on a number of charges under a statute known as 21 U.S.C. Section 857.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.774" offset="186099">These included the use of an interstate conveyance as part of the scheme to sell drug paraphernalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.285" offset="216087">In searching, petitioner Acty's residence and her business premissest, the officers seize a number of drug related items.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.345" offset="252345">The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.528" offset="265093">It held that the statute requires proof of scienter and that the Act is not unconstitutionally vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.496" offset="296962">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we also affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.628" offset="313472">The statute merely establishes objective scienter requirements for determining what constitutes drug paraphernalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.352" offset="348371">The statue properly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.829" offset="358298">It requires the government to prove that the defendant knowingly made use of an interstate conveyance as part of a scheme to sell items that he knew were likely to be used with illegal drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.239" offset="407931">It need not prove specific knowledge about the dorms that the items are drug paraphernalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.384" offset="436456">Also, the statute is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.988" offset="458922">Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment and is joined therein by Justice Kennedy and Justice Thomas.</text>
