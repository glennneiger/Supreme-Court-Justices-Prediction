            <text syncTime="8.357" offset="124404">The Massachusetts' pricing order imposes an assessment on all fluid milk sold by dealers to Massachusetts' retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.098" offset="159408">About two third of that milk is produced out of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.650" offset="173619">The entire assessment, however, is distributed to Massachusetts' dairy farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.215" offset="191905">The question presented is whether the pricing order unconstitutionally discriminates against interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.607" offset="217400">The petitioners in this case are two milk dealers who import milk from neighboring states and distribute it to Massachusetts' retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.602" offset="249479">After paying the assessment for two months, they refuse to make further payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.188" offset="267764">When respondent, the Commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Food and Agriculture, initiated proceedings to revoke their licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.371" offset="300470">Petitioners filed an action in State Court seeking an injunction against the enforcement of the pricing order on the ground that it has violated the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.075" offset="343310">The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts upheld the order reasoning that although it had an adverse impact on interstate commerce, the local benefits provided to the Commonwealth Dairy Industry outweigh any such incidental burden on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.444" offset="408825">We reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.669" offset="413736">The pricing order does violate the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution because it discriminates against out of state producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.298" offset="444248">Assessments under the pricing order are effectively a tax which makes milk produced out of state more expensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.002" offset="470997">Although the tax also applies to milk produced in Massachusetts, its effect on Massachusetts' producers is more than offset by the subsidy provided exclusively to the local dairy farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.620" offset="517495">Respondent's argument that the burden on interstate commerce is outweighed by the local benefits of preserving the Massachusetts' dairy industry would make a virtue of the vice that the rule against interstate discrimination condemns.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.865" offset="566501">Preservation of local industry by protecting it from the rigorous of interstate competition is the hallmark of the economic protectionism that the Commerce Clause forbids.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.671" offset="609655">Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas, has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment; The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Blackmun has joined.</text>
