            <text syncTime="12.372" offset="196314">Respondent was taken into custody on narcotics charges by California sheriffs on a Friday afternoon in August 1988 during the execution of a search warrant at his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.382" offset="256395">Because counterfeit currency was found during that Friday search, the State authorities contacted the United States Secret Service on Monday morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.087" offset="291190">Respondent was questioned by Secret Service agents late on Monday morning, and he admitted to knowingly possessing the counterfeit currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.961" offset="334658">The Secret Service agents then took him into custody on a Federal counterfeiting charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.263" offset="355870">After writing a complaint and booking respondent on that charge, the agents were informed by the Clerk of the Federal Court that there was no more room on the presentment calendar for the magistrate that day, and were instructed to bring respondent back before the magistrate on Tuesday.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.309" offset="424101">That is what they did.</text>

            <text syncTime="102.446" offset="556594">The district court found respondent's confession voluntary and admitted it at his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.536" offset="580941">Respondent was convicted, but the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the confession should have been suppressed under 18 U.S.C. section 3501.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.991" offset="622841">Section 3501 has three subsections that are relevant to the Ninth Circuit's analysis of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.747" offset="653874">Subsection (a) provides that if the trial judge finds that if a confession was voluntarily made, she must admit it in evidence, subsection (b) provides that in determining the issue of voluntariness, the trial judge must considered all the circumstances surrounding the giving of the confession, including, among others, any delay in presentment, and subsection (c) precludes the district court from suppressing a confession solely because of delay if the confession was voluntary and was made within 6 hours of the defendant's arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.318" offset="792114">The Ninth Circuit thought, or concluded, that subsection (c) required suppression of respondent's confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.340" offset="824193">It reasoned that the negative implication of subsection (c) is that a confession made more than 6 hours after the defendant's arrest may be suppressed solely because of delay, even if it is voluntary and therefore mandatorily admissible under subsection (a).</text>

            <text syncTime="191.622" offset="913323">The Ninth Circuit indicated that it had to, in effect, carve an exception to subsection (a) in order to give meaning to the negative implication from subsection (c), and in light of its conclusion that any confession that falls outside of the 6-hour safe harbor may be suppressed because of delay, the Court then went on to hold that the confession in this case fell outside of the 6-hour safe harbor because it was given more than 6 hours after the arrest by the California authorities on Friday, rather than by the Federal authorities on Monday.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.498" offset="1068803">Now, in our view, the Ninth Circuit was wrong to start the 6-hour clock running with the State arrest, and in any event, the Ninth Circuit was wrong to conclude that a negative implication from subsection (c) should override an express affirmative statement in subsection (a).</text>

            <text syncTime="354.912" offset="1566488">That was the subject of this Court's supervisory rule under the McNabb-Mallory line of cases, and is actually how subsection (c) reads.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.168" offset="1599507">Subsection (c) speaks of delay in bringing the defendant before a magistrate authorized to set bail for Federal offenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="385.515" offset="1688950">That is to say, so long as it's a genuine arrest for a State crime, and there's no anticipation that he's going to be drawn before a Federal magistrate, the Federal officers can, working hand-in-glove with the State officers, induce them to hold the prisoner for too long without presenting him--</text>

            <text syncTime="478.293" offset="2059994">It is only when the action is to evade, and only to evade, the requirements of Rule 5(a) that we think it is appropriate to consider the fact that the defendant has been taken into custody as the act of the Federal Government, and in making that point, we point not only to the text of subsection (c) that, of course, speaks to delay in bringing the defendant in front of a Federal judge, but also to the history and the background that preceded the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.072" offset="2243164">Under any view of the legislative history, section 3501 was intended at least to limit and narrow the McNabb-Mallory rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="609.262" offset="2583906">So one of the examples is a case in which there is in fact no law that allows the State to do what it is doing, so there is in fact a clear inference, hopefully supported by other facts, that all that is going on is that the Federal agents are using the State to do their bidding.</text>

            <text syncTime="987.208" offset="4095664">Of course, the prerequisite for that is that he be enforcing Federal law, because we think that even though the section doesn't limit the identity of the officer who acts, it does limit the subject matter of what he's acting on, and by highlighting delay, and since one can rarely be late for any sort of appointment one hasn't made, the statute very clearly indicates that is making reference to an event that gives rise to a duty to take someone in front of a Federal judge and, in our view, that is only an arrest for a Federal crime, and as we say, that is also consistent with the historical background of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.337" offset="4276222">As to our second point, even if it were true that an arrest for a State offense starts the 6-our clock running, we think it would be wrong to conclude that a confession made more than 6 hours after the arrest necessarily must be suppressed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1640.017" offset="6706864">Then it makes even more sense to concede that it's limited by the language of a subsection in the very same section.</text>

            <text syncTime="1671.805" offset="6834028">I'm not saying that's totally unreasonable, but you're having to take liberties with the statute the same way the Government does.</text>

            <text syncTime="3090.395" offset="12508451">The Secret Service might end up being... losing the opportunity to interrogate if the DEA was negligent or lax in contacting them promptly, but that's an arrest by a Federal agency, and I would think 3501(c) even under the Government's interpretation would apply there, so you're always going to have that situation where you want a statute that encourages the initial arresting officers, if they're going to pass the investigation on to someone else, to call those people that they're going to pass it on to promptly.</text>

            <label>Mr. Miguel A. Estrada</label>
            <text syncTime="3167.712" offset="12817636">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.234" offset="12851804">Only a couple of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.853" offset="12858283">First, the concession that counsel read in our reply brief on the merits was made also in our reply brief at the cert stage, and we merely repeated it in our reply brief on the merits because he made the same argument in his brief on the merits that he made in his opposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.616" offset="12941352">At page 1 through 2 of our reply brief on the cert stage, we deal with his argument of any law enforcement officer with the following:</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.407" offset="12988477">"That claim, however, is irrelevant to our submission. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.109" offset="12999239">"We do not content that arrests by State officers cannot qualify under section 3501(c). "</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.780" offset="13025989">"Our contention, instead, is that the arrest, whether by Federal or State officers, must be for a violation of Federal law. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.850" offset="13054201">"Only such an arrest can sensibly be viewed as imposing upon the arresting officer the duty to bring such person before a magistrate or other officer empowered to commit persons charged with offenses against the laws of the United States. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.908" offset="13102475">That is from our reply brief at the petition stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.895" offset="13126403">Our second point is that the basis for a person having been taken into custody is often litigated in State and Federal courts, because claims that the arrest was made without probable cause are a means for seeking the suppression of physical evidence seized at the time the person was taken into custody, and as a result of that, as a matter of routine in Federal court, officers, State and Federal, are called on to explain what the basis for their conduct was at the time when it was taken, i.e., what law they thought was... what law they thought there was probable cause to believe was being violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.959" offset="13314694">Unless the Court has any other questions, we will rest on our briefs.</text>
