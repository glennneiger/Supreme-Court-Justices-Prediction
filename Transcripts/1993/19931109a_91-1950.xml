            <text syncTime="550.558" offset="2336039">I think it's very important to focus on the language of the Jones Act in adopting... in adopting the standard of the FELA.</text>

"</text>
            <text syncTime="596.872" offset="2521299">One of those statutes which extends and modifies the right of railway workers is section 1404 of the Judicial Code, which is a Federal transfer statute, which was passed explicitly by Congress to provide that FELA cases would be transferable under the same standards that had been judicially established under forum non conveniens.</text>

            <label>Mr. John F. Manning</label>
            <text syncTime="1864.290" offset="7590935">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.280" offset="7618834">I just wish to emphasize three points very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.148" offset="7630328">First, as this Court recognized in Miles v. Apex Marine, maritime tort law is now a field dominated by Federal statute, and this Court has looked repeatedly to the Jones Act in defining the tort remedies available to a maritime employee like respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.507" offset="7695739">The Jones Act, in turn, incorporates by reference the rights and remedies given to railway workers under the FELA, and this Court has repeatedly looked to FELA precedents in defining the scope of remedies available under the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.453" offset="7759582">Thus, the Mayfield case is highly relevant in this context, because there the Court held that under the FELA State courts are free to apply their own doctrine of forum non conveniens in FELA cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.444" offset="7815588">That... the Court said that the State courts are free to accept or reject the doctrine of forum non conveniens in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.799" offset="7848921">Thus, Mayfield is highly relevant here, and we believe that it disposes of the case both as to the Jones act claim and as to the unseaworthiness and maintenance and cure claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="1944.994" offset="7913704">The United States does not take a position on whether the doctrine of forum non conveniens would be available... would be a preemptive doctrine of Federal law in State courts, where foreign parties and events are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.719" offset="7960620">I would note, however, that the United States urges this Court to leave that question open.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.421" offset="7979428">We believe that the considerations in such cases may well be different, for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.907" offset="8001371">First, where foreign parties and events are involved, there may be, in addition to the considerations relied on by petitioner, considerations involving comity and reciprocity that implicate greater Federal interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.299" offset="8051004">Secondly, in the admiralty cases that have defined the doctrine of forum non conveniens going back to Willendson v. Forsoket in 1801 and the Ship Lerow in 1804, the doctrine was traditionally articulated in terms of its effect on foreign parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.861" offset="8117250">The Court would typically say, we have jurisdiction over this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.396" offset="8131356">However, we have... the trial court has discretion to decline to hear the case because foreign parties are involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="2402.210" offset="9742589">The Government suggests that the last situation you describe could be handled by leaving open the possibility of a separate rule for cases where you have foreign defendants or plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.784" offset="9796924">What do you think?</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.802" offset="9808940">Would you like half a loaf rather than none?</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.338" offset="9823151">Is there something wrong with that proposal?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas J. Wagner</label>
            <text syncTime="2425.473" offset="9835690">There's something terribly wrong in principle with that, and that is, it's the anathema of the general maritime law, and how do we divide that?</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.896" offset="9861394">Does the American defendant get the nod over the foreign plaintiff?</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.948" offset="9877590">Does the American plaintiff get the nod over the foreign defendant, and how foreign?</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.883" offset="9893263">Do we then dissect this?</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.335" offset="9899115">The whole beauty... beauty, the mastery of forum non conveniens is, is that it is discretionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.822" offset="9928999">It puts in the power of the trial judge, the person who will have to decide what's convenient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.725" offset="9948643">In Markozannes we had doctors testifying from Greece by phone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.027" offset="9965884">The whole point of this is, that trial judge who faces these very critical issues of what's fair and is not fair is able to say, this case is in a patently inconvenient forum, and like the Federal system I will dismiss this conditioned upon, Mr. Defendant, you not raising procedural or limitation objections and going forward in the proper forum of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.727" offset="10060656">That's the mastery, that is the effectiveness of this tool.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.031" offset="10081868">It complements this broad, broad breadth of admiralty jurisdiction, whether it be obtained in rem, whether it be by writ of foreign attachment, whether it's salvage or personal injury, it puts in the hands of the trial judge the ability, discretionary, to say, this is a fair forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.312" offset="10170997">It accords the plaintiff an appropriate deference to his or her original selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.966" offset="10197642">That is entitled to great weight, and it ensures... it ensures that the alternate forum will have a suitable remedy, and then it weighs the questions of what's a convenient way to try this case, the convenience of the parties, the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.143" offset="10258351">In fact, I need to make this fundamental point clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.778" offset="10268904">In admiralty, this has never been a question of what the Solicitor General has called judicial housekeeping, or docket control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.033" offset="10297848">That's handy in a nonmarine setting, but in admiralty, it services the broad breadth of that jurisdiction, makes it effective, and makes it fair, and I respectfully submit that on that basis the decision of the Louisiana supreme court should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.960" offset="10365557">Thank you very much.</text>
