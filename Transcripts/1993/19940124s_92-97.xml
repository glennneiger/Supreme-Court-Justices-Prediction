            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="91020">I have the opinions of the Court in four cases to announce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4.875" offset="110455">The first is No. 92-97, Northwest Airlines versus the County of Kent, Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.096" offset="139399">This case involves a challenge to user fees charged by the Kent County that is Grand Rapids, Michigan Airport to commercial airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.081" offset="179314">The airlines contend that the fees are unreasonable and discriminatory under a Federal statute called the Anti-Head Tax Act and the Commerce Clause of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.196" offset="223722">They say that the airport should have allocated airfield cost to the concessions at the airport as well as to the flight operations and that the airport's failure to charge the general aviation a hundred percent of its allocated cost was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.164" offset="283595">The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that the airlines were entitled to bring a private action under the Act but rejected the airlines challenge to the fees in principal part.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.157" offset="335631">We assumed for the purposes that this case that the Act permits the airlines to commence this civil action and we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.692" offset="369694">In the absence of guidance from the Secretary of Transportation with ministers of the Federal aviation laws, we apply reasonable standards used in prior cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.324" offset="416297">Under these standards and in an opinion authored by Justice Ginsburg, we conclude that the fees should be left undisturbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.297" offset="448166">Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
