            <text syncTime="1532.897" offset="6280333">The second issue is whether the Secretary's rule is an unreasonable construction of the terms of the regulation itself under this Court's deference rules in Chevron and Udall v. Tallman.</text>

            <text syncTime="1995.258" offset="8129698">First of all, the prospective payment system was put in place, which put a very severe limit on the reimbursing available for ordinary medical services, and this created tremendous financial pressure on the hospitals and on the medical schools to find alternative sources of funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.311" offset="8193959">But medical education was still being reimbursed on a reasonable cost basis up through the base year in 1985, so there was... and other sources of funding were drying up, costs were rising.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.031" offset="8240875">Basically the costs and the sources of funding were on a collision course with each other, so medical schools started to bring in accounting firms to audit their books and try and ferret out new costs that could be shifted to Medicare under the rubric of education costs.</text>
