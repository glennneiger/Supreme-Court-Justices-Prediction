            <text syncTime="185.712" offset="897453">Well, I don't think so, not even under those circumstances, although that's not this case, Justice Kennedy, because I think that if in fact, as a matter of legislative accommodation, a group of individuals residing in a particular geographic area would warrant having a separate public school for secular reasons, which is what happened in this case, it would be permissible to accommodate to them, and... or even to accommodate to their religious practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.464" offset="1020437">Our view is that accommodation by the legislature to the needs of a religious community is permissible.</text>

            <text syncTime="228.781" offset="1069757">There's a code that talks about trash disposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.963" offset="1078429">If a community, for example, said, we will not accept trash disposal on the Sabbath, on Saturday... we think it's inappropriate for religious reasons... if the legislature then said, all right, for that reason we'll allow you to conduct your own trash disposal on some other day of the week, and you do it yourself, we think that's within the spirit of what the free exercise laws--</text>

            <text syncTime="250.876" offset="1158051">Well, Mr. Lewin, if... if such a law were to neutrally extend to everybody in New York, so that anybody similarly situated could dispose of their own trash, I think you have a very good argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.676" offset="1213326">I have a little trouble seeing why the same analysis applies when the law that you're examining is not neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.189" offset="1243314">It's just limited to this one situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.871" offset="1254077">It isn't a broadly based law that says people living in a village can have their own school district, whoever they are, whether they're this group or some other group, and yet it seems that New York has chosen to do this quite separately, so I hope you will address that aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.062" offset="1322831">One other question, preliminarily.</text>

            <text syncTime="399.783" offset="1753747">Is it part of the record in this case that the village district upon which the school district was superimposed was... was defined geographically by reference to the religious affiliation of the people in it, so that non-Satmar Hasidim were excluded, and those within the village all fell within the category of the Satmar sect?</text>

            <text syncTime="431.816" offset="1881851">The record establishes that what happened in this case... and it appears in the very first pages of the Joint Appendix... that what happened in this case was that the original village that was proposed... and that's at page 12 of the Joint Appendix... the Satmars presented a petition to form a new village of very large dimensions which included many properties and people not of the Satmar belief, so that consequently the original petition was not in any way limited by where Satmar Hasidim happened to live.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.795" offset="2001806">What happened, the real basis for the creation of the village was a zoning dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.927" offset="2018315">Since Satmar Hasidim have large families... indeed, I think the record shows there's over 60 percent of the population is under 17 years of age, they needed homes which would accommodate larger families, and that precipitated, as I say, a zoning dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.977" offset="2078501">The consequence ultimately was, as page 13 of the Joint Appendix shows, that a new village on a much smaller scale than originally proposed was presented only because the people who were to be included in the larger area said they did not want to be in this village, so that the--</text>
