            <text syncTime="8.305" offset="124124">This case comes to us from the Supreme Court of the State of South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.214" offset="147843">During the penalty phase of petitioner's State Court trial, the state argued that future dangerousness was a factor for the jury to consider in deciding between the death penalty and life imprisonment for the murder of an elderly woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.477" offset="216807">Petitioner in rebuttal presented evidence that his future dangerousness was limited to elderly women.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.910" offset="246586">The court refused to give the jury petitioner's proposed instruction that under state law he was ineligible for parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.177" offset="279605">The court instructed the jury not to consider parole in reaching their verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.628" offset="305414">A death sentence was returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.053" offset="315132">The Supreme Court of South Carolina ruled that the instruction satisfies in substance petitioner's request for a charge on ineligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.788" offset="354106">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, that judgment is reversed and the case is remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.306" offset="376154">The opinion I have written is only a plurality and is joined by Justices Stevens, Souter, and Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.379" offset="404470">We would hold that due process requires that the sentencing jury be informed that the defendant is parole ineligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.136" offset="435504">The Trial Court's instruction did not satisfy petitioner's request for a parole ineligibility charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.347" offset="472389">Justice Souter has filed a concurring opinion in which Justice Stevens has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.506" offset="496944">Justice O'Connor, joined by the Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy, concluded that where the state puts a defendant's future dangerousness at issue and the only available alternative sentence to death is life imprisonment without parole, then due process entitles the defendant to inform the sentencing jury that he is parole ineligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.167" offset="587641">Justice Ginsburg has filed a concurring opinion, and Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Thomas has joined.</text>
