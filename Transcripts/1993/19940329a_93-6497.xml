            <text syncTime="3188.246" offset="12896403">I want to correct something that I said in response to a question that Justice Scalia asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.964" offset="12919181">We did not specifically request in our letter to... the State court did not request appointment of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.507" offset="12945408">We asked that we be allowed time to recruit volunteer counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.303" offset="12960559">There was a pro se motion that was presented to the judge requesting a stay and time to obtain counsel, but I don't... that is not in the record, and I don't believe it specifically asked for appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.282" offset="13008520">The appointment system in Texas is... really varies on a county-by-county basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.076" offset="13031717">Nowhere in Texas does the State provide funds for indigent defendants, either at the trial level or at the postconviction habeas level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.948" offset="13067139">All of that is done by counties, and some judges take the position that they do not have the authority to provide counsel in habeas, and that was the position of the judge in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3256.627" offset="13169852">We were faced with the same dilemma in State court that we were faced with in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.013" offset="13199423">The district attorney, just like the Attorney General's Office, did agree not to oppose a stay if Mr. McFarland filed a perfunctory petition, but the judge made it quite clear that he would not allow time for counsel to be recruited in order to amend that petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.896" offset="13282910">He made it quite clear that he would not appoint counsel to represent Mr. McFarland on that petition, and when it was explained to him that we could not, unless we had additional time, he made it quite clear that we would not be allowed to substitute counsel even if volunteer counsel was found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.390" offset="13348948">So it is not quite so simple to say that they agreed not to oppose a stay, just as the Attorney General's Office agreed not to oppose a stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.556" offset="13389594">They were unable to agree... they were unable to assure us in any way that the judge would appoint counsel, and in fact the judge said he would not.</text>
