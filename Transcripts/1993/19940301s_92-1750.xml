            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="91477">I have the opinion of the Court to announce in Fogerty versus Fantasy, Inc.</text>
            <text syncTime="4.468" offset="109345">This case involves a dispute over the proper standards for awarding attorney's fees to successful litigants in copyright actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.268" offset="144453">The petitioner, Fogerty a musician, successfully defended a copyright infringement action brought against him by the respondent here and he then filed a motion for attorney's fees under the relevant provisions of the Copyright Act which provides that the court may award a reasonable attorney's fee to the prevailing party as part of the cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.441" offset="229195">The District Court in Los Angeles denied the motion for fees and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld that ruling because under the Ninth Circuit's rule known as the dual standard, prevailing copyright defendants such as Fogerty must show that the original infringement suit was frivolous or brought in bad faith in order to receive fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.331" offset="320728">But prevailing plaintiffs are generally awarded such fees as a matter of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.058" offset="339640">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we hold that prevailing plaintiffs and prevailing defendants must be treated alike under Section 505.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.100" offset="375794">The language of the Section gives no hint of any basis of a distinction and the other arguments in favor of the dual standard, we disapprove.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.225" offset="416336">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is, therefore, reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.265" offset="428457">Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
