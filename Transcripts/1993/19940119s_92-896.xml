            <text syncTime="9.145" offset="127594">The petitioner, Thunder Basin Coal Company, is what its name implies a coal mining company.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.560" offset="161240">Its workforce is non union but that force designated two employees of the United Mine Workers, to serve as miners' representatives under a statute, which is in 30 U.S. code section 813(f).</text>
            <text syncTime="37.717" offset="241802">The company refused to post information about this as required by a Department of Labor Regulation and instead it files suit in District Court and obtained an injunction preventing the enforcement of the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.049" offset="307212">The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.216" offset="319856">It held that the District Court jurisdiction was precluded by the administrative review scheme of the Mine Act, which provides for a review commission and then further review by the appropriate Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.903" offset="378579">The company contends that requiring it to challenge the interpretation to the statutory review procedures violates the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.607" offset="417449">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.738" offset="437929">We hold that the Mine Act's review scheme precludes a District Court from exercising subject-matter jurisdiction over a pre-enforcement challenge to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.380" offset="488502">Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment and has joined therein by Justice Thomas.</text>
