            <text syncTime="57.569" offset="379808">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="73.600" offset="443965">This case is of enormous importance to the State of New York, indeed, to other States, and also to people in private business.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.285" offset="482730">I urge this Court to reverse our own court of appeals which found our system for taxing cigarette sales by Indian traders to non-Indians preempted by Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.523" offset="523690">It is indeed somewhat ironic that I must ask this Court to protect our State's fisc by reversing the determination of our court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.758" offset="556605">However, this Court's prior decision in Moe, Colville, and Potawatomi, sustained the State system as consistent with Federal law, and that is what the court of appeals said was not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.236" offset="606551">Indeed, when this Court remanded this very case to our State courts 2 years ago, I believe that it did so because you recognized that States may require both retail and wholesale Indian traders to assist in collecting taxes due on sales to non-Indians at reservation stores.</text>

            <text syncTime="152.911" offset="761196">Your Honor, the case before us narrowly focuses on the regulation of wholesalers, and not retailers, and what we are looking here is merely those aspects of the regulation that regulate the sale, or sales by wholesalers.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.025" offset="837682">In my opinion, those are very narrow, they are very limited, and the Court should look at the regulatory scheme only as it affects the respondents here, who are cigarette wholesalers.</text>

            <text syncTime="185.873" offset="893062">Yes, I think it's severable.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.174" offset="902257">I think the Court could indeed uphold even portions of the regulations on wholesalers and not others, and certainly this Court should only deal with wholesalers.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.090" offset="937888">The Solicitor General brings into his brief before this Court the way the regulations affect the retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.026" offset="965682">That's really not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.939" offset="973310">It was not briefed below.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.519" offset="979684">There's really no evidence in the record with respect to how the regulations affect retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.981" offset="997447">With respect to wholesalers, again, I think this Court could sever and find some of the regulations applicable, but I do want to emphasize that the regulations on the cigarette wholesalers are quite limited, and really only require a limited amount of record-keeping and in fact are quite consistent with the regulation of Indian traders that has been upheld by this Court in the Moe case and in the Colville.</text>

            <text syncTime="277.102" offset="1257940">However, we believe that virtually all Indian stores sell both to Indians and to non-Indians.</text>

            <text syncTime="376.640" offset="1656151">As I indicated before, if I may, the court of appeals makes two basic mistakes in its reading of this Court's teachings in the Moe and Colville and Potawatomi cases, two basic flaws which are fundamental to the court of appeals decision which is before Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.772" offset="1736608">If you look at A12 in the appendix to our petition, I will read from there, and they say the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.855" offset="1765029">They say... they contend that inasmuch as the Supreme Court approved the imposition of precollection and record-keeping requirements on Indian retailers in those cases, the State can lawfully impose them on wholesalers, who are just one step further back on the distribution chain.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.707" offset="1828350">Moe and Colville involved burdens placed on Indian retailers dealing with non-Indians rather than on wholesalers dealing with Indians, a significant difference, and that is the major difference why they hold that in fact the regulations here are impermissible with respect to the respondents, the wholesalers, but there is no distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.067" offset="1897836">They make a distinction between retailers and wholesalers for purposes of the Indian Traders Act, but if you go to the Indian Traders Act, you see that that is not a distinction made.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.693" offset="1932317">Now, it is clear in Colville, for instance, that in fact the Indian retailers in that case were, in fact, Indian traders under the Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.121" offset="1970038">They were in the same category as the wholesalers here.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.022" offset="1981637">This distinction the court of appeals makes that you can, in fact, burden retailers but you cannot burden wholesalers, otherwise you are preempted by the Federal law, that distinction is not found in the Federal law and should not be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.072" offset="2033881">If you can regulate the retailers and have record-keeping requirements for the retailers, you can have those very same record-keeping requirements on the wholesalers.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.965" offset="2065437">The distinction they make is simply not found in Federal law, and it is nowhere found in the precedents of this Court, and again, I would suggest that the reason that this Court sent the case back to New York suggesting that the court look at Potawatomi, is that this Court recognized that that distinction between retailers and wholesalers really makes no sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="700.331" offset="2950884">We don't see any reason why it would be a prolonged process, and in fact the tax department regulations contemplate a very generous supply of tax-free cigarettes to the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.978" offset="2989441">You see, the problem now is not that there's a little bit of evasion going on, there's a huge amount of evasion going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.860" offset="3017026">It's costing the State $100 million a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.501" offset="3027579">The tax department's not looking to make sure that every single package of cigarettes that's untaxed is not... that no package of cigarettes untaxed is sold to a non-Indian, but what we have here is that the reservation sales even 6 years ago... even 6 years ago was over 30 times the estimated demand by Native Americans on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.088" offset="3117963">We're talking about massive evasion costing the State over $100 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.069" offset="3133846">So once these estimates are made, it is anticipated that there will be more than enough tax-free cigarettes flowing from the wholesalers like the respondents here onto the reservation, and it will not be necessary to go down and check each sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.858" offset="3192987">Furthermore, the alternative to this system would be far more intrusive, because if you had an alternative of only collecting the tax from the Indian retailers and leaving the wholesalers alone, think of what that would require.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.149" offset="3246172">That would require going in and auditing all of these retailers... and you know how much the Indians resent intrusion by outsiders on the reservation... coming into each of the Indian smoke shops, checking all of their books and sales to see how many tax-free cigarettes they sold--</text>

            <text syncTime="799.643" offset="3348154">I myself think that some of the problems that you addressed in the Potawatomi case ensued, and you will recall, Your Honor, that in the Potawatomi decision, you indicated that if there were problems collecting from the retailers, or going after the retailers, you suggested you can well go after the wholesalers, and I think that was a recognition that going after the retailers is a difficult thing to do and is a very intrusive thing to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.804" offset="3460794">And I am not suggesting here that in fact that if the burden was placed on the retailers it would necessarily violate the Indian Traders Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.937" offset="3489320">What I am suggesting, however, that this is a much less intrusive way of dealing with this problem... creating a realistic assessment, or allotment of tax-free cigarettes to go into the reservation, then providing for the wholesalers to be able to sell that inventory without tax stamp.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.952" offset="3569359">The remainder of the inventory that the wholesalers have would bear the tax stamps, would have the prepayment of taxes attached to them, and by... and then having a system down the line that allows for the wholesalers to distribute the tax-free cigarettes to the retailers based on these coupons that the Department of Taxation would issue to the retailers, who would then present them to the wholesalers.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.538" offset="3663713">We are looking now at how much this burdens the wholesalers.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.828" offset="3672908">All they have to do is get sufficient inventory to meet the tax-free demand, wait for the retailers to come to them with the coupons, and then record the tax-free transactions and the taxable transactions, and obviously on the taxable transactions remit the advance payment of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.831" offset="3744902">From the point of view of the Attea Brothers, this is not a complicated or burdensome system, and the court of appeals was simply wrong when it suggested that there were significant burdens imposed on respondents by this system, and again, as I mentioned when I answered Justice Ginsburg's questions, the court of appeals was certainly wrong when they said that this somehow limits the number or quantity of goods available on the Indian reservations.</text>

            <text syncTime="993.182" offset="4122319">Again, I say that there are tens of thousands if you will, maybe hundreds of thousands of individuals, who are evading their tax obligation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1529.254" offset="6266554">Both of those cases held that trade with Indians is preempted by the Federal Indian trader laws, and that there is no room whatsoever for any additional or supplementary State burdens on trade with Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.773" offset="6320680">One factual matter that is important to stress is that the respondents are wholesale distributors whose only sales on reservations in New York are to Indians... Indian retail vendors that purchase from us pursuant to the Indian trader laws and regulations which we must comply with with respect to all of those transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.350" offset="6422975">It is a separate and distinct transaction from the subsequent retail sales of which my learned colleague complains, and it is our view that this Court has sustained in the Moe, Colville, and Potawatomi cases, reasonable, minimal burdens on retail transactions between an Indian vendor and a non-Indian customer who comes on the reservation, but that the Court has made it very clear in Warren Trading Post and Central Machinery that no burdens whatsoever may be imposed on the sale to an Indian, and that's the business we have.</text>

            <text syncTime="2670.501" offset="10831609">First, they're preempted by Federal Indian trader statutes which occupy the field; second, the State regulations are preempted because they conflict with the Indian trader statutes in the implementing regulations; and third, the State regulations are invalid under the Court's reasoning in Moe and Colville.</text>

            <text syncTime="3245.410" offset="13131220">The Warren case dealt with tax, State tax on gross income of a corporation selling goods at retail to Indians on an Indian reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.877" offset="13169046">That's completely different, and not related to what's happening here, and what illustrates that best, Mr. Chief Justice is... and I quote from the Moe decision...</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.152" offset="13210215">"The State's requirement that an Indian tribal seller collect a tax validly imposed on non-Indians is a minimal burden designed to avoid the likelihood that in its absence non-Indians purchasing from the tribal seller will avoid payment of a concededly lawful tax, since this burden is not, strictly speaking, a tax at all. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.924" offset="13289313">The argument that we are here taxing the Indian trader is simply not so, and it's... the Warren case and the Central Michigan case are completely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.023" offset="13333617">The tax also is not... it's not part of the price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.617" offset="13356082">If you look in the appendix at page A46 you'll see that the tax has to be added to the price, but it's not part of the price and we're therefore not affecting the price of goods, which is the province of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.513" offset="13407596">We are simply having the tax added to the price on the non-Indian purchaser, which is concededly valid under the Moe decision and the Colville decisions.</text>
