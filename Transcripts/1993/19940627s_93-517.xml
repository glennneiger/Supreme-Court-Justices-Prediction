            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="12.602" offset="142008">This case is in fact three consolidated Establishment Clause cases which come to us on certiorari to the Court of Appeals of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.410" offset="173251">They require us to decide the constitutionality of New York statute creating a special school district for the Village of Kiryas Joel.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.560" offset="205851">Kiryas Joel was once part of the Town of Monroe New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.702" offset="218390">It was and still is a neighborhood composed entirely of Hasidic Jews who are members of a sect called the Satmar.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.545" offset="245766">In 1977, the Satmar neighborhood became separately incorporated as the Village of Kiryas Joel in accordance with the New York statute designed to allow almost any neighborhood within an existing town to incorporate its own village.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.048" offset="299788">But the Village of Kiryas Joel remains part of Monroe-Woodbury Central School District until the legislature pass the statute we review today.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.364" offset="337091">That statute sets up a school district with all the normal powers to collect local property taxes and operate public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.065" offset="363840">But unlike in normal school district, this one incorporates only the Village of Kiryas Joel and is thus, unusually small and uniquely homogeneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.796" offset="398740">The range of services the school district offers is also unique because almost all children in Kiryas Joel attend private religious academies.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.851" offset="431027">The village's only public school is one solely for handicap children and it has only 40 full time students.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.788" offset="458717">The State Supreme Court for Albany County decided that the statute creating the special school district violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.750" offset="490586">The appellate division and finally the States Court of Appeals agreed that the statute was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.288" offset="512738">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we affirm the judgment of the highest New York Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.104" offset="536039">The Establishment Clause compels the state to pursue a course of neutrality towards religion favoring neither one religion over others nor religious adherence generally over non-adherence.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.247" offset="576581">The portion of my opinion that speaks for the Court explains that when the state gave the benefits of a special little school district to only one religious group, it violated this command of neutrality.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.981" offset="615556">The statute applies just to the Satmars of Kiryas Joel.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.965" offset="627468">It provides no means by which another religious group or a non-sectarian group might obtain the same benefit, nor does the historically practice in the state give any indication that other applicants for small separate district would be treated as the Satmars were.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.404" offset="681175">Our history, in fact, suggests that they would not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.634" offset="694132">While the State of New York may do a number of things to address the educational problems of handicap children in Kiryas Joel, it may not provide this kind of special treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.665" offset="730286">A separate portion of my opinion joined by Justice Blackmun, Justice Stevens, and Justice Ginsburg explains the state's further problem of delegating political power to a group defined according to religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.950" offset="775425">The New York legislature purposely drew the school district in a way that made it all Satmar so that the Satmar community could effectively control public schools in its neighborhood.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.384" offset="813146">The Establishment Clause forbids a state to confer a civil authority on a group identified by law according to its religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.312" offset="840836">The group of local voters who threw their elected representatives run public schools in Kiryas Joel were impermissibly identified on the basis of their membership in the Satmar Sect.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.105" offset="883990">Justice Blackmun has filed a concurring opinion; Justice Stevens has filed a concurring opinion in which Justices Blackmun and Ginsburg join; Justice O'Connor has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment; Justice Kennedy has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment on the ground that the state may not use religion as a criterion to draw up political or electoral lines; Justice Scalia dissents, and the Chief Justice and Justice Thomas have joined his dissenting opinion.</text>
