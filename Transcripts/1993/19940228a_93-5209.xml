            <text syncTime="57.868" offset="380893">The district court's refusal to consider the constitutional claims in this case had a profound effect on the sentence that was imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.035" offset="413494">If any one of the three prior convictions had not been counted for enhancement, Mr. Custis would have been facing a sentence of 10 years, maximum, in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.064" offset="453618">Counting the three prior convictions increased the statutory maximum from 10 years to life in prison, and also triggered a mandatory minimum penalty of 15 years in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.198" offset="506176">The actual sentence of nearly 20 years that was imposed was nearly double the statutory maximum that would have been otherwise authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.242" offset="546405">The court of appeals recognized that some constitutional claims must be considered during sentencing enhancement proceedings under the Armed Career Criminal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.221" offset="590290">The Government also concedes that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.094" offset="601784">The issue presented is which constitutional claims should be considered at sentencing enhancement proceedings under the ACCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.108" offset="633863">Our position is that violation of the right to effective assistance of counsel in entry of an unknowing and involuntary plea are constitutional errors similar in magnitude to the Gideon violations which this Court has recognized cannot be used to support enhanced punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.929" offset="705125">I'd like to cover three points.</text>

            <text syncTime="143.333" offset="722679">Ms. French, to what extent do you think our decisions in Federal habeas, where a State defendant is raising a constitutional claim such as the Boykin type claim, the Parke v. Raley case, to what extent are those either informative or controlling in this context?</text>

            <text syncTime="169.338" offset="826751">Generally, I don't believe that the habeas corpus principles would be directly applicable, but there are some principles that might inform the Federal district court's consideration of these challenges.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="182.521" offset="879518">Do you think this is... we're dealing here with the question of the intent of Congress, or whether, regardless of congressional intent, it simply couldn't authorize these priors to be considered without having satisfied itself in some way that there was no constitutional violation in connection with them?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mary_french" startTime="200.669" stopTime="218.866">
            <label>Ms. Mary French</label>
            <text syncTime="200.669" offset="952034">I think our primary argument is that the Constitution requires that these claims be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.152" offset="973977">In terms of the statute, it doesn't authorize challenges or prohibit challenges, but if you look at the backdrop against which it was enacted, the Federal courts had been allowing challenges for a number of years.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="218.866" stopTime="233.375">
            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="218.866" offset="1024864">Well, if you're going to make any challenge based on statutory construction, really, logically that ought to be your first line.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.050" offset="1057569">We ordinarily don't reach a constitutional question unless we find it necessary to do so.</text>

            <label>Ms. Mary French</label>
            <text syncTime="233.375" offset="1082855">That's true, Your Honor, and our position on the statute is that at the time it was enacted, it was enacted against a backdrop of decisions including this Court's decisions in Burgett v. Texas and United States v. Tucker.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.230" offset="1134264">We are not arguing that the statute itself authorizes challenges, but we are... our position is that because of that backdrop, if Congress had wanted to abrogate Federal court review of prior convictions, then it would have made that intent express, and so that is our position on the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.253" offset="1210437">Established principles forbid the imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence based on prior convictions that are obtained in violation of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.842" offset="1260801">This Court in Burgett v. Texas ruled that a prior uncounseled conviction cannot be used to support guilt of another offense, and the Court's reasoning in Burgett was essentially that to use a conviction in that manner would erode the original constitutional right and would also force the defendant to suffer anew from that violation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="300.598" stopTime="305.408">
            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="300.598" offset="1351812">Do you think that makes much sense, that line of reasoning?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mary_french" startTime="305.408" stopTime="356.450">
            <label>Ms. Mary French</label>
            <text syncTime="305.408" offset="1371038">I think it does, Your Honor, because if you look at the opinion of the court of appeals and of the district court in this case, essentially what those courts held is that it simply does not matter if the defendant... if the defendant's prior conviction resulted from a constitutional violation, and therefore they would require that the district court ignore any constitutional violations that took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.101" offset="1469781">And so in that sense, doing that would erode the original constitutional right, and in terms of the defendant suffering anew, I think it's clear in this case, because of the direct impact that counting the prior convictions had, that it clearly increased the statutory maximum as well as invoked a mandatory minimum, so for those reasons, that reasoning would apply in this situation.</text>

            <label>Justice Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="356.450" offset="1575211">Ms. French, why isn't it reasonable to say, yes you can attack convictions on the grounds that you're asserting, but you must do so where they are rendered, not concern another forum many years later that doesn't have the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.100" offset="1633830">Why can't this be regarded as a "where" question, not "whether"?</text>
            <text syncTime="376.707" offset="1656191">Yes, you can attack a conviction on these grounds, but you can do it on direct attack, you can do it on collateral attack in the State where it was rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.830" offset="1688687">Why isn't it reasonable for Congress to say, you have those other avenues of attack open, we don't have to give you yet another?</text>

          <turn speaker="mary_french" startTime="394.090" stopTime="438.698">
            <label>Ms. Mary French</label>
            <text syncTime="394.090" offset="1725781">Your Honor, Congress has not actually said that, but the problem with it... there are a number of problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.713" offset="1752217">One is that actually in Maryland the Maryland courts have invited other jurisdictions to examine the constitutional validity of prior convictions obtained in Maryland that other jurisdictions would like to use for sentencing enhancement, and Maryland has specifically said that they will not review those convictions in that manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.642" offset="1831943">Often a defendant, by the time the prior conviction is being used against him for sentencing enhancement, he has no avenues for State relief at that point, and so he would not be able to bring a State post conviction, and with respect to the types of claims that we're alleging here, he probably would have had no opportunity to--</text>

            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="438.698" offset="1904145">Would you clarify this, because it may be relevant: whether under Maryland law any or all of the claims your client now wishes to make could have been litigated, either on direct review in Maryland, or on some kind of postconviction review?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mary_french" startTime="458.269" stopTime="491.145">
            <label>Ms. Mary French</label>
            <text syncTime="458.269" offset="1982512">--The ineffective assistance of counsel claims are not generally reviewable on direct appeal in Maryland, and that's because the record is not normally developed enough for the court of appeals to review that violation, and the same is true as to the claim of an unknowing and involuntary plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.651" offset="2064015">However, Mr. Custis could have brought a post conviction action with respect to the 1985 conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.335" offset="2094735">He could not have brought one with respect to the 1989 conviction because he was never in custody.</text>

            <text syncTime="749.494" offset="3147365">One I think is that the issues which here are ineffective assistance and unknowing and involuntary plea were not actually litigated in the prior proceeding, and there would have been no possibility of litigating them during those proceedings, because the violations actually took place during those proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="819.762" offset="3428442">The only reason why the conviction is still good in Maryland is because there's no opportunity to pursue relief there, so that would be why the prior conviction, even though it's not technically overturned in Maryland, should not be used for sentencing enhancement in the Federal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.021" offset="3505451">I would also just note that normally a guilty plea is not a valid and final judgment under collateral estoppel law, and in Maryland there's no nonmutual collateral estoppel in criminal cases, so for all those reasons, I don't think full faith and credit would be applicable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1009.685" offset="4188188">It had not been overturned in the jurisdiction where it was obtained, so that it would be incumbent on the defendant to come forward and have that actually reversed, and so I don't think that that distinction was intended to limit or draw the line on which claims could be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.507" offset="4263420">It's true that if it's a jurisdictional defect, then it would be deemed void and not just voidable, but the constitutional claims that are brought in Federal sentencing proceedings have never been limited in that fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.138" offset="4329980">In fact, I would just note that Burgett referred to other constitutional errors prior to stating the holding, there was some discussion about other constitutional errors that are applicable or constitutional rights that have been applied to the States that would be considered limitations on State court sentencing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1125.608" offset="4651809">In that instance, that error is not considered structural, and it would be subject to harmless error analysis, but it would be deemed to be harmful, and therefore the resulting conviction would be unreliable, and that's an error that should be recognized in Federal sentencing proceedings under the ACCA.</text>

            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>
            <text syncTime="1625.015" offset="6649445">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.451" offset="6671179">If I could first address the question raised by Justice O'Connor, I believe, as to whether there were any remedies at any point or would be now with respect to the two prior convictions in the Maryland courts or in the Federal habeas courts, I think the answer is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.992" offset="6729379">The first conviction was a 1985 conviction for which the defendant was given 8 years... I believe 5 years in custody and a 3-year probationary term to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.674" offset="6776086">That 8 years was still running at the time that he was arrested and charged in this case, and in fact if I... although this was not a matter that was made a part of the discussion in the lower courts, nonetheless the presentence report indicates that he was charged with violation of probation based on what happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.602" offset="6879845">His probation was violated in the 1985 case, so he would, given Maryland habeas law, which is effectively equivalent to Federal habeas law, he would have been able, even at that point, to go into the Maryland courts and challenge his 1985 conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.655" offset="6968034">The... of course he would have been able to challenge that conviction at the time, either on direct appeal or immediately thereafter on habeas if he wanted to raise the ineffective assistance of counsel claim which was raised with respect to the 1985 conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.147" offset="7042013">With respect to the other conviction, the 1989 conviction, we do not understand the claim ever to have been a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.096" offset="7077748">That wasn't the claim that was raised in the district court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.017" offset="7093422">The claim that was raised in the district court in this case was essentially a Boykin claim, although based principally on State law, but in any event, that... although the sentence that was given in that case was a noncustodial sentence, nonetheless, that conviction could have been appealed immediately in the Maryland courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.291" offset="7166565">Neither of these two convictions was appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.368" offset="7178895">Both of them were... well, one of them was a guilty plea conviction, the other was a conviction obtained on what's called the stipulated facts, a plea of not guilty with stipulated facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1769.691" offset="7228109">Mr. Bryson, isn't it probable that most of these cases are going to be challenges to guilty pleas?</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1774.300" offset="7246604">Because there are so many of them, so the real question is, can you expect the defendant to immediately appeal from a guilty plea?</text>

          <turn speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="1779.921" stopTime="1831.916">
            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>
            <text syncTime="1779.921" offset="7269069">Well, Your Honor, a lot of defendants do appeal from guilty pleas, particularly if they don't like the sentence, but the real question is, if something has gone terribly wrong, at least you can expect the defendant either to appeal immediately or to come back with a State habeas or Federal habeas action challenging the guilty plea at some point if he's dissatisfied with the disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.444" offset="7363215">The irony here is that the reason guilty pleas are typically not challenged is because of the reason that they're tendered, is because the defendant really doesn't have any quarrel, or at least understands that he doesn't have any legal quarrel with the State's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.157" offset="7422042">The basic principle that this Court has recognized again and again is that if you are pleading guilty, if you're talking about the guilty plea case, in the vast majority of cases you're talking about somebody as to whom there is no serious question of guilt.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1831.916" offset="7477108">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.150" offset="7477944">In a vast majority of those cases, there won't be any basis for a challenge, either, because the record normally shows that the normal procedures were followed, but the problem I suppose we have is in the case, the rare case where a defendant does come in with a transcript that shows a very plain violation of his constitutional rights, and your suggestion is that should simply be ignored.</text>

            <text syncTime="1852.408" offset="7559028">The bottom line of our position is that even if the transcript shows something that would be... give him a reversal in a minute had he taken a direct appeal, that that can't be the subject of a collateral attack at the sentencing enhancement proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1928.472" offset="7863303">For instance, the Tumey case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.205" offset="7870199">You have a system in which the judges essentially are being paid piecework for convictions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3095.658" offset="12532011">I mean, there are cases in which you could have been assigned a lawyer, and you would still be prepared to say that you have been totally denied effective assistance, the lawyer's been disbarred, for example.</text>

            <text syncTime="3113.978" offset="12605259">No, Your Honor, I don't think it's a question of how incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.585" offset="12619783">I think the question would be whether the lawyer was really not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.646" offset="12635979">If the lawyer missed every day of trial after the arraignment, for example, just didn't show up, then the fact that you had a lawyer appointed for you is not to distinguish your case from a case in which somebody didn't have a lawyer appointed for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.126" offset="12681850">If you get into distinguishing between incompetence, serious incompetence, gross incompetence, then I think you have invited the kind of inquiry that we think the Constitution does not require, and that practical considerations would treat as being just an enormous burden on the sentencing process.</text>

            <text syncTime="3164.785" offset="12808491">Under our Malang decision, could he then in Federal habeas challenge one of his earlier convictions?</text>

            <text syncTime="3171.361" offset="12834823">Your Honor, our reading of Malang is that he could not, that those convictions he would not be in custody on those prior convictions, although there's language at the end of Malang that leaves open the question of just how you can challenge conviction A when you have been... when that has been used to enhance your sentence for conviction B.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.069" offset="12941716">If I may say one more word about the practical impacts and the burden of this, I think it is an increasing practice that we see increasing numbers of cases come in, and just recently I saw a case in which a defendant had 17 prior convictions and challenged every single one of them, and it is not limited... this problem is not limited--</text>

            <text syncTime="3243.816" offset="13124677">But if I can just make one further point, this is not a principle that... if this Court adopts the principle petitioner seeks, that's limited just to enhancement proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.923" offset="13161040">It would affect every sentencing proceeding in which somebody wants to use a prior conviction just as a factor going to whether the person should be sentenced in a particular way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.199" offset="13198238">It also would affect, I assume, whether a prior conviction can be used for impeachment, so that when a prosecutor stands up after the defendant has testified and says, I want to impeach this guy with his prior conviction, he would be able to say, oh, no, I had a bad lawyer, you can't use that, and you'd have to have a proceeding right there to decide whether or not the lawyer in that other case was ineffective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.939" offset="13293115">I think one other area in which the same practical problems would arise is probation revocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.280" offset="13322477">You've never been able to challenge your initial conviction in a revocation proceeding, but I assume that if the defendants are correct here, the defendant is correct, then you would be able to in a case like this.</text>

            <text syncTime="3309.056" offset="13385588">I'd just like to briefly point out that the court of appeals decisions are cited on pages 13 and 14 of our brief, and there are eight circuits that have uniformly allowed challenges under the ACCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.815" offset="13444625">I think that a number of the cases that Mr. Bryson was referring to arose under the Sentencing Guidelines, and there are different considerations under the Sentencing Guidelines, including the fact that there are departure provisions available, and there is also guidelines language that governed whether challenges were allowed, at least up until recently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.776" offset="13520485">Another difference between the guidelines and ACCA cases is that there is no increase in the statutory maximum in the guidelines context, where there is in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3370.687" offset="13632184">A Federal court's decision not to rely on the prior conviction for a sentencing enhancement would have no impact on those proceedings.</text>
