            <text syncTime="29.910" offset="265945">--Your Honor, I think that the answer is that this Court's decision in Freytag in 1991 caused a recognition that the Appointments Clause had ramifications beyond what people had considered it before.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.401" offset="328012">That is my understanding, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.404" offset="335953">I was not there when the issue was first raised, but that is my understanding.</text>

            <text syncTime="60.972" offset="390288">But the commissions that they received were commissions as military officers and not as judicial officers, and the question presented is whether that appointment satisfies the Appointments Clause for their judicial positions.</text>

            <text syncTime="113.587" offset="600731">And as Your Honor will note, in the addendum to our brief there are separate certificates appointing each of these persons to a judicial office, and that is why I use that particular term, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="144.240" offset="723297">That narrows the group of people from all of the officers in the military down to about 1,650 officers who are law officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.175" offset="767078">Of that, only 3 percent are either military trial judges or military appellate judges: 91 trial judges, and about 31 appeals judges.</text>

            <text syncTime="173.327" offset="839699">Well, but under your theory you have to be appointed to a specific office.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.423" offset="860074">Why isn't a legal officer a specific office so that a legal officer could not, say, take a command position or an officer position in the combat unit?</text>

            <text syncTime="188.517" offset="900407">The principal reason, Your Honor, and this is the heart of our argument, is that under the Uniform Code of Military Justice only certain people, those who are appointed as judges, can perform the major functions that judges perform in the military: presiding over general and, in most cases, special court-martials; deciding on whether evidence will be admitted; ruling on challenges for cause; instructing the jury; ruling on matters of... other matters that come before such as preliminary motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.606" offset="1016809">And most important of all, only a military judge can decide in a special or general court-martial the guilt or innocence of the accused and can pass sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="244.259" offset="1123389">Your Honor, I don't believe there's any statute governing the military that restricts what legal officers can do.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.692" offset="1145122">In fact, Your Honor, I am advised that persons who have the legal officer designation do perform other legal duties, and no one, except the judges, performs judging duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.358" offset="1191829">No one other than the 31 members of the Courts of Military Review sit and decide the appeals that come to them with the quite extraordinary powers of appellate jurisdiction in the military.</text>

            <text syncTime="2815.891" offset="11409887">That is, as the Court is aware, a civilian court, and it's designed to police the military justice system against incursions on the independence and impartiality of military judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.751" offset="11461400">Judges on the Court of Military Appeals serve for 15 years, and the chief judge has a 5-year term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.004" offset="11490344">That court has shown a willingness, since its creation, to address cases of bias in the military justice system in a very effective way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.981" offset="11530259">There has been some dispute in the briefs about Article 6(a) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which is a provision that allows for inquiring into the fitness of military judges and whether it came after the 1983 Military Justice Act legislation or at some other time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.466" offset="11616254">But I think it's important... and let us concede that it did come later on than 1983... that that provision was a response to what seemed to many a very courageous decision on the part of the Court of Military Appeals to resist an effort by the Secretary of Defense and the Inspector General of the Department of Defense to inquire into the accuracy and propriety of decisions that had been made by military judges in a specific case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.609" offset="11744776">What the Court of Military Appeals said was there cannot be that type of investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.664" offset="11765047">It has to be done pursuant to a commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.376" offset="11775810">In sum, Your Honors, neither the Appointments Clause nor the Due Process Clause is violated by the way in which the military staffs and operates its judicial system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.193" offset="11823144">It is a system created, directed, and monitored by Congress and the Commander in Chief of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.346" offset="11851774">We think that the decisions below should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.279" offset="11863477">Thank you very much.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan B. Morrison</label>
            <text syncTime="2934.676" offset="11885106">The Government's basic submission on the Appointments Clause issue is that military judges are no different from military officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.441" offset="11924081">We think that that is not what Congress meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.693" offset="11933171">That's not what Congress wrote in Article 26 and it's not what Congress enacted in specifying who can perform the function of military trial and appellate judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.960" offset="11966190">Second, in addition to the Coast Guard, the Navy has had civilians on the Courts of Military Review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.135" offset="11990850">None recently: I believe the last one was in the early 1970's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.225" offset="12003284">Third, while we dispute vigorously with the Justice Department the applicability of the de facto officer doctrine as it applies to direct appeals, we recognize that it may have considerable force in the context of habeas corpus or collateral attack, assuming that there was... that Teague itself did not prevent the overturning of military court-martials of many years.</text>

            <text syncTime="2994.556" offset="12124597">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.097" offset="12126791">And last, the Government talks on the due process issue about this time-honored practice, 200 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.643" offset="12156884">Well, we haven't had military judges for 200 years, so the time to start counting is 1968, and since that time that's the first time we've had anybody that has terms of office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.870" offset="12197844">What they forget, of course, is that the time-honored practice every place except in the military is for those persons who are performing judicial functions to have some term of office, to have some kind of protection about the very concerns that Justice Kennedy and others have spoken about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.232" offset="12263255">The Government says deference, deference, deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.975" offset="12278301">But it doesn't say deferent to what, other than the fact that they haven't done anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.159" offset="12295020">There's not a single reason advanced, a single military policy or military necessity that can form the basis of reliance on this deference, and for that reason we believe that due process, as well as the Appointments Clause, has been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.919" offset="12346011">We ask the Court to reverse the convictions.</text>
