            <label>Mr. David I. Bruck</label>
            <text syncTime="49.965" offset="350524">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="53.626" offset="365153">The issue in this capital case is whether the prosecution can secure a death sentence on the grounds of the defendant's future dangerousness, while at the same time concealing from the sentencing jury a crucial aspect of its noncapital sentencing alternative, namely that life imprisonment means life without parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.462" offset="456582">Future dangerousness was the primary reason advanced by the State in this case why the jury should sentence Jonathan Simmons to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.666" offset="493362">The defense acknowledged that the petitioner, by reason of his serious mental illness, was, in fact, dangerous or would be, in fact, dangerous were he released back into society.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.835" offset="542054">However, the defense showed, by expert and lay testimony, a likelihood that the petitioner would make a nonviolent and cooperative prison inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.512" offset="584686">Now, the jury itself identified the crucial piece of missing information in this presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.276" offset="611749">After 90 minutes of deliberation on the issue of penalty, the jury returned to the courtroom and asked the following question: Does the imposition of a life sentence carry with it the possibility of parole?</text>
            <text syncTime="128.134" offset="663262">And the trial judge responded by telling them three things: you are instructed not to consider parole; that is not a proper issue for your consideration; and life imprisonment and death sentence are to be understood in their plain and ordinary meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.586" offset="728987">The issue in this case arises because of the fact that under South Carolina law the correct answer to the jury's question was no.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.990" offset="766603">Because Jonathan Simmons had prior convictions for a violent offense, under South Carolina law life meant exactly that, life without the possibility of parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.788" offset="805891">That was what the jury wanted to know and that is what the petitioner urged they be told.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.191" offset="827416">The State, from the very beginning of the trial, successfully impressed upon the trial judge not to tell the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.127" offset="855210">It was obvious how critical this information was going to be and the... it was obvious what an advantage the State would receive if alone among everybody in the courtroom, the jury alone would be the only ones not to know.</text>

            <text syncTime="199.121" offset="947161">But here where there is absolutely no justifiable, there is no rational State interest in refusing to give the information that the jury asked for and where the information on the facts of this particular case was so crucial to a reliable and fair determination of the sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="228.109" offset="1063145">However, what the alternative to death is in a case where the State is basically saying... not basically, where the State is literally arguing to the jury this is a matter of self-defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.327" offset="1104000">That was Mr. Harpootlian's jury argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.528" offset="1112778">The question before you is what to do with someone who is a threat.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.371" offset="1376196">But in this case, in capital sentencing, the jury's task is to sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.705" offset="1393542">And, of course, the State cannot derive any comfort from the principle that sentencing issues shouldn't interfere with guilt in a proceeding which is a sentencing hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="324.394" offset="1448294">It boils down to the position that the jury should know the meaning of the terms, the meaning which the law gives to the terms that the jury is required to use in pronouncing the sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="336.682" offset="1497404">And most particularly our Gardner claim, our due process claim, is that even if the Eighth Amendment did not require an affirmative answer to that question, where the State puts the meaning of the noncapital sentencing so clearly into issue... and we know it was an issue not only because of the evidence and the solicitor's... the prosecutor's argument, but because of the jury's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.947" offset="1590505">There surely... leaving all this Court's Eighth Amendment jurisprudence to one side for a moment, there obviously it just isn't fair.</text>

            <text syncTime="1285.072" offset="5291011">But even... for purposes of our argument today and for purposes of deciding this case, even the fact that... if the judge were to instruct under current law, or subject to further action by the legislature, I don't think that that in any way affects our submission today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.621" offset="5353182">The State didn't want to get a fair hearing on this or spell out or clarify the definition of the definition of life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.718" offset="5397591">The State wanted to keep the jury in the dark and the State was successful in doing exactly that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.392" offset="5412219">And I submit that under the Due Process Clause on the facts of this case, under the reliability prong of this Court's line on this Court's Eighth Amendment cases, and we also submit under the Lockett-Skipper line of the right to present mitigating evidence and to have mitigating evidence given substantial and reasonable weight in the jury's deliberations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.115" offset="5499155">Because the failure to define the life imprisonment punishment rendered almost meaningless the defendant's Skipper evidence, his good behavior in prison evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.211" offset="5531547">What difference would it make if he's only going to be in prison for 5 or 10 years?</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.914" offset="5546384">We're concerned about what happens what he's paroled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.875" offset="5554221">And, indeed, the fact that he's a good inmate might actually, to the jury, make it more likely that he'll be paroled sooner and back on the streets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.139" offset="5579194">So for all of those reasons, we submit that what happened here cannot be squared with the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.293" offset="5607824">And I would note too that this is, in terms of what goes on around the country, a very narrow issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.798" offset="5633842">Because of the States which have parole, precious few of them try to put this sort of a thumb on the scales for death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.244" offset="5671667">They tell the jury forthrightly, in the overwhelming majority of States, and I believe it goes down the line of them, that if life means life, that is usually part of the sentencing verdict itself, and the jury is not left in the dark and defendants are not exposed to the sort of unfairness that happened in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3107.627" offset="12581160">The request is at page... pages 21 and 22 of the Joint Appendix, and it is simply that the judge read the no parole statute to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.015" offset="12618776">As an alternative when that was denied, we then requested, as very much second or third best, a more vague instruction about that he actually will be sentenced to serve life in the State penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.012" offset="12674782">But that was not the request we made and that is not the request upon which this case turns.</text>

            <text syncTime="3138.085" offset="12702995">At least to the extent that you asked for it, would you take the bitter with the sweet and concede that it would be appropriate to read some more instructions to the jury, some more statements of law to the jury, going into questions... the possibilities of furlough and work release and so on?</text>

            <text syncTime="3161.942" offset="12798498">I don't think the South Carolina Supreme Court will necessarily allow these... what are, in fact, very speculative and remote possibilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="3185.486" offset="12892644">And, of course, in this case it is not only... the chance of his being released on parole is not merely highly speculative but legally nonexistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.194" offset="12931514">The record actually shows that no life without parole inmate had ever been granted a furlough, and it goes on and one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.630" offset="12961189">Under the regulations they are not eligible for work release.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.583" offset="12972996">This long laundry list of 12 possibilities, if you look closely at the record, is actually vanishingly small.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.647" offset="12997238">And, yes, we are willing to take the bitter with the sweet, as a matter of Eighth Amendment law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.928" offset="13018449">Justice O'Connor inquired about the list of States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.961" offset="13030570">I would simply direct the Court's attention to pages 39 to 41 of our brief, that's footnotes 23 to 27, which gives in some detail exactly what all of the life-without-parole States have to say on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.439" offset="13084487">Finally, I would just note the issue... the history of this issue in South Carolina has been somewhat torturous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.733" offset="13101623">We describe it in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.944" offset="13106430">Shortly after life without parole became an option for recidivist cases, the State supreme court said that on the request of a defendant restrictions on parole should be charged, and that was the law until a month before this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.151" offset="13155331">This is the first case to be tried under the new regime of State v. Torrence which overruled that majority practice and said that from now on the jury should be left in the dark, and therefore I think it is at least fortuitous that this practice is a novel one and can and should, we submit, be nipped in the bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.593" offset="13221055">If there are no further questions, that's all we have.</text>
