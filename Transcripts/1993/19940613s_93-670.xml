            <text syncTime="8.330" offset="124239">In the course of loading or discharging cargo from maritime vessels, accidents can occur which injure longshoreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.867" offset="154436">The injuries as can be, as they were alleged to be in this case, serious and disabling.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.397" offset="172513">The two likely possibilities for compensation to the injured longshoreman are first, the ship owner, we say the vessel, and the second, the stevedore which is the longshoreman's employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.644" offset="221519">Before enactment of extensive 1972 amendments to the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act which is the statute that is involved in this case, the injured longshoreman could sue the vessel on a warranty of seaworthiness theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.534" offset="269062">Now, then the vessel could often turn around and sue against the stevedore seeking indemnity of contribution on the theory that the stevedore was negligent in its supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.234" offset="307932">Of course this, meant lots of resources were diverted to lawsuits instead of to the payment for the injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.219" offset="331860">The 1972 Act changed the scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.123" offset="339488">The Act provides that the stevedore is liable regardless of fault and it provides a generous schedule of benefits for workman's compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.347" offset="372298">Under Section 5(b) of the Act, however, the vessel is liable in a suit brought by the longshoreman if the vessel's negligence caused the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.091" offset="403331">In this case, we assume the facts to be true as the case follows a summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.507" offset="420990">The longshoreman, Mr. Howlett, sustained serious injuries when he slips on a deck covered with a plastic covering or overlay.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.712" offset="449829">He claimed the vessel was negligent because either one, a newly alleged dangerous condition or two, even if it did not it should have known that because it had a duty, according to Howlett, to inspect when the cargo was loaded at the foreign port.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.305" offset="504164">Now the Courts of Appeals are not in agreement as to the vessel's duty to inspect cargo operations in a foreign port and we took this case to decide among others at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.826" offset="550244">We hold that the vessel's duty to warn of latent defects in the cargo stow is a narrow one.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.988" offset="570933">The duty attaches only to latent hazards defined as hazards that are not known to the stevedore, and it would be neither obvious to nor anticipated by a skilled stevedore.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.660" offset="609594">Ship owners engage a stevedore for its expertise in cargo operations and are entitled to assume that a competent stevedore would be able to identify and cope with defects in the cargo stow.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.217" offset="647837">Furthermore, the duty encompasses only those hazards that are known to the vessel or should be known to it in the exercise of reasonable care.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.810" offset="674169">The exercise of reasonable care does not require the ship owner to supervise the ongoing operations of the loading stevedore or to inspect the completed stow.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.535" offset="709068">Though the precedents of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit are not necessarily in conflict with our holding, the decision in this case may have turned if I am not mistaken, assumptions as to the vessel's actual knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.738" offset="745953">We think the better course is to vacate and remand the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit for further considerations in light of the principles we have discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.621" offset="777404">Our opinion in this case is unanimous.</text>
