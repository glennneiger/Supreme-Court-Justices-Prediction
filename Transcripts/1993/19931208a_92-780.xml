            <text syncTime="54.988" offset="372258">Yes, it is, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.819" offset="375497">It's seeking to protect the rights of its women members.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.761" offset="387305">And in particular it's just seeking the injunctive relief, it's not seeking damages for those women.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.141" offset="404859">The clinics, of course, are seeking damages for themselves and all similarly situated clinics.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.556" offset="422518">Your Honors, this case involves forcible violent conduct by a highly structured enterprise called PLAN, an enterprise with a very clearly defined goal, to force every women's health center that offers abortion out of business by whatever means are necessary, including terrorist tactics.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.968" offset="492108">Our case arises under RICO, which doesn't say a word about economic motive, and the question before this Court is whether to apply the statute that Congress wrote or amend it judicially to add this unstated requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.336" offset="541636">I'd like to discuss three points this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.127" offset="552712">First, that the text and structure of RICO do not allow for an economic motive requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.130" offset="572774">Second, that to apply the statute as Congress wrote it easily comports with the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.504" offset="598269">And third, that an economic motive requirement would be bad policy in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.337" offset="617600">Starting with the text, we bring our case under section 1962(c) of RICO, which doesn't mention economic motive, and neither do the two terms where the lower court claimed to find this requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.195" offset="665038">Both "racketeering activity" and "enterprise" are terms that Congress expressly defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.119" offset="688758">They're terms that this Court has called broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.890" offset="699834">And in the Sedima case, this Court pointed out that "racketeering activity" consists of the commission of the predicate acts, no more and no less.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.416" offset="733897">And in H.J. the Court recognized that this generous definition would purposefully attract a broad array of perpetrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.761" offset="763259">We know that Congress did not want to limit racketeering activity to only those crimes that were economically motivated, because when Congress chose the 30-some-odd crimes to include in RICO as the predicate acts, it included numerous crimes that have no necessary relation to money at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.733" offset="831177">In fact, three of the first four, arson, kidnap, and murder, have no necessary relation to money.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.286" offset="853434">And none of the predicate acts is any less a crime if it's committed for some other reason like power, hatred, or revenge.</text>

            <text syncTime="188.044" offset="904425">The news the other night indicated there's a new theory about the Lindbergh kidnapping, and it's my suggestion that if it turns out that it was a relative who did it because of a spurned love affair, that would be just as much kidnapping as if it were Mr. Hauptmann who had done it for the ransom.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.993" offset="960222">The fact is that kidnapping doesn't require money.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.945" offset="972029">That's not an element of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.885" offset="979762">It sometimes includes it, it sometimes doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.238" offset="989166">Sometimes even organized crime, in terms of mobsters, kidnap people to protect their turf or to avenge an insult, or for some other reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="534.980" offset="2292154">It requires in section 1964(c) that for a plaintiff to come before this Court in a private case it must have been injured in its business or property.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.256" offset="2325277">Congress spelled that out right in the statute, unlike this missing motive requirement which doesn't appear anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.811" offset="2347533">And by the way, Justice Stevens, that economic effect is something that even the lower court recognized we unquestionably have, because this nationwide campaign of terror has caused and continues to cause enormous business and property damages to our plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.022" offset="2416392">Another reason that we should not infer an economic motive requirement into a statute that is totally devoid of one is RICO's liberal construction clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="583.554" offset="2486505">And as the Court pointed out in Russello, this is an unusual provision, particularly for a criminal statute, and it shows Congress' choice to be expansive, particularly in the remedial provisions of RICO's application.</text>

            <text syncTime="896.097" offset="3736620">For three reasons, RICO does not require a prosecutor or a plaintiff to prove an economic motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.572" offset="3762534">First, there is no textual basis for such a requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.613" offset="3778730">Second, this Court has already rejected similar nontextual limitations on the scope of RICO which were also claimed to derive from Congress' purpose in passing the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.662" offset="3826900">And third, the economic motive requirement is elusive and really has little to do with the societal effects of systematic ongoing crime, which is what the statute is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.740" offset="3875174">As to our first point, the respondents in this Court have not identified the single one textual home of the economic doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="1056.673" offset="4378919">The Court said nothing about what the nature of that purpose must be, and that's all the Court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.547" offset="4402429">And, in fact, as the lower courts have recognized, pinning this doctrine on the enterprise element would really cripple the role that Congress thought RICO would play.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.054" offset="4452480">It would take out of the reach of RICO Government entities, courts, nonprofit organizations, all of which have uniformly been recognized by the lower courts to be RICO enterprises, and which even Respondent Scheidler, I think, at page 14 of his brief concedes are RICO enterprises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.227" offset="4537117">In addition, one of this Court's cases, the H.J., Inc. case, had a Government agency as a claimed RICO enterprise, and that certainly gave no pause to the Court in ruling that the complaint in that case was sufficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="1148.561" offset="4746514">RICO takes a different tack, and it starts with conduct that is already criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.385" offset="4769816">And while Congress said that as to the civil side of RICO, it was looking to the antitrust model, this Court has recognized that that is not a model that the Court should follow in all contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.156" offset="4824882">For example, in the Sedima case a claim was made that based on the antitrust laws which called for some form of antitrust injury, there should be a requirement in RICO that there be racketeering injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.656" offset="4886844">And this Court turned down that argument, saying that racketeering activity is nothing more and nothing less than the commission of the predicate crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.052" offset="4928431">Thus while Congress did have the antitrust model of civil damages in mind, I don't think this Court has ever ruled that it... that every aspect of RICO is ruled by what Congress has done in the antitrust areas.</text>

            <text syncTime="1280.860" offset="5275651">Though we have not briefed the Hobbs Act issue, I should say that it is far from clear that nothing was obtained in this case, taking the claims in the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.483" offset="5366139">In the Green case, this Court essentially held that if I put a gun to your head and have you give your wallet to the first person who comes down the street, that is extortion under the Hobbs Act, even though I get nothing physically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.113" offset="5424758">And the reason for that has to be that because even though I have not myself obtained your wallet, I have obtained the right to control the disposition of your wallet which is, in itself, a property right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.725" offset="5487138">You have a right to give your wallet to whom you please, or even keep it yourself, and that's what you usually do all the time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1366.356" offset="5617646">Mr. Estrada, why I'm concerned about it is that the combination of that broad interpretation of extortion, plus the interpretation of RICO that the petitioners favor here, leaves one in a situation where any... any national organization which has adherents and hangers-on who may commit a tort, hitting someone with a picket sign or trespassing upon property, by committing an unlawful act can be charged with committing extortion even though they're not trying to get money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.747" offset="5755259">And this means that any... any national organization demonstrating for some political cause exposes itself to lawsuits nationwide... which they may win, but they may lose, but it's an enormous amount of expense... by people claiming that that is the very purpose of the organization, to extort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.058" offset="5816490">And it makes... if it were applied to the NAACP in the days of civil rights activism, it would have been very debilitating.</text>

            <text syncTime="1451.791" offset="5959432">However, the issue here is whether an economic motive doctrine should be implied to take that danger out of RICO.</text>

            <text syncTime="1613.136" offset="6604761">That's something that could not have been raised in the lower court simply because their lack of standing on RICO was not involved in their original petition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1711.741" offset="6999210">Let me answer the first part of your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.121" offset="7008718">The grant of cert... contrary to Ms. Clayton's position is we did not seek a grant of cert. What we merely pointed out in our brief was that if this Court took the RICO question, it would face necessarily the question of extortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.423" offset="7077995">And since we are respondents and not petitioners, we may defend the court below, the judgment of the court below, on any ground whether it was raised below or not, and in this case it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.609" offset="7122717">Our central and strongest argument is "no extortion".</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.742" offset="7143197">And there is no extortion in this case for two fundamental reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.345" offset="7157616">This statute, the Hobbs Act, was modeled on New York law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.660" offset="7182903">New York law was modeled on the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.211" offset="7193143">In 1865, the field code commentary carefully explained that the extortion provisions of that code was part of the property loss series: embezzlement, larceny, robbery and extortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.996" offset="7272242">Each requires a common law taking, a trespatory taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.007" offset="7288333">What is happening in this case is they are transposing a clear common law term, extortion, and making it into a modern statutory term, coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.297" offset="7341414">And they're doing that by taking the concept "property", which starts out to mean tangible property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.950" offset="7364088">You can interpret it to be intangible property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.283" offset="7377358">You can interpret it to be intangible rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.984" offset="7388225">And finally, the right is not obtained but the other is deprived of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.226" offset="7405153">That particular process of interpretation is not reading a statute, it is redrafting it.</text>

            <label>Ms. Fay Clayton</label>
            <text syncTime="3200.401" offset="12953874">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.776" offset="12975399">If I heard Mr. Blakey right, his argument began with the principle that the concept of illicit gain sums up the RICO statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.702" offset="13011030">I think in... Justice Ginsburg's question just a moment ago pointed out how inaccurate that statement really is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.965" offset="13040078">But I would also like to remind the Court and Mr. Blakey that in his 1980 article which is relied upon by Mr. Scheidler in his brief, he said... and more important, this Court has said on many occasion that Congress knew how to put a limitation in RICO when it wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.877" offset="13111758">And if Congress wanted to limit RICO to crimes done for illicit gain, two words would have solved the problem and we wouldn't see the quagmire of issues like Mr. Blakey has been forced to address this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.189" offset="13172989">The question... the argument that he makes raises so many questions that no one can answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.272" offset="13197336">Even the lower courts couldn't say... with all the various definitions they've come up with in Ivic, in Bagaric, which took away motive and gave dimension, it still doesn't answer the question of where we're supposed to look for this economic motive or dimension or gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.150" offset="13252820">Is it supposed to be in the crimes, in the enterprise, in the criminals themselves?</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.254" offset="13269225">Congress knew how to put limits in RICO, and as this Court said in Russello, the short answer is that Congress did not write the statute that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.551" offset="13306423">It could have... certainly it could have limited enterprises to business enterprises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.223" offset="13325127">It could have limited predicate acts to ones done for gain: murder for profit, arson for profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.985" offset="13344144">It didn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.907" offset="13347905">Affairs certainly doesn't imply the exclusion of illegitimate affairs any more... or noneconomic affairs any more than the arguments that this Court heard in Turkette made any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.663" offset="13394926">It just doesn't wash.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.995" offset="13400255">Mr. Blakey's reliance on the antitrust laws is mystifying to me, because the antitrust laws for more than three-quarters of a century have taught that good motives do not save illegal acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.414" offset="13449887">And all the authorities, his reference to antitrust cases, are entirely apart from this case, because each and every one of them involved either petitioning or protected lawful speech.</text>

            <text syncTime="3346.587" offset="13538599">What he's using them for is to show that in another area we have imported an extratextual limitation upon the statute.</text>
