            <text syncTime="1129.220" offset="4655603">And so the use of the word "related" we submit has a very broad meaning, but even if one used a very narrow meaning, Congress decided that the mechanism to get to cleanup was to allow private parties as well as the Government to enforce the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1429.778" offset="5857863">We do not contest that there is an implied cause of action under 9607 to recover contribution of costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.649" offset="5913347">And that was confirmed by Congress in adding a contribution provision in the 1986 amendments in 9613, but that does not itself provide the cause of action; it provides guidelines for the cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.280" offset="5991923">And Key Tronic has been paid its costs of the cleanup.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.767" offset="6021807">The issue here is its claim for attorneys' fees, not for other costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.341" offset="6044168">And if I may just amend one other factual point in petitioner's response to a question, we do refer to a consent decree that Key Tronic entered into at the bottom of page 3 and the top of page 4 in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.241" offset="6119714">Now, they did not explicitly admit liability, but they entered the consent decree which recounted actions that would have made them liable under CERCLA and actions of depositing hazardous wastes at the site, and this is consistent also with a jury trial that was earlier reached on the complaint of some neighbors that we refer to in footnote 2 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.181" offset="6239460">So there has been some adjudications with respect to liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.644" offset="6261298">Now, the... in our view, the issue in this case is controlled by the rule of this Court's decisions in Alyeska and Runyon against McCrary, which hold that under the American rule there has to be explicit authorization for the recovery of attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.271" offset="6359832">And in Runyon against McCrary in particular, there was an effort by the plaintiffs to rely on what they argued was an implicit authorization and a broadly granted... a broadly worded grant of remedial authority, and the Court said, no, it has to be an explicit authorization for recovery of attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.526" offset="6460874">Petitioner's claim here is... rests on a request that the Court build an inference upon an inference from the statutory language on which the petitioner relies, and that does not meet the standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="2493.231" offset="10111747">It certainly is unusual for attorneys' fees to be available in contribution actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.379" offset="10152289">This is not the common law rule, and as a matter of fact, the contribution provision itself says that it will be governed... that contribution will be governed by Federal law, and the Federal common law rule is the rule of Alyeska and of Runyon against McCrary, that in the absence of explicit authorization there should be no recovery of attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.229" offset="10271721">Now, I don't think that it is for the Court in this case to resolve whether it would be more desirable or less desirable for attorneys' fees recoveries to be available in contribution actions, and I don't think that Congress decided to bar the recovery of attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.844" offset="10370150">What I do think is that the line that we see between actions that are taken to remedy the pollution and assure that a polluter... rather than the public... who is jointly and severally liable will bear the cost... the line between that and reallocating costs among polluters is a very rational line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.922" offset="10478506">And it is rational in terms of considerations the Congress was aware of in the course of considering this legislation, and I want to just refer very briefly to a couple of indications of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.784" offset="10553948">Not because I say that Congress explicitly resolved it, because... but because I think it shows the wisdom of applying the Alyeska rule here, that Congress could have rationally not wanted to proceed that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.154" offset="10611417">And one is in the Senate committee report which accompanied the 1986 amendments, and the committee says that responsible sites often involve dozens or even hundreds of potentially responsible parties with differing types and degrees of involvement with the release.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.407" offset="10700443">While the Government may sue all potentially responsibilities, it need not sue all these parties; it may instead sue a limited number of parties to secure a complete cleanup or all costs of cleanup under the principle of joint and several liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.479" offset="10764704">Generally the Government seeks to obtain complete cleanup.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.681" offset="10777452">In some instances where the Government has sued major contributors of hazardous substances to a site but not lessor contributors, the parties named by the United States have, in turn, sued other potentially responsible parties in the same judicial action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.451" offset="10836593">In several cases this has resulted in massive and potentially unmanageable litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.225" offset="10863656">There is an amicus brief filed in our support in this case by a group called Sand Springs Superfund PRP Group, which claims to be put upon in this way, mostly because of claims for attorneys' fees that are being made against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.149" offset="10943381">I can't vouch for the accuracy of what they say, but it's an example of the kinds of complaints that have been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.688" offset="10993536">Then on... in supporting the conference report on the floor of the Senate, Senator Simpson, who was a member of the conference committee, pointed out to his colleagues:</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.725" offset="11049647">"There is not doubt that the immense transaction costs generated under Superfund, meaning lawyers' fees and the many technical and scientific studies required in litigation, have come to symbolize the worst excesses of the American legal system. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.856" offset="11118193">"Senator Domenici quoted Dickens' Bleak House in describing it last year, and he was right. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.921" offset="11138464">"We simply must work to have more societal resources spent on necessary and effective cleanup of Superfund sites and less on convoluted litigation which merely extends any public health threat that exists from these sites. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.908" offset="11190395">There are plausible reasons why Congress might have wanted to draw the line that we think emerges on the face of the statute, and reasons why there might have been concern that settlements that might be encouraged were attorneys' fees available in the contribution phase of the litigation, might sometimes be in terrorem settlements rather than something that would move the litigation along in a fair and just manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.064" offset="11355071">In any event, when the provisions on which petitioner relies are contrasted with the explicit provisions made for the award of attorneys' fees... and I realize that these create some difficulties for us as well, but not as much.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.968" offset="11430617">And we've set forth the citizens' suit provision on page 13 of our brief... Justice Souter was asking about it earlier... where section 310(f) of CERCLA provides that a court, quote, may award costs of litigation, including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees, to the prevailing or the substantially prevailing party whenever the court deems such an award appropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2860.051" offset="11578993">--It still is a rather striking difference in statutory drafting, and this provision was added at the same time in the 1986 amendments that the reference to enforcement activities was added, which certainly makes no explicitly reference to attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.974" offset="11654643">And then we refer later in the same paragraph to section 110(c) of CERCLA, which also is an explicit attorneys' fees provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.022" offset="11702813">So we think that there simply is not a sufficiently clear... there's too much ambiguity in resting on the double inferences that petitioner asks the Court to draw, to meet the standards of Alyeska and Runyon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.048" offset="11794973">And as we've explained in the concluding pages of our brief, the request for nonlitigation attorneys' fees really should be evaluated under the same standard; whether these were office costs devoted to securing a remedy and actually doing the cleanup or whether they were office costs devoted to reallocating the costs among consumers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2947.179" offset="11927466">The Government contrasts the citizens' suit provision, which uses the word "attorneys' fees", with the cost recovery provision, which uses the word "enforcement activities".</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.377" offset="11968322">The reason Congress chose the word 10125 is because it's broader than attorneys' fees, to encompass the costs of... incurred in enforcing the statute which are not incurred by attorneys; for example, private investigator costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.125" offset="12031225">The Government draws a distinction between the fees that might be awarded when a party is not liable versus the fees that might be awarded when a party is liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.422" offset="12068423">There's no basis for that distinction in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.863" offset="12078245">Nothing in the language or the structure of the statute supports that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.777" offset="12093919">And as a practical matter, that distinction does not make sense in the Superfund context, because Superfund imposes liability on virtually any party which is even remotely associated with the contamination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.634" offset="12141357">In fact, in many, if not most of the cases that EPA brings against... that the United States brings against one or two private parties, it's the United States Department of Defense which is, in many cases, the largest polluter at that particular site.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.671" offset="12193497">With respect to the issue of 10125 includes attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.251" offset="12239786">We agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.230" offset="12243652">The Government has contended that the language in section 10125 confirmed EPA's right to recover fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.866" offset="12274268">We agree, but Congress put that language of 10125, which was a section of general application, not one that applied only to the United States.</text>
