            <text syncTime="21.304" offset="250764">The issue presented in this case is whether the Nebraska supreme court failed to properly apply the constitutional principles set forth in Cage v. Louisiana to a jury instruction in Nebraska containing virtually identical language.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.314" offset="310846">The facts of this case specific to the issue of the reasonable doubt instruction are whether or not the defendant, Clarence Victor, the petitioner, was properly convicted of first degree murder, and whether or not it was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Victor killed purposely and with deliberate and premeditated malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.575" offset="379809">The responsibility for the death of the victim in this case is not at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.231" offset="398513">With respect to the specific instruction, I feel it is most simple to break it down into two basic parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.884" offset="425053">The instruction given in Mr. Victor's trial, NJI 14.08, is found at the Joint Appendix at page 11.</text>

            <text syncTime="73.909" offset="461207">Mr.... why... ordinarily we say instructions should be considered as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.334" offset="482941">Why do you feel you should break this down into two parts?</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark A. Weber</label>
            <text syncTime="82.045" offset="493703">--Well, I do believe the prior decisions of this Court do warrant looking at the instruction as a whole, but I think the plain meaning of the instruction, also consistent with the prior decisions of this Court, would be to see two basic parts, one being the burden for conviction, the other being the burden for acquittal, and in this particular instruction I see those two parts coming out in the plain meaning given to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.238" offset="574474">With respect to that instruction, I would draw a line after the sentence,</text>
            <text syncTime="109.481" offset="603522">"You may find the accused guilty upon the strong probabilities of the case provided such probabilities are strong enough to exclude any doubt of his guilt that is reasonable. "</text>
            <text syncTime="117.338" offset="634869">and I believe the following sentence to the end of that instruction is the burden in order to acquit, and as I've said, I believe the burden to convict in this case similar to in Cage is too low, and the burden to acquit too high.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.435" offset="679277">In this particular instance, with this instruction, a conviction is allowed on the strong probabilities of the case and to a moral certainty, as determined by prior decisions of this Court, of strong probabilities, and I believe the plain meaning of the instruction, that initial part with respect to conviction, the strong probability as read with the other portions of the conviction-related portion of the instruction, allow conviction on something that is tantamount to a civil preponderance of the evidence standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="218.426" offset="1039244">Well, as you found in... taking Winship in conjunction with Sullivan, just decided by the Court last year, the concept of reasonable doubt and the burden of the Government to prove reasonable doubt, to prove conviction beyond a reasonable doubt, is so fundamental that I believe it would be a recognized exception to basic rules of interpretation.</text>

            <text syncTime="242.268" offset="1134643">Well, again I refer only to Sullivan in the sense that it's such a fundamental guarantee with respect to due process, the fundamental right of trial by jury, and relieving the State of its burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.344" offset="1170901">I believe you recognized in Sandstrom and in Franklin that relief of the State's burden is a fundamental violation of due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="289.319" offset="1322829">--It is not, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.170" offset="1326278">Following the decision in Cage, the... specifically with my own experience the Douglas County District Court in Omaha, Nebraska, that county ceased using the instruction for the most part.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.719" offset="1368387">There were subsequent decisions by certain courts, specifically the supreme court of the State of Nebraska, distinguishing the objectionable instruction from that given in Cage, and I can note in all candor that some district judges then did recommence using the instructions, the instruction that is objectionable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.831" offset="1448844">I think it is fairly safe to say that because of the state of the uncertainty with respect to the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska holding the distinction by the Nebraska supreme court invalid that most, if not all of the courts in the State of Nebraska no longer use the defective instruction and rather use the instruction that is referred to as... it's contained within the appendix to counsel for Sandoval's brief at page B-23, NJI second criminal instruction 2.0, which was passed in 1992.</text>

            <text syncTime="359.296" offset="1602758">Yes, I think it would be safe to say it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.686" offset="1608296">However, there is some authority from the Eighth Circuit specifically with respect to using strong probabilities language up to approximately 20 years ago questioning that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.785" offset="1652704">I understand that the strong probabilities of the case language has been approved in and of itself in other decisions... I believe in Dunbar.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.558" offset="1679767">However, it is not my argument that this instruction is to be looked at under a microscope.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.053" offset="1705785">In looking at Poison Pills I understand that is not the test, but with respect to the instruction taken as a whole in allowing conviction in this case based upon the strong probabilities of the case, that is basically allowing a jury to convict on a possibility of guilt, which of course is not proof beyond a reasonable doubt, I think taking again the entire portion of the instruction that I believe relates to conviction in context, it reaffirms the jury's ability to find guilt on a civil... what is more akin to a civil preponderance standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.594" offset="1835979">And that specifically is the sentence that follows, "Excuse me", but precedes the strong probabilities language, and that, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="425.719" offset="1868475">"You may find an accused guilty. "</text>
            <text syncTime="427.592" offset="1875894">--excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.891" offset="1881118">"You may be convinced of the truth of a fact beyond a reasonable doubt and yet be fully aware that possibly you may be mistaken. "</text>
            <text syncTime="435.265" offset="1906614">In my mind, that reaffirms... in the plain meaning reaffirms a jury's ability to convict on a civil preponderance standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.319" offset="1930856">You take that hand-in-hand with the moral certainty language contained in Cage, it even allows the worst possible of scenarios that a jury can convict, in this case find first degree murder, in spite of or on evidence other than that presented at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.229" offset="1990519">The respondent adheres to the distinction drawn by the Nebraska supreme court.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.484" offset="2015492">It adheres to a rationale that I believe the Federal Court for the District of Nebraska indicated called for an exercise in mental gymnastics.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.688" offset="2056348">It belies logic that a juror reading this instruction would not be reasonably likely to misapply constitutional principles and allow conviction on something more akin to the civil preponderance standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.399" offset="2115176">With respect to the second portion of the instruction, acquittal is not permitted and perhaps this is the most heinous violation of the instruction, unless reasonable doubt is equivalent to a substantial doubt, and I submit that very first sentence of what I have carved out to be the second portion, or the acquittal portion of the instruction, defines is the only real and true definition of reasonable doubt.</text>

            <text syncTime="510.164" offset="2206186">Well, counsel, that would, if it stood alone, certainly come pretty close to Cage, but the balance of the sentence explains that the reasonable doubt has to be as distinguished from a doubt arising from a mere possibility, bare imagination, or fanciful conjecture, and viewed with that, perhaps it isn't a misstatement.</text>

            <text syncTime="555.312" offset="2386849">The substantial doubt, as you noted, is concededly violative of Cage.</text>

            <text syncTime="601.785" offset="2572736">I had anticipated your question to be that perhaps the fact that the substantial doubt language refers to the evidence that that somehow salvages this instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.139" offset="2610144">Indeed, that's what the Respondent would have you believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.653" offset="2620175">The simple response is that it's irrelevant whether or not the basis is the evidence or, as moral certainty would suggest, something other than the evidence and independent of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.358" offset="2658941">If the doubt is too high to acquit a particular defendant, it is still unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="2383.346" offset="9698941">Defendant's counsel will pick five or six words from a jury instruction and argue that those five or six words invalidates the entire instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.083" offset="9737915">This is like a doctor who operates on a patient and upon opening the patient up sees a perfectly healthy and normal appendix, reaches in, cuts the appendix in half, and has now found a defective appendix.</text>

            <text syncTime="2411.366" offset="9811058">Taken as a whole, there's nothing wrong with Nebraska's reasonable doubt jury instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.830" offset="9832896">This jury instruction was written by a distinguished committee of Nebraska lawyers, judges, and professors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.506" offset="9871558">Two of the members of the committee that wrote the Nebraska jury instruction in 1965 are now on the U.S. district court bench in the State of Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.940" offset="9901337">This is an extremely good faith effort by the State of Nebraska, under the direction of the Nebraska supreme court, to explain a concept that admittedly is hard to explain and yet is a very important one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.349" offset="9950970">I should point out that this instruction is more widely used in Nebraska than petitioner suggests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.034" offset="9977719">Indeed, that is illustrated by the reply brief of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.835" offset="9992870">The Nebraska supreme court, on December 17th, 1993, decided the Cook case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.650" offset="10012201">The Cook case was a crime committed in February of 1992 and tried sometime later that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.714" offset="10040413">The same instruction was used there that is before this Court today, and that case came out of Douglas County, our State's most populous county.</text>

            <text syncTime="2511.101" offset="10210000">There are substantial precedents supporting the committee's work in writing this jury instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.895" offset="10241138">Indeed, at the time Cage was decided, at least by our count there were 28 States that used one or more of the phrases that were questioned in Cage: 23 States used the term, moral certainty, in the jury instruction, and 16 other States, including Nebraska, used the term, substantial doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.999" offset="10309579">I think it's very clear that the widespread retroactive invalidation of all of these jury instructions would create enormous difficulties in the administration of justice over half of the States, or nearly half of the States of this United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.048" offset="10377706">States would be required to go back and retry several years, perhaps 5 years or 10 years, depending how far we take retroactivity, of criminal jury trials.</text>

Petitioner Victor in his reply brief argues that even under the Teague standard, because this is so fundamental, because the reasonable doubt jury instruction is so fundamental, it is part of the concept of ordered liberty, that if the instruction is invalid, that we would have to go back under a Teague test as well, and that, of course, is not the position of the State of Nebraska.</text>

            <text syncTime="2745.796" offset="11148736">Like many words in the English language, substantial has more than one meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.387" offset="11167127">Substantial certainly can mean a large amount of something, such as</text>

            <text syncTime="2757.921" offset="11197220">but substantial has other meanings as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.174" offset="11210281">For example, a Nebraskan might say,</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.016" offset="11217595">"My great-grandfather and grandmother homesteaded Nebraska and they built a small, one-room sod house, but it was a substantial structure able to withstand the strong winds of the prairies. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.425" offset="11267228">So substantial has more than one meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.117" offset="11277990">It can mean something solid, and in fact, to turn to our dictionary, Webster's Third International Dictionary defines substantial as</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.192" offset="11310278">"consisting of or constituting substance, not seeming or imaginative, not illusive. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.734" offset="11332534">and it is that meaning which is used in the Nebraska jury instruction, and if we look at the entire sentence in which the term, substantial doubt, is used in our instruction, it is clear that that is what is meant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2808.224" offset="11398467">"A reasonable doubt is an actual and substantial doubt reasonably arising from the evidence, from the facts or circumstances shown by the evidence, or from the lack of evidence on the part of the State, as distinguished from a doubt arising from mere possibility, from bare imagination, or from fanciful conjecture. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.898" offset="11473177">So substantial doesn't always mean a large quantity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.879" offset="11485089">It can mean, solid, something that is not simply imaginary, and that is the way it is used in the Nebraska jury instruction, and I think it is clear from the context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.565" offset="11527825">Strong probabilities language is also objected to, and I think a mere reading of the sentence in which that language appears answers the objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.711" offset="11564397">That sentence reads as follows:</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.355" offset="11574950">"You may find the accused guilty upon the strong probabilities of the case, provided such probabilities are strong enough to exclude any doubt of his guilt that is reasonable. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.820" offset="11612880">Substantially the same language was specifically upheld in this Court... by this Court in 1895 in the Dunbar case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.795" offset="11640779">Finally, we turn to the moral certainty language, and the California Attorney General I know will discuss this in greater detail so I will try and be reasonably brief on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.223" offset="11694487">First of all, I would note that unlike the moral certainty language in Cage, the Nebraska jury instruction specifically ties the moral certainty that the juror must feel to the evidence in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.254" offset="11750598">This sentence reads as follows:</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.215" offset="11758434">"It is such a doubt as will not permit you, after full, fair, and impartial consideration of all the evidence, to have an abiding conviction to a moral certainty of the guilt of the accused. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.433" offset="11807336">So Nebraska carefully ties the moral certainty, the fact that moral certainty must be felt as a result of the evidence presented in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.310" offset="11846833">Secondly, I would point out that this Court has long approved the moral certainty language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.672" offset="11872224">Going back to 1880, the Miles case, Perovich, Wilson, and another case cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.840" offset="11912870">The State of Nebraska and 23 other States have in good faith relied upon those holdings of this Court, and it certainly would be a great disservice to those States to now invalidate carefully written instructions based on this Court's own sentences, and certainly that should not be done for any light reason, and great deference should be given to the States in their decision to employ this language.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel E. Lungren</label>
            <text syncTime="3109.762" offset="12604593">Mr. Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.425" offset="12683274">California has an instruction on reasonable doubt which has in a sense stood the test of time in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.341" offset="12718905">It had its genesis in the Webster case from Massachusetts, first appearing, perhaps, in the California supreme court reports in 1860 when it commented favorably on that, continuing to impress it into statute form, and in 1927, the legislature, believing this instruction to be effective and to be accurate, further enacted legislation which said that if you give this instruction in a criminal case, no other instruction on reasonable doubt need be given, up to the present time, including the study that Justice Scalia mentioned a moment ago concerning CALJIC, our committee which reviews jury instructions and comes up with standardized jury instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.194" offset="12906359">While there is no empirical evidence before this Court as to how a particular juror understands this instruction, the best thing that I can direct you to is the review done by the CALJIC committee in 1987 pursuant to a request by the legislature to look at this instruction and to judge whether or not we should maintain that instruction, give no instruction whatsoever, or give another instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.904" offset="13013148">The committee was made up of both prosecutors and defense counsel and judges, including a Federal appellate justice, and the consensus at that time was that no change ought to be made, and of the minority report... a small minority, but in the minority report there was no consensus as what ought to be done in its place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.155" offset="13090157">And the reason I bring this up is that we all agree there can be no perfect way of defining reasonable doubt, I think, and yet when one would suggest that we need a definition other than that given in California for over 100 years, I would state that they have the burden of showing that their particular answer is better than what we have in the sense that it will not have some of the same challenges that admittedly any imperfect instruction would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.052" offset="13201752">Counsel for Sandoval stated it very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.194" offset="13214291">There is no one true definition of reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.996" offset="13225576">This Court has never found that there was one true definition of reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.859" offset="13241040">This Court has never stated that there is a constitutional requirement that it be defined, or has prescribed its description.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.296" offset="13270715">Rather, this Court, by not prescribing or requiring, has allowed the States to utilize their best judgment as long as they meet the standard of reasonable doubt, or unreasonable doubt... or reasonable doubt has been suggested constitutionally in the context of the Due Process Clause, and I would suggest that we might look at In Re Winship to see what, in fact, this Court believed what was so essential to the beyond a reasonable doubt instruction or concept that it was incorporated into our belief of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.721" offset="13424420">In Re Winship, in quoting Davis, a previous U.S. Supreme Court case, said that no man should be deprived of life under the forums of law unless the jurors are able upon their consciences to say that the evidence before them is sufficient to show beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of every fact necessary to constitute the crime charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.160" offset="13498189">The essential connection there is that the beyond a reasonable doubt standard protects the defendant and enforces or reinforces the obligation or burden on the State for proof, to carry the burden of proof of one's guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.493" offset="13563496">Further, referring to In Re Winship on page 364, the Court referred to two... I would say two definitions that I find virtually synonymous with moral certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.261" offset="13626607">That is, they talked about the subjective state of certitude, and they also spoke of the utmost certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.058" offset="13657745">I believe that if you interjected those words into, to a moral certainty, found in the California instruction, they would mean virtually the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.534" offset="13695675">At least there is no constitutionally significant difference between the expressions used by this Court in In Re Winship and the moral certainty used in the instruction in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.633" offset="13748129">I believe that the petitioner mistakes time-worn for time-honored.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.095" offset="13769967">In fact, this instruction has stood the test of time in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.028" offset="13785641">We admit it is not the perfect instruction, because there is no perfect instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.011" offset="13801628">It is important that we look at any instruction, obviously, as the standard requires us to do, in its total context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.816" offset="13832766">Boyde said that we could not judge any instruction in artificial isolation, and if you break down what to a moral certainty means in the context of this instruction, it in no way detracts from the obligation of the State to present its case and carry its burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.707" offset="13900371">In fact, I believe the most reasonable, the most likely reading of it, is to say that it enhances and reinforces the obligation of the fact-finder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.286" offset="13942689">It, in a very real sense, tells them that they are to go about their task of finding facts and then applying the law in a serious-minded fashion, much as In Re Winship suggested that jurors must be able to say, upon their consciences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.453" offset="13999323">That's not to say, religious beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.174" offset="14006219">That means, to be true to themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.446" offset="14019385">That means, to make a judgment that they can live with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.179" offset="14034222">It reinforces the concept of abiding, long-lasting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.794" offset="14060763">On the contrary, petitioner suggests that you take a definition of moral certainty which is contrary to the sense of certainty itself, and if you would accept or adopt petitioner's definitions, you would get to some strange sort of senses, that I have a lastingly and abiding sense that perhaps, maybe, something might be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.681" offset="14172253">That just falls on its face when you put it into context.</text>

            <text syncTime="3559.000" offset="14401504">It is to suggest, however, that there are many constitutionally valid definitions of reasonable doubt, and that's what we're about here, to determine what is constitutionally required, if there is one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.337" offset="14450927">In California, we have believed that it is more effective to frame it in the manner that we have, making sure that we don't run afoul of the problems articulated in Cage, chief of which I believe, at least concerning the phrase, reasonable doubt, was somehow it lacked what I would call an evidence connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.239" offset="14522503">The reference to moral certainty in our instruction is always in the background of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.366" offset="14558970">That is, it goes, reasonable doubt is that state of the case which, after the entire comparison and consideration of all the evidence, leaves the minds of the jurors in that condition that they cannot say they feel an abiding conviction to a moral certainty of the truth of the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.665" offset="14616230">Consistently throughout the instructions given in California, jurors are directed to evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.877" offset="14637024">There is no problem, as was suggested in Cage, that somehow they would believe that they should have something other than evidence, that somehow this meant that this was to be put in the place of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.676" offset="14692299">This modifies the abiding conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.217" offset="14702434">This talks about the manner of reaching, the manner about which... the seriousness about which you go about your business, but it does nothing to interfere with the quantum of proof obligated to the prosecution under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.028" offset="14765651">The California instruction does not have the other great impediment found by this Court in Cage, and that is to somehow create a equivalent or substitute definition, an unadorned, equivalent or substitute definition that is misleading, that being primarily, in Cage, grave uncertainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.359" offset="14891038">A grave uncertainty in Cage implicates to the juror that that manner, that amount of doubt necessary to acquit, is more than what is constitutionally permissible, or in many ways... you can look at it either from that standpoint or say, by virtue of so changing the amount of doubt necessary to acquit, you basically have shifted the burden of proof from the State to the defendant, and obviously that is... does not meet constitutional standard in any regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.203" offset="15030323">At the very least we can say that Cage thereby exaggerated or overstated the doubt necessary to acquit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.845" offset="15048923">There is no problem like that in the California instruction whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.708" offset="15064387">There is no... as our California supreme court said in viewing this in People v. Jennings, there is no transformation of true, reasonable doubt as it has been traditionally defined into a higher degree of doubt.</text>

            <text syncTime="4004.741" offset="16184518">I think the dictionary the jurors use are the instructions, and the question is, do these phrases that petitioner suggests are somehow inadequate, so inadequate that they rise to a constitutional challenge?</text>

            <text syncTime="4119.908" offset="16645213">One of the matters that I initially would like to take exception to is again the emphasis by the Nebraska Attorney General that somehow legions of individuals are going to be affected, in essence, the doors of the prisons left wide open in the State of Nebraska because of the throwing out of this invalid instruction, but I believe Justice Souter recognized that this fear, as I've said before, is a gross exaggeration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4147.166" offset="16754196">I don't believe there are very many, at all, individuals similarly situated to the petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4153.921" offset="16781259">As Mr. Stenberg I believe later recognized, I believe there are only a handful of individuals that objected to this instruction under direct review, as petitioner did in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4163.599" offset="16819920">May I ask on that point, is the reason that defense counsel may not have objected to the instruction the reason given by the California Attorney General that they think putting in, to a moral certainty, provides someone a good argument to the jury?</text>

            <text syncTime="4177.116" offset="16874046">That's a good question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4178.108" offset="16878016">I would take exception to the California Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="4180.747" offset="16888570">I believe that just the mere fact that that language happens to be lectured upon within the defense manuals from my perspective from the defense bar is more of a tacit admission that we're stuck with what we've got and we've got to make some sort of headway with that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="4196.039" offset="16949696">I don't believe you'll find many defense counsel certainly within Douglas County, Nebraska, where I practice, would concede that the moral certainty language is something that we like.</text>
            <text syncTime="4204.084" offset="16981879">Indeed, just submit the instruction I referred to recently... or, excuse me, the instruction used now, again contained in B-23 of Petitioner Sandoval's brief as an appendix, none of the defective language... moral certainty certainly is not contained within that instruction, and I would submit that, as Mr. Stenberg noted, the plaintiffs bar of the State of Nebraska as well as the defense bar were involved in the construction and creation of this instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4233.145" offset="17098176">If that language were so readily wanted and so defensible by the Attorney General, then I would wonder why there wasn't some sort of stipulation that the moral certainty language would be contained within that instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4244.562" offset="17143838">Secondly, with respect to the idea that other individuals had not raised this particular issue on direct appeal, and perhaps they would, I would submit that number 1, that's not the issue in this case, but number 2, it's directly addressed by the Nebraska supreme court in the case of the State v. Van Akron, in which, similar to Cage, the Court recognized the plain error analysis ability to review the instruction, and quite frankly, as the Court noted in that opinion, the raising of that issue at trial, much for the same reason it wasn't raised at trial in this case, was due to the futility of raising it in light of its prior decisions distinguishing the instruction given in Nebraska from the defective instruction in Cage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4289.222" offset="17322412">Finally, I find it very interesting that the Attorney General concedes at the beginning that we're not supposed to parse language and look at the individual terms, and yet he spends a great deal of his time arguing about... I see my time is up.</text>
