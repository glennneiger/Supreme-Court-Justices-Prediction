            <text syncTime="258.083" offset="1177837">There are approximately 70 million law abiding gun owners in this country who Congress has consistently sought to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.479" offset="1207407">The protection of hunters and sportsmen is codified in section 101 of the Gun Control Act, cited in our brief at page 39.</text>

            <text syncTime="287.374" offset="1295074">In the record, and throughout the case law, there are cited numerous instances where truly innocent possessors of semiautomatic rifles may be convicted of knowing possession of a machinegun.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.333" offset="1338855">For example, at trial of this case, Judge Cook expressly, repeatedly showed concern about people who may be out duck hunting and their sport rifle may double by accident, without any prior indication that it had such capability, and that doubling would result in conviction under the strict liability interpretation of 26 U.S.C. section 5861 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="323.228" offset="1438434">Under these circumstances, Judge Cook said, it violates our system of fair play, but he assumed that people wouldn't be prosecuted.</text>

Consider, for example, a situation in which a person who knows nothing about guns inherits a rifle from a relative.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.008" offset="1545536">Unbeknownst to the recipient, the gun is defective, occasionally discharges two rounds of ammunition, and after a single pull of the trigger, or perhaps it's been converted by a prior owner to an automatic weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.514" offset="1583571">Because he has no use for the rifle, the recipient stores it with other unnecessary possessions in the basement or attic, without ever having used it or examined it.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.531" offset="1619620">Under the strict liability theory, he would be prosecuted and sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.163" offset="1634144">The penalties which accompany conviction for violation of 6 U.S.C. 2561(d) are harsh: 10 years imprisonment, $10,000 fine, or both.</text>

            <text syncTime="968.586" offset="4019855">And interestingly enough, the testimony at trial from the expert, Mr. Fagg, in this case, was that this is not a weapon, for example, that you would want to sell to the military and represent was an M-16.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.803" offset="4064785">It's not a weapon, by the Government's expert's own concession, that would reliably fire multiple shots with a single pull of the trigger.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.588" offset="4095923">Interestingly enough, on page 16 of the Government's brief they make the following statement:</text>
            <text syncTime="996.374" offset="4131032">"In cases in which the offense involves regulation of an item that would not ordinarily be considered a hazard to the community, a rigorously knowledge element may be implied. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.042" offset="4169693">The rationale that all parties agree for the implication of a knowledge requirement is that any other result would risk criminalizing a broad range of innocent conduct, just as we were discussing earlier in the Liparota decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.998" offset="4213474">Certainly, I would not represent to this Court that guns are always safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.532" offset="4227685">But Congress has repeatedly and deliberately chosen only to register and tax those guns which are considered to be highly dangerous and offensive firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.646" offset="4272093">The Government says that Congress wants to prevent the conversion of semiautomatic weapons to automatic weapons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.824" offset="4300828">The petitioner does not disagree necessarily with that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.655" offset="4312113">However, that assumes some knowledge or purposeful act on the part of a person, just as in the Mittleider decision rendered by the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.979" offset="4341474">Defendant Mittleider sold his semiautomatic with a conversion kit to a undercover officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.426" offset="4379195">The conversion kit for this AR-15 is called an auto-sear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.077" offset="4389853">It's a very small part whose only function is to allow the gun to fire automatically more than one shot with a single pull of the trigger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.001" offset="4417543">Conversion of the gun cannot be accomplished reliably or purposefully without the auto-sear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.917" offset="4445233">Because the criminal offenses requiring no mens rea have a generally disfavored status, petitioner respectfully requests this Court to apply the rule of lenity in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.798" offset="4508762">Throughout their brief, the Government alludes to gangsters and criminals in connection with gun possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.681" offset="4588279">The petitioner is not a criminal, other than this conviction, and has no prior criminal record, nor does he advocate widespread use of machineguns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.949" offset="4621298">Petitioner does advocate fairness, however, in prosecution, and strongly believes that this honorable Court and the Congress and the Constitution promote justice and fair play by providing citizens with notice of what conduct is unlawful and to prove that the defendant had knowledge of his unlawful conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.448" offset="4687335">To allow 26 section 5861(d) to be a strict liability crime invites random prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.543" offset="4711682">The only support for this prosecution is an ambiguous statute that omits a critical element of fundamental and criminal jurisprudence, and that is the defendant's mens rea.</text>

            <text syncTime="1869.514" offset="7623603">The second point I'd make is that throughout the years since the Gun Control Act of 1968, when Congress has extensively... in 1968 they recodified the National Firearms Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.151" offset="7662160">In 1986 they amended it, as well as the Gun Control Act, which are the title 18 provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2613.895" offset="10601144">They are items that are very dangerous and are known to be dangerous by people, and Congress legislated under that background assumption.</text>

            <text syncTime="2633.150" offset="10678153">The short-barreled rifles or short... or sawed-off shotguns are also firearms under the National Firearms Act.</text>
