            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="149688">We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 92-1920, Karen Livadas v. Lloyd Aubry, California Labor Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.229" offset="198589">Mr. McCracken.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_g_mccracken" startTime="13.511" stopTime="152.590">
            <label>Mr. Richard G. McCracken</label>
            <text syncTime="13.511" offset="203709">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.242" offset="214576">This case is a challenge to the policy of the California Labor Commissioner not to enforce the California Labor Code on behalf of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements providing for arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.087" offset="257939">This case arose on January 2nd, 1990, when the petitioner, Karen Livadas, was terminated by her employer, Safeway Stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.314" offset="290854">California law requires that upon termination of an employee, the employer must pay all of the accrued wages due to the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.578" offset="319902">Ms. Livadas demanded, upon notice of her termination, that she be paid everything she was owed, but her store manager told her that she may not have it; that Safeway would instead mail it to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.106" offset="366086">Safeway did mail her a check, which she received on January 5th, in an amount which she never disputed was the amount due to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.722" offset="396493">However, she was not paid when she was due.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.864" offset="417077">California Labor Code section 203 provides penalties payable by an employer who so delays termination pay to an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.859" offset="449051">Ms. Livadas went to the local office of the California Labor Commissioner to file a claim for that penalty pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.455" offset="479458">She was entitled, under California law, to 3 days extra pay for the delay in her termination pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.358" offset="507043">She went to the Commissioner's office, tried to file a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.252" offset="522612">Eventually, she did file a claim on January 9th.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.983" offset="533584">Now, the purpose of the penalties provided by California law is to compel the employer to pay on time.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.459" offset="559497">In addition to that policy, the California Labor Code has also provided for many years that the Commissioner of Labor has the responsibility to ensure that the penalties are collected, that the law is enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.947" offset="617384">However, in this case the Commissioner, acting pursuant to his policy, decided not to pursue this claim, decided not to investigate it or to submit it either to prosection in court or to a hearing in the administrative procedures of the Labor Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.921" offset="685303">The reason for that decision was solely because she is covered by a collective bargaining agreement containing an arbitration clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.196" offset="718426">There was never a question that the amount that she was owed and was paid by Safeway was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.429" offset="743399">There was never a dispute in this case that in any way involved the collective bargaining agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="152.590" offset="760013">The Labor Commissioner, Mr. McCracken, never defended the policy on the basis that people who aren't covered by collective bargaining agreements really need more help from the State than people who are covered by collective bargaining agreements?</text>

            <text syncTime="183.022" offset="881744">--I don't believe so, because the... in this case the question is whether or not a decision can be based upon the exercise of Federal rights, in this case the right to select a collective bargaining representative and have a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.434" offset="951334">I don't believe that the State, however benign its intentions, may classify its services based upon that exercise, and that's what has happened here.</text>

            <text syncTime="217.776" offset="1020715">But even if it were, we don't believe that there would... that would be a sufficient defense to such a classification.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="223.289" offset="1042762">Mr. McCracken, you twice emphasized that there was no dispute about the amount due in this particular case, but the respondent does emphasize... and I'm looking at page 42 of the brief... that this is an example of a class of cases, and that in some such cases, at least, there would be a dispute about the amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.726" offset="1148506">For example, it mentions the possibility of a penalty sum and of vacation wages that might involve complex calculations based on the specific provisions of a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.256" offset="1202632">So suppose there were a dispute as to the amount and that dispute turned on what the wage provisions of the collective bargaining agreement meant?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_g_mccracken" startTime="273.863" stopTime="342.879">
            <label>Mr. Richard G. McCracken</label>
            <text syncTime="273.863" offset="1245055">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.225" offset="1250488">Justice Ginsburg, that situation, we believe, would be answered by the approach described by the Court in Lingle.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.796" offset="1268774">There are two separate systems of law here, and they can work together.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.781" offset="1288731">The Court described in Lingle what would happen in that situation, namely that the State claim would be still valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.896" offset="1321228">There would be resort to the collective bargaining agreement and arbitration process to find the answer to the question whether or not the employer had paid the employee everything that was due upon termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.102" offset="1362083">This case involves what I consider to be the more common class of cases, which is where there is total nonpayment of the termination pay on the date of termination, as opposed to a partial payment, but there's a dispute about whether it was the correct amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.632" offset="1416209">Now, under California law, it is only necessary, in order for there to be a willful failure to pay the termination pay, that the employer have intentionally not paid it.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.468" offset="1455497">And so upon return from the collective bargaining process of the answer whether or not the amount was correct, the Labor Commissioner would then have decided a question of State law, which is whether the intentional failure to pay everything that was due was a willful violation and therefore cause for penalties.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="342.879" offset="1521117">So what it boils down to is you're saying every time you look to Federal law for an answer to a question that arises in a State law action, you don't have preemption.</text>

            <text syncTime="355.997" offset="1573675">You would not have preemption even in the case where it's highly questionable what the meaning of the collective bargaining agreement is as to entitlement to vacation wages?</text>

            <text syncTime="366.384" offset="1615157">--In the case of termination pay we believe that is absolutely correct, that what would happen here is that the question of whether or not payment had been made on time would always be open for State law to resolve.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.732" offset="1664581">The question of whether or not full payment had been made is a question to be resolved in the grievance and arbitration process under the collective bargaining agreement, as the Court described in Lingle.</text>

            <text syncTime="711.611" offset="2996095">And I can see that arising in that type of case, where there is partial nonpayment as opposed to total nonpayment.</text>

            <text syncTime="727.620" offset="3060147">And certainly in that class of cases, it is not necessary to evaluate willfulness or anything of the sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.745" offset="3088568">We also believe that the way to handle that particular problem, Justice Kennedy, the one of the rare case in which there may actually be some question of contract interpretation that is at least tangentially involved, is nevertheless for the Labor Commissioner to go forward unless it is clear that the matter is preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.321" offset="3174877">So that the question of preemption, that is whether the claim is substantially dependent on analysis of the collective bargaining agreement, can be resolved by the California courts as... if the employer raises it as a defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1092.382" offset="4519138">And as far as whether or not there is some type of classification based upon section 7 rights that could be justified on a rational basis test, it's conceivable that there is, although the examples seem, to me, to be very limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.721" offset="4576503">One such example, conceivably, is a statute such as the one in Fort Halifax, where there was a specific provision made to allow the collective bargaining process to work so that the State law applied until a different result was obtained in collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.311" offset="4646929">And that, it seems to me, would pass a rational basis test, and a type of classification that could be... to which that test could be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.496" offset="4671588">The difficulty here, of course, is that the State has not given the process an opportunity to work, but rather has denied it materials with which to work, as informed--</text>

            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="1144.876" offset="4729162">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.221" offset="4762495">In this Court, respondent appears largely to have abandoned the argument that he was prevented from processing Ms. Livadas' claim by Federal preemption principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.427" offset="4799379">His argument, instead, is that his policy of nonprocessing is necessary to vindicate the State's independent policy of respecting arbitration agreements and holding parties to the terms of their contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.866" offset="4849117">And we think this reflects a fundamental misconception of the role of the labor arbitrator in a collective bargaining situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.019" offset="4873672">This Court has repeatedly made clear that a labor arbitrator operating under a collective bargaining agreement has power only to enforce the terms of the agreement, and the arbitrator does not have a general authority to enforce the terms of public laws that the parties have not incorporated into their contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.341" offset="4942948">Consequently, the result of the Labor Commissioner's policy is not that Ms. Livadas will be relegated to an arbitratal forum in order to pursue her claim for penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.727" offset="4980565">If Ms. Livadas somehow prevailed upon her union to take to arbitration her claim for section 203 penalties, the arbitrator would undoubtedly deny relief because the late payment provisions of California law have not been incorporated into the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.167" offset="5038348">Consequently, the result will be that Ms. Livadas lacks a remedy within the State system and lacks an arbitral remedy as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.881" offset="5065201">The consequence of that is that Ms. Livadas, and workers like her, will be deprived of State law protections that are available to all other employees within the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.647" offset="5100206">That seems to be precisely the result that this Court discountenanced in Metropolitan Life, when the Court said that a regime which would exclude unionized workers or workers covered by collective bargaining agreements from the reach of State minimum standards laws, would be incompatible with the policies animating the NLRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.897" offset="5173244">Second, I think that the kind of discrimination that is effected here, that is an exclusion from State law benefits for workers who are covered by collective bargaining agreements is precisely what was at issue in this Court's decision in Nash v. Florida Industrial Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.728" offset="5236565">The plaintiff in that case was an individual who had been denied unemployment compensation under Florida law because she had filed an unfair labor practice charge with the NLRB.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.457" offset="5279510">This Court held that that was a violation of her rights under the NLRA, and stated that the State of Florida should not be permitted to defeat or handicap a valid national objective by threatening to withdraw State benefits from persons simply because they cooperate with the Government's constitutional plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.786" offset="5344816">Here, also, Ms. Livadas is being denied State benefits otherwise available on the ground that she exercised her Federal right to participate in collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.012" offset="5385672">I think Nash makes clear both that individuals who exercise section 7 rights may not be penalized by the States for doing so, and makes clear, as well, that the penalty may take the form of a withdrawal of benefits that would otherwise be available under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.483" offset="5447530">And, finally, we believe that section 1983 is an appropriate vehicle by which Ms. Livadas can vindicate her Federal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.539" offset="5483788">This Court has made clear, in Golden State, that State action which interferes with the operation of the NLRA may form the basis for a section 1983 action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.718" offset="5528509">And, indeed, we think this is a much clearer case for 1983 relief than was Golden State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.701" offset="5548467">Here there's no need to infer from the structure of the act a Federal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.415" offset="5567275">Section 7 of the NLRA states explicitly that employees shall have the right to engage in collective bargaining and to join unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.621" offset="5600085">And to the extent that the State's action penalizes Ms. Livadas for exercising that right, section 1983 provides an appropriate remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1369.793" offset="5628819">Mr. Stewart, that's easy for you to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.436" offset="5643344">[Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.277" offset="5646792">But it must be admitted that our law on preemption is hard to figure out, at least as applied to the concrete facts of particular cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.517" offset="5711680">And what the Commissioner is arguing is, you know, cut me a little slack; at least where there's arguable preemption, I ought to be able to proceed in a reasonable fashion without being subjected to a 1983 action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.339" offset="5782942">Is it your contention that whenever he makes a mistake as to whether there's preemption or not, he's subject to being sued?</text>

            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="1414.733" offset="5808542">Well, if the mistake is simply that he reasonable believed that what he was doing is legal, that amounts to a claim of good-faith immunity which has no application to official capacity suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.860" offset="5845113">If he's making the claim that he reasonably and in good faith believed that what he was doing was required by Federal law, we think in this case there's no need to reach the issue of whether that could furnish a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.856" offset="5889104">Because this Court, in Lingle, cited as the example of when State authorities could interpret the collective bargaining agreement the situation in which it was necessary to look to the CBA in order to determine wage rates, and thus to calculate a penalty under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.767" offset="5944692">So even if there was a good faith defense of the sort that you postulate, it couldn't be applicable here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1454.788" offset="5968829">Well, this case is easy, but the Commissioner is going to have to decide what he's going to do in the future, if he loses this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.913" offset="5993280">Or is he going to be able to proceed in the fashion he did here at least where there is a dispute as to the amount of wages due?</text>

            <text syncTime="1467.347" offset="6018984">Well, clearly this Court may reach cases in the future in which a State official has operated on the basis of a preemption theory which was reasonable at the time, but turned out to be wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.465" offset="6059526">But there's certainly no basis for the respondent's argument that even though what he did may have been unreasonable, nevertheless he ought to be protected because a case may arise in the future in which the conduct was reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1512.147" offset="6198184">It is quite clear, in the context of official capacity suite, that a reasonable belief simply in the legality of one's actions is not a sufficient defense.</text>
