            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="145493">We'll hear argument next in Number 92-1168, Teresa Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc. Mr. Venick, we'll hear from you.</text>

          <turn speaker="irwin_venick" startTime="61.039" stopTime="159.285">
            <label>Mr. Irwin Venick</label>
            <text syncTime="61.039" offset="389581">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="64.322" offset="402747">This case calls upon this Court to determine whether psychological injury is a necessary requirement for a finding of hostile environment liability under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.797" offset="452589">The district court found that Teresa Harris was subjected to a continuing pattern of sex-based derogatory conduct that was not imposed upon men by the president of Forklift.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.503" offset="495429">The conduct was found to be unwelcome, offensive to Mrs. Harris, and would have offended a reasonable person in her position.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.693" offset="524164">Ms. Harris' claims were dismissed in the trial court and summarily affirmed on appeal based upon the Sixth Circuit rule requiring psychological injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.281" offset="558541">In Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, this Court stated that a hostile work environment exists if conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.256" offset="614443">This Court rejected the view that title VII was limited to tangible or economic discrimination, and further observed that title VII affords employees the right to work free from sex-based discriminatory insult and ridicule.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.932" offset="673166">The psychological injury test should be rejected because it conditions liability in a title VII case upon the reaction of the victim of discriminatory conduct in the workplace, rather than the effect of that conduct on the terms and conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.858" offset="732830">It therefore does not further the equal employment opportunity goals of title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.612" offset="751847">Because the district court's findings satisfy the Meritor standard, Ms. Harris requests reversal of the judgment below.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="159.285" offset="782567">Do you take the position that there should be no requirement of proof of subjective effect?</text>

            <text syncTime="166.289" offset="810571">Your Honor, it's our position that there is a subjective element in the unwelcomeness requirement.</text>

            <label>Mr. Irwin Venick</label>
            <text syncTime="171.659" offset="832095">But beyond that, in this particular case, Your Honor, there were findings that there was both subjective harm, and that Ms. Harris was also subjected to conduct that would have offended a reasonable person in her position, so that's not a question that this Court needs to reach in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.984" offset="885385">But with respect to clarifying the Meritor decision, it's our position that the Meritor test should be clarified to the extent that existing societal stereotypes should not be the standard against which hostile environment claims are evaluated.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.112" offset="945885">In my argument, I will first turn to the specific conduct that was found by the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.730" offset="964380">I will then discuss why the psychological injury test should not be required for a finding of a hostile work environment, and finally, I will argue that Forklift's test neither concedes the psychological injury requirement, nor comports with the test announced by this Court in Meritor.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.590" offset="1027805">The magistrate below found that Charles Hardy was a crude and vulgar man who demeans female employees in his workplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.179" offset="1058107">Through his conduct, Charles Hardy questioned the competence of Teresa Harris because she was a woman.</text>

            <text syncTime="580.757" offset="2468510">It is our view, though, that if the Court decides to address that question and wants to fashion a test, that what the Court needs to bear in mind is, what is the goal that we're trying to achieve, and I think that goal can be perceived in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.601" offset="2527860">First, it is essential that existing societal stereotypes be eliminated from consideration of workplace conduct, and secondly, we have to look towards the goals and objectives of title VII, which is to eliminate discrimination in the workplace, and I think if the Court is the address that point, I would suggest that it look at it from those two principles.</text>
