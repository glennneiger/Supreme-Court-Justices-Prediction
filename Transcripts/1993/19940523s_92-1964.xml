            <text syncTime="5.381" offset="112477">I have the opinion to announce for the Court in National Relations Board versus the Healthcare and Retirement Corporation of America, No. 92-1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.323" offset="148317">The National Labor Relations Act affords employees the right to organize and the right to engage in collective bargaining free from any employer and insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.791" offset="186143">The Act does not grant those rights to supervisory employees however, and that means that the statutory definition of supervisor becomes essential in determining which employees are covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.204" offset="231805">This case presents the narrow question whether the Board's rulings were consistent with the statutory definition when it adapted a test for determining if a nurse is a supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.232" offset="267958">The Act states that any individual who uses independent judgment in performing one of twelve supervisory functions in the interest of the employer is a supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.751" offset="305993">This case turns on the statutory phrase, in the interest of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.385" offset="320517">In cases involving nurses, the Board has stated that a nurse's direction of less skilled employees incidental to the treatment of the patients is not authority exercised in the interest of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.639" offset="365552">This case involves four nurses employed at the Heartland Nursing Home in Urbana, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.838" offset="382375">Heartland, which is the respondent here, had contended that the nurses were supervisors and so were not covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.316" offset="408288">The Board disagreed stating that the focus of the nurse's activity was on the well-being of the nursing home residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.553" offset="433261">The Court of Appeals held that Board's test inconsistent with the statutory phrase, in the interest of the employer, and ruled in favor of respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.802" offset="462205">We granted certiorari and we now affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.592" offset="473385">The Board has created a full septotomy between acts taken in connection with patient care and acts taken in the interest of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.283" offset="500135">Patient care is the business of the nursing home.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.689" offset="509748">It follows that attending to the needs of the nursing home patients, who are the employer's customers, is in the interest of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.599" offset="537437">That conclusion is supported by our 1980 decision in NLRB versus Yeshiva University and in our 1947 decision in Packard Motor Car Company versus NLRB.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.342" offset="580383">Because the Board's test is inconsistent with both the statutory language and this Court's precedents the Board put forth a series of non-statutory arguments but none is persuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.842" offset="614342">The Board argues, for example, that granting organizational rights to nurses, whose supervisory authority concerns patient care, does not threaten the conflicting loyalties that the supervisory exception were designed to avoid.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.030" offset="667109">The Act must be enforced according to its own terms, however, and by creating legal categories inconsistent with its meaning, as the Board has done here, is impermissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.755" offset="705979">We hold that the Board's test for determining if a nurse is a supervisor is inconsistent with the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.521" offset="733042">Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting opinion and she has joined therein by Justice Blackmun, Justice Stevens, and Justice Souter.</text>
