            <text syncTime="60.523" offset="397368">The principal question in this case is whether a State prisoner who wants to bring a section 1983 damages action in Federal court challenging assorted constitutional violations that took place during the course of a criminal investigation must first exhaust State postconviction remedies.</text>

            <text syncTime="124.247" offset="652323">First of all, part of the problem in this case, and one of the fundamental questions in this case, involves the court of appeals test, which is does a damages claim involve an attack on the validity of the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.493" offset="697254">And we think that that question is simply not meaningful in a case like this.</text>

            <text syncTime="168.369" offset="828807">It's possible that that occurred... that could have been a constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.165" offset="843958">It could be remediable on any number of theories, and yet it could have been harmless error at the trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="246.979" offset="1143217">It is true that that particular aspect of the prisoner's claim, and only that aspect of the prisoner's claim, in a sense turns on sort of a but-for question: Would the conviction have occurred but for the constitutional violation?</text>
            <text syncTime="258.333" offset="1188670">But even answering that question in the affirmative and saying that the prisoner would not have been convicted had the constitutional violation not occurred does not, in any sense, sort void the conviction or say that it is voidable now.</text>

            <text syncTime="310.421" offset="1397022">This is an old Federal tort statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.280" offset="1404441">I assume it incorporates normal tort principles such as causality.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.340" offset="1420637">It seems to me that one of the standard requirements, if you're bringing a cause of action which depends upon the unlawfulness of a conviction, is that the conviction have been set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.117" offset="1475808">You cannot bring a tort action for malicious prosecution, for example, unless you've been acquitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.006" offset="1495347">Why should you be able to bring this tort action for those constitutional violations that hinge upon innocence without first getting the conviction set aside or having been declared innocent?</text>
            <text syncTime="348.313" offset="1548532">I mean, other violations, for example unreasonable searches and seizures, I suppose you can sue on, no matter what, but your damages from being unlawfully detained, you're entitled to them only if you're unlawfully convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.025" offset="1615406">And why shouldn't we apply normal tort principles saying you're not... you're considered to be lawfully convicted unless and until that's set aside.</text>

            <text syncTime="1149.754" offset="4754384">And in such a case, damages are not an appropriate or available remedy in habeas.</text>

            <text syncTime="2184.007" offset="8891344">First of all, the State may well have very real and serious interests to protect in this type of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.223" offset="8916212">For example, the State may be, as Indiana here is, statutorily obligated to indemnify these officers, assuming they acted within the scope of their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.377" offset="8952784">In addition, in these types of litigation there may be legal questions at issue that may affect State policies that the State wants to preserve and protect against an adverse legal judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.433" offset="8993012">Those are very real consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.855" offset="8998759">And to put the State in this horrible box of saying you can either protect your interests or you can stay out is really, we believe, an unacceptable position here, particularly for what petitioner is asking for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.945" offset="9035122">In addition, we believe that that creates a tremendous hardship on the individual officers themselves, who often must rely upon the State for this type of representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.786" offset="9070439">Otherwise, they have to go out and hire outside counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2690.645" offset="10917923">If he says that in his complaint, then his complaint does not question the State proceeding, okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.096" offset="10935687">So he has to say it in his complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.158" offset="10939971">Well, I don't know that even that is correct under some of our precedents which say that the reason for suppressing... it is not a defense for the State in trying to get a confession admitted to show that, in fact, it's true, if it was, in fact, coerced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.776" offset="11014472">So that an acknowledgement that a statement he made was true but nonetheless coerced would still require its exclusion at trial, I think.</text>

            <text syncTime="2759.507" offset="11193359">I believe what is critical here is that if this... viewing the substance of the complaint rather than it's form, viewing the substance of this complaint, if this can be viewed as an attack on the convictions so that a determination, should it be favorable, would be the same determination that a later State court would make... that petitioner, in order to not short circuit the State judicial proceedings, ought to exhaust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.420" offset="11293042">But let's take really the most difficult case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.996" offset="11315298">I think the most difficult case is if the prisoner doesn't want to be released.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.320" offset="11336614">And I think there's good reason in these cases to not really believe these petitioners.</text>

            <text syncTime="2804.942" offset="11375066">But let's take really the hardest case, that we actually believe this petitioner that he no interest whatsoever in release, that there is still good reason to require to go ahead and exhaust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.234" offset="11420206">Because there are two consequences that would follow from a successful judgment in his favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.171" offset="11435984">Number one, he would, in fact, get damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.890" offset="11446851">And as was averted to in the other... earlier questioning, any rational State, when a petitioner receives a 20-year sentence and in year one gets damages to pay him for those next 20 years, would feel coerced to release that prisoner, even if he doesn't want to be released.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.898" offset="11510903">States are not in the business of paying prisoners to be in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.646" offset="11525950">But second, not only the... and this Court recognized that in Fair Assessment v. McNary... the inherently coercive effects of a damages judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.985" offset="11571298">So as a purely practical matter, putting aside res judicata, formal issue preclusion, as a purely practical matter, that damages judgment should prevent... would cause a State to release him.</text>

            <text syncTime="2953.961" offset="11971181">But we believe that the most rational system here is one that takes into account those other cases outside of pure 2254(b) principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.316" offset="12008588">This Court need not decide that issue, but we believe that that is really the most rational, orderly system for handling attacks on convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.797" offset="12042547">Let me address for a moment issue two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.030" offset="12055399">Their argument is this case has to be dismissed merely because there is jurisdiction, and in addition because of the statute of limitations bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.792" offset="12090508">Let me address the jurisdictional point for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.041" offset="12099494">The fact that there is jurisdiction alone does not require a stay, as this Court's habeas cases demonstrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.508" offset="12129378">There may be... a 12(b)(1) lack of jurisdiction dismissal may not be appropriate, but a 12(b)(6) dismissal is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.770" offset="12166368">We believe that exhaustion is a requirement for these types of claims, and therefore even though there is jurisdiction, he has not satisfied a prerequisite and dismissal is appropriate under 12(b)(6) and that ought to be enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.325" offset="12232614">Furthermore, the cost of these cases being on the docket is really very real.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.995" offset="12251318">The fact is that the vast majority of these cases will not be meritorious, and there's a real cost to getting rid of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.289" offset="12276500">A Federal court has to look for these nonmeritorious cases, has to review the file, has to send an order, has to receive that order back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.677" offset="12310041">All of that takes time, and that is not cost free.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.426" offset="12324983">In addition, there's a cost to our office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.238" offset="12332297">We also have to respond to these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.673" offset="12338044">In addition, there is a cost to the defendants themselves who, in this case, are defendants in a 3 million dollar lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.858" offset="12362704">That affects their credit rating and that could prevent them from buying a house.</text>

            <text syncTime="3136.169" offset="12699997">First of all, I think that the central question in this case is one that has been identified by Justices Scalia and Stevens in some of their questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.102" offset="12731762">The fact is that petitioner in this case, and petitioners in cases like this, are not necessarily attacking the validity of their conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.663" offset="12754018">Respondents have focused entirely on the element of petitioner's claim which asks for damages for the period of his confinement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3165.672" offset="12817966">And respondents don't really offer this Court any test at all for resolving these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.748" offset="12830296">In fact, whenever a petitioner... whenever a prisoner advances a claim that there was a Fourth Amendment violation, or any sort of violation as to which harmless error might apply, there is no way of determining, on the face of that complaint, whether or not that calls into question the validity of the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.665" offset="12889959">I mean Judge Coffin wrote, I think, a very thoughtful opinion for the First Circuit on precisely this point in a case called Guerro v. Mulhearn, which is discussed in the briefs, in which he noted that it's impossible to determine, without going through the entire line of analysis, if the search was unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="3205.297" offset="12976477">--Well, I think there's no justification for that, Chief Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.654" offset="12989956">As a general matter, of course, the Court has held repeatedly that Congress intended that 1983 claims not be exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.653" offset="13009914">Now, there's a specific reason for the exception recognized for that in Preiser.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.104" offset="13027781">The specific exemption is that the Court found that it was the intent of Congress that section 2254(b), the Federal habeas exhaustion requirement, applied when the petitioner actually filed what was a habeas petition, an action seeking an injunction that would lead to his release.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.802" offset="13082534">The Court said that is a habeas petition and you must exhaust under section 2254.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.846" offset="13098730">But the Court went on to say... and I think it's clear from the face of the habeas statute, that a petitioner who is asking for something other than release is not filing a habeas claim, and as respondents... I think as my colleague from Indiana conceded, they are not saying that the section 2254(b) exception applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.746" offset="13154319">They are applying or asking the Court to create a much more far-reaching comity exception to the general 1983 rule that does not provide for exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.196" offset="13192144">The Court has never done that in a situation such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.431" offset="13201026">The Court has never said that although you can bring a section 1983 action at some point, you'll have to hold off doing it now because there are some general State interests... which I think, really, have not been clearly articulated for the Court as to precisely what they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.410" offset="13252957">The reason that the Court and Congress have required exhaustion in the habeas setting is that for a Federal court to issue a writ of habeas corpus is an extraordinarily intrusive thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.874" offset="13286812">It sets aside a State judgment, it requires a State official to take action in an area of considerable concern to the State, and it short circuits the use of State judicial proceedings, post-conviction proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.089" offset="13323697">None of that is true of a damages action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.244" offset="13332265">It has no effect on--</text>

            <text syncTime="3295.509" offset="13337385">It's also an equitable proceeding so that we have... I mean it's a prerogative writ, so we have much more discretion, traditionally, in refusing to grant the petition.</text>

            <text syncTime="3303.288" offset="13368418">--That is also true, Justice Scalia, which is a reason why habeas should be differentiated from section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.879" offset="13390883">The damages action has none of those consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.035" offset="13399452">Not only does it not call into question the validity of the conviction; it does not require the State to do anything other than to pay the damages judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.549" offset="13425470">It does not short circuit the use, as respondent suggest, of State postconviction procedures, because the prisoner is still going to have to go into State court if he wants release.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.794" offset="13454518">Those are the concerns that have motivated the Court in all the line of habeas cases emphasizing the importance of exhaustion; none of them are present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.479" offset="13485238">And that is particularly important when, as I emphasized, it is the case that for many of these claims it's not going to be apparent, on the face of the complaint, whether or not the validity of the conviction is in any manner called into question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.397" offset="13524944">And I think given the force of the 1983 no exhaustion rule repeatedly applied by the Court, that should be dispositive here.</text>
