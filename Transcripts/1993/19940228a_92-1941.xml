            <label>Mr. Kent L. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="50.263" offset="349528">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="56.618" offset="374919">This case concerns whether Congress may promptly and retroactively correct a palpable drafting defect in tax legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.122" offset="408879">Respondent is the executor of Willametta Day, who died in September 1985.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.116" offset="432911">One year after her death, Congress enacted the 900-page-long Tax Reform Act of 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.162" offset="461123">One provision of that complex act, codified at section 2057 of the Internal Revenue Code, established a new estate tax deduction in the amount of one-half of an estate's sale of stock to the corporate issuer's employee stock ownership plan, or ESOP.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.965" offset="536252">Respondent sought to take advantage of this new deduction by purchasing $11 million of the stock of MCI Corporation in December 1986, which was 15 months after Mrs. Day died.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.173" offset="585153">He sold the stock two days later to the MCI ESOP at a somewhat lower price.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.536" offset="606573">He claimed an $11 million estate tax deduction under section 2057... I'm sorry, he claimed a five-and-a-half-million dollar estate tax deduction under section 2057 for half of the value of the proceeds of the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.366" offset="665923">The claimed deduction resulted in a two-and-a-half-million dollar estate tax savings.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.299" offset="685672">Now, applied as Respondent did in this case, section 2057 would permit the executor of any estate to entirely eliminate its estate tax obligation simply by purchasing and reselling corporate securities after the decedent's death.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.100" offset="748888">As contemporary financial commentators noted, this application of the statute would, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="157.233" offset="777414">"be the tax loophole you could drive a truck through. "</text>
            <text syncTime="159.734" offset="787341">Congress obviously did not intend in 1986 to eliminate the Federal estate tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.060" offset="812627">But recognizing that section 2057, interpreted in this manner, could have that effect, the Internal Revenue Service promptly proposed an amendment to the statute--</text>

            <text syncTime="180.789" offset="871559">I mean, you said that Congress made a mistake, but didn't the words mean what they appear to mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="187.624" offset="898936">There was no requirement that the decedent own the stock at the time Congress enacted this measure?</text>

            <text syncTime="208.728" offset="983363">So, yes, we do concede that the statute should have been more explicit.</text>

            <text syncTime="260.591" offset="1190776">Our position is that, as Professors Bitker and Eustis said, a lawyer's passion for technical analysis of the statutory language should always be diluted by distrust of a result that appears too good to be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.740" offset="1251380">We think that this executor, in seeking this tax windfall, should have known and probably did believe that his hoped-for windfall should be diluted by distrust of this result.</text>

            <text syncTime="305.360" offset="1369871">On the other hand, it was such a glaring deficiency, it was such... it was a newsworthy goof in the 1986 Act, and it was reasonable to assume that Congress would promptly amend the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="347.259" offset="1537473">The court... the 9th Circuit held that this briefly retroactive amendment violated the due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.962" offset="1568297">Under the due process clause, legislation must not be arbitrary or capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.967" offset="1588255">It must reflect a genuine exercise of a valid legislative power.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.339" offset="1605809">In the Pension Benefit and the General Motors cases, this Court held specifically that retroactive legislation satisfies these due process requirements if there is a... if the retroactive features of the statute are a rational means of accomplishing a legitimate Government interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="389.135" offset="1704970">What if... what if the Congress came along and said our theory of taxation, based on the assumptions of supply-side economics in the eighties, turned out to be wrong; we lost too much money.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.742" offset="1747393">So, we want to go back... let's assume they do it consistently with the statute of limitations at least... we want to go back and refigure the tax rates for those years to recover money.</text>

            <text syncTime="419.945" offset="1828268">What the Court said in Welch v. Henry was, assuming a tax could go so far back to make that objection valid.</text>

            <text syncTime="1599.354" offset="6545878">The fundamental issue is the one that the Court has been questioning, and that is, whether there is a due process constraint on the retroactive application of the taxing power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.502" offset="6586420">I will suggest that there is a limit; that the case before you is one with very unusual facts, which clearly demonstrate that the limit can be exceeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.356" offset="6625812">The critical element here is the element of specific inducement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.191" offset="6645248">I will close by addressing the Government's siren song that it was simply too good to be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.267" offset="6677535">As Justice O'Connor reminded us two years ago in the Romein decision, retroactive legislation presents more serious problems of unfairness than prospective legislation, because it can deprive citizens of legitimate expectations and upset settled transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.137" offset="6745035">And while we don't argue about Congress' broad latitude to enact retroactive legislation as a general proposition, it is constrained by due process from enacting arbitrary and irrational legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.316" offset="6797698">Put another way, retroactive legislation must be supported by a legitimate legislative purpose furthered by a rational means.</text>

            <text syncTime="1807.401" offset="7378034">Now, we have another provision in the Constitution that prevents ex post facto laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="1815.987" offset="7412412">Wouldn't you think that if there was a guarantee against retroactivity generally it would have been... would have been put in that provision rather than in... it seems to me, you know, inclusio unius est exclusio alterius, since we only prohibit criminal and penal ex post facto, the implication is that retroactive laws or whatever else they may be, are not unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.832" offset="7511781">And there were... there were State... State constitutional provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.055" offset="7528709">We had one in a case before us a few weeks ago, that did pro... prohibit retrospective legislation generally, but we chose not to do that in the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1859.826" offset="7587746">On the other hand, we have very clear precedent from this Court for the last 200 years that, in some instances, retroactive legislation does violate due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.581" offset="7630795">And there's nothing special about tax legislation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1877.036" offset="7656604">But whether you... you look at the language from Turner Elkhorn or Gray on the one hand, or Hemme and Welch on the other, we recognize that sometimes the Congress goes too far in changing the tax law retroactively.</text>

            <text syncTime="1902.772" offset="7759527">I mean, if we concluded, for example, that in fact there was no legitimate purpose to be served, or there was no rational relationship between the act and the legitimate purpose the Government claimed, wouldn't we, in effect, embody that conclusion by saying, yes, it was unduly harsh and so on?</text>
