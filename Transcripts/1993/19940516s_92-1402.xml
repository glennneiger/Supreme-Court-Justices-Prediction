            <text syncTime="2.285" offset="100814">I have the opinion for the Court in C &amp; A Carbone, Inc. versus the Town of Clarkstown, No.92-1402.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.046" offset="131847">As solid waste output continues apace and landfill capacity becomes more costly and scares.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.811" offset="158910">State and local governments are expanding significant resources to develop trash control systems that are efficient, lawful, and protective of the environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.692" offset="194436">The difficulty of their task is evident from the number of cases this Court has served involving waste transfer and treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.545" offset="225888">This case considers a measure commonly called a flow control ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.817" offset="246890">The Town of Clarkstown, which is located in Southern New York near the New Jersey boarder, enacted the flow control ordinance to ensure that the transfer station that it caused to be built would be a profitable enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.070" offset="299971">The ordinance requires all solid wastes to be processed at one designated transfer station before leaving the municipality.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.981" offset="327556">The transfer station charged a fee for disposal of unsorted solid waste in excess of the fee charge in the private market.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.776" offset="354724">In other words, all of the waste had to go to one transfer station and that transfer station charged more than the market rate for processing.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.069" offset="379906">As part of this arrangement, the contractor who built the transfer station agreed to operate it for five years and then sell it to the town for $1.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.528" offset="409790">The flow control ordinance, thus, serve to amortize the cost for Clarkstown to construct its own waste transfer facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.817" offset="434972">The town filed suit in New York State Court against C &amp; A Carbone, the petitioner in this case, a solemn injunction requiring Carbone to use the designated transfer station rather than Carbone's own facility in Clarkstown.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.806" offset="478858">The court granted the injunction and the Appellate Division affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.239" offset="488575">We granted certiorari to consider whether the flow control ordinance violates the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.754" offset="506652">It is well-established that the Commerce Clause prohibits local laws that impose commercial barriers that discriminate against an article of commerce by reason of its origin or destination out of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.120" offset="548134">Clarkstown protest that its ordinance does not discriminate because it does not differentiate solid waste on the basis of its geographic origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.355" offset="577078">All solid waste, regardless of its origin, must be processed at the designated transfer station before it leaves the town.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.919" offset="603305">But this argument misconceives the relevant article of commerce in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.801" offset="618874">As the town itself points out, what makes garbage a profitable enterprise is not its own worth but the fact that its possessor must pay to get rid of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.443" offset="649490">In other words, the article of commerce is not so much the solid waste itself but rather the service of processing and disposing of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.174" offset="680419">With respect to this stream of commerce, the flow control ordinance discriminates.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.684" offset="698391">It allows only the favorite operator to process waste that is within the town limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.991" offset="715632">It is just one more instance of local processing requirements that we have long held invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.665" offset="734335">The essential vice in laws of this sort is that they bar the import of the processing service, they horde a local resource for the benefit of local businesses that treat it.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.110" offset="768085">The flow control ordinance has the same design and effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.448" offset="781460">This sort of discrimination is per se invalid, save in the narrow class of cases in which the municipality can demonstrate under rigorous scrutiny that it has no other means to advance a legitimate local interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.319" offset="824928">But here, Clarkstown has a number of non-discriminatorial alternatives for addressing the health and environmental problems alleged to justify the ordinance in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.744" offset="862649">State and local governments may not use their regulatory power to favor local enterprise by prohibiting patronage of out of state competitors or their facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.259" offset="896712">Because the Town of Clarkstown has attempted to do so through the flow control ordinance in this case, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Division and remand the case for proceedings not inconsistent with this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.605" offset="938090">Justice O'Connor has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment; Justice Souter has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Justice Blackmun join.</text>
