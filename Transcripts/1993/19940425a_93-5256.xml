            <text syncTime="46.592" offset="329133">This case calls upon this Court to make clear what it has indicated in every case on this issue in the past 30 years, and that is that a postarrest statement of an uncross-examined alleged accomplice, made in the throngs of custodial interrogation, which implicates a defendant, is inadmissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.771" offset="409904">This Court has repeatedly recognized the inherent and unique untrustworthiness of these statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.205" offset="435608">They are made in the coercive atmosphere of police interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.204" offset="455566">They are made under circumstances when the declarant has every motive to speak without regard to the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.154" offset="487435">These are desperate people in desperate times.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.762" offset="501855">People that are arrested, their lives pass before their eyes, and they were motivated to speak in order to curry favor, in order to assist their own situation, and for the same reason that is why they attempt to shift blame to someone else, to put the light on a different person, and to divert the attention from themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.862" offset="590253">The Government in this case recognized the inadmissibility of these statements, of Harris' statements, when it took the extraordinary measure of moving to sever Harris, the declarant in this case, from Williamson, the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="138.366" offset="696206">Harris' statements in this case graphically demonstrate the validity of this presumption that this Court has repeatedly recognized, and why today this Court should make these statements categorically inadmissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.815" offset="750018">He was explained... in custody he was told that he would be advised what benefit he would receive for making statements, cooperative statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.763" offset="789829">He knew that the thing he needed to do was to finger someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.167" offset="811458">That's what he could do to relieve the burden that was placed on him at this moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.884" offset="826296">That's something that everyone his shoes knows they need to do in order to get out from under the criminal justice system at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.131" offset="855344">They don't need to be promised.</text>

            <text syncTime="182.505" offset="872794">The mere suggestion in this case that some benefit might inure if he cooperated was enough to effect his state of mind so that he would speak, regardless of the truth of what he said.</text>

            <text syncTime="211.367" offset="988255">He was found in position, and he knew what it was, and he was transporting it, so that would be enough to convict the declarant of several offenses, I--</text>

            <label>Mr. Benjamin S. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="256.523" offset="1168918">The broad exclusionary principle would be that these types of statements... in other words, statements of uncross-examined, alleged accomplices such as Harris, which are made in the throngs of custodial interrogation which implicate in a self-serving way a defendant such as Williamson, should categorically be excluded.</text>

            <text syncTime="283.231" offset="1275706">All of this is technically hearsay, I take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.167" offset="1287409">These are people who don't testify at trial, and you're trying to get it in as an exception to the hearsay rule, and traditionally the declaration against penal interest is contended by the Government, I think with some reason, that it's a well-established exception to the hearsay, rooted in history.</text>

            <text syncTime="1461.899" offset="5990390">Petitioner argues that an inculpatory confession made by an accomplice to the police while he's in custody should be excluded per se under the rules of evidence and under the Confrontation Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.284" offset="6047964">That contention, however, finds no support either in the rules or in this Court's Confrontation Clause cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.375" offset="6072310">As to the rules, petitioner's argument would mean that no matter how overwhelmingly all of the other circumstances of the case pointed to the admissibility of a statement under the rule, the district court would be required to exclude any such statement as long as it was made by an accomplice to the police while the declarant was in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.803" offset="6157992">So if you think about this situation, if someone went to the police and was in custody and said, I murdered Fred, took the watch off of his wrist, and sold it to Joe, that statement would have to be excluded in Joe's trial for possession of stolen goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.672" offset="6225492">In other words under petitioner's view, no district court could find that a reasonable person in the declarant's position would not have made the statement admitting to a capital crime, and at the same time implicating someone else in a misdemeanor.</text>

            <text syncTime="2354.700" offset="9561538">Now, one other point I would like to make is that the chief justice had mentioned earlier the possibility that the jury would be able to weigh the various circumstances that surround the making of the statement, and I would like to reinforce that point by noting that under Rule 806 of the Federal Rules of Evidence a declarant can be impeached as to a hearsay... the credibility of a declarant can be impeached with respect to a hearsay statement to the same extent as a person making the same statement in court in live testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="2781.872" offset="11270260">The penal interest rule that you're advocating rests on the assumption that most of the time these statements are made even though it is not to the defendant's net benefit, as he understands it, to make them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2796.101" offset="11327207">And that's the very premise of the longstanding exception for declarations against interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.176" offset="11347478">Almost as early as the hearsay rule itself developed, the courts developed an exception for statements against interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.315" offset="11376004">Statements against pecuniary interest and proprietary interest were the first ones to develop, and the supposition is that people don't say things against their own interest if they are lying, and that gives--</text>

            <text syncTime="2822.261" offset="11431801">--The calculus may very well change when there are multiple defendants, but the district court is perfectly situated to evaluate all of the factors and circumstances in determining whether the calculus has changed in a way such that a reasonable person in the declarant's position would fabricate his story in order to gain advantage from the authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.458" offset="11504630">I mean, our basic... in all sorts of contexts, we trust the district court to assess the probativeness of evidence, and this Court has been very reluctant to shackle district courts in the context of admitting hearsay with per se rules that restrict their ability to consider the whole picture in deciding whether something fits within a hearsay exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.574" offset="11589058">In Bourjaily, the Court rejected a per se rule forbidding district courts from considering hearsay evidence in determining the admissibility of statements pursuant to the coconspirator exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.835" offset="11630123">In Idaho v. Wright, the Court rejected a per se rule that would prevent district courts from allowing the introduction of hearsay that was made by a witness who was unavailable because she was determined to be incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.253" offset="11675785">One of the purposes of the Confrontation Clause and the principal purpose, we would submit, is to further the truth-seeking function of the trial, and if petitioner's view is accepted, a district court looking at an array of circumstances, if confronted with the fact of custody, will have to ignore every other fact, put on blinders, and say, this statement doesn't come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.134" offset="11763347">We think that's contrary to the general approach of this Court and the lower courts, the Federal Rules of Evidence, and it's contrary to the plain language of Rule 804(b)(3).</text>
