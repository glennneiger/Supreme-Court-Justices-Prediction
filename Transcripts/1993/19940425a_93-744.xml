            <text syncTime="10.325" offset="194597">Mr. DuMont.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward C. DuMont</label>
            <text syncTime="11.481" offset="199195">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.088" offset="213615">In adjudications under the Black Lung Benefits Act and the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, the Department of Labor and the courts have long applied an evidentiary tie breaker known as the "true doubt" rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.020" offset="261366">There are three points fundamental to understanding the proper outcome of this case: what the "true doubt" rule is, where it comes from, and why its application does not contravene the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.875" offset="312775">First, it's important to understand what the "true doubt" rule does and does not say.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.404" offset="334927">It's applied in the adjudication of contested benefit claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.106" offset="349660">It resolves factual issues in favor of a claimant if, but only if, two prior conditions are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.307" offset="374529">First, each party, both the claimant and the employer, must have adduced substantial, competent evidence to support the position that that party is taking in the adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.413" offset="418937">And second, the trier of fact must have evaluated the evidence and concluded that the evidence produced on each side is equally probative.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.173" offset="461987">In those rare circumstances of evidentiary equipoise, the "true doubt" rule intervenes to direct that judgment be rendered for the claimant.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="84.998" stopTime="90.762">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="84.998" offset="493229">How rare is rare, Mr. DuMont?</text>
            <text syncTime="86.701" offset="500126">One of the amicus briefs says it seems to happen all the time.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edward_c_dumont" startTime="90.762" stopTime="108.692">
            <label>Mr. Edward C. DuMont</label>
            <text syncTime="90.762" offset="516322">Well, I think that we can see that it doesn't happen all the time from the fact that, as the statistics quoted in our brief point out, under current law, black lung claimants are successful in achieving benefits only in about 7 percent of the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.053" offset="569507">Now, if the 50 and 100 percent.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="108.692" stopTime="112.941">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="108.692" offset="588002">What percentage of those 7 percent are "true doubt" cases, do you know?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edward_c_dumont" startTime="112.941" stopTime="136.556">
            <label>Mr. Edward C. DuMont</label>
            <text syncTime="112.941" offset="605033">Those are the cases... well, we don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.642" offset="611825">Presumably, less than all of them, so that in even a smaller percentage is the "true doubt" rule determinative of the outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.609" offset="639724">Now, it may be that in many cases the rule is recited, or it may be in some cases that the rule determines one issue but it does not determine the outcome, because there are various cases where a claimant prevails on one issue because of the "true doubt" rule but another issue goes in favor of the employer.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="136.556" stopTime="149.942">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="136.556" offset="699492">Was... go ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.087" offset="705657">Well, I'm just pursuing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.899" offset="712867">One ALJ seems to have found "true doubt" in four cases in one year, complete equipoise of the evidence, which one would think would be extraordinary.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edward_c_dumont" startTime="149.942" stopTime="172.307">
            <label>Mr. Edward C. DuMont</label>
            <text syncTime="149.942" offset="752991">Well, we think that in some of these cases there are reasons why the ALJ... particular reasons why the ALJ's may find equipoise more commonly than normal, particularly because you often have cases such as the early cases under the Longshore Act or the Maher case here, where there's a complicated question of medical causation, you have respectable medical opinions on both sides of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.105" offset="837732">In some cases the ALJ--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="172.307" offset="842539">Do you have figures for the rarity under the Longshore Workers' Act comparable to the Black Lung Benefits?</text>
            <text syncTime="179.320" offset="870542">Is it the same?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edward_c_dumont" startTime="179.930" stopTime="191.910">
            <label>Mr. Edward C. DuMont</label>
            <text syncTime="179.930" offset="872945">--There are no comparable compiled or published statistics.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.351" offset="886633">The Department of Labor informs us that the 7 or 8 percent of Longshore cases, so the figure would be comparable to that extent.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="191.910" stopTime="198.533">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="191.910" offset="920906">Well, and that is your definition of very rare, 7 or 8 percent of the cases.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edward_c_dumont" startTime="198.533" stopTime="235.782">
            <label>Mr. Edward C. DuMont</label>
            <text syncTime="198.533" offset="947446">Well, we would simply point out that it's not being applied across the board and indiscriminately by ALJ's to avoid their responsibility to evaluate the evidence and to reach conclusions as to which party has produced preponderance, where one party or the other has produced a preponderance.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.931" offset="1012962">We think that the evidence is generally to the effect that the ALJ's take their responsibility very seriously, and that the Benefits Review Board and the courts of appeals, in turn, take their responsibility seriously to review those judgments and to make sure that in cases where this rule is applied, one can fairly say that the fact finder was not able to determine that one side had produced a preponderance.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="235.782" stopTime="244.434">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="235.782" offset="1096449">Mr. DuMont, what is the standard of review of the ALJ on whether or not it was correct to say the evidence was in equipoise?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edward_c_dumont" startTime="244.434" stopTime="263.130">
            <label>Mr. Edward C. DuMont</label>
            <text syncTime="244.434" offset="1131035">Both the Benefits Review Board and the court of appeals apply a substantial evidence standard of review, in general, to ALJ decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.306" offset="1162486">And in this case they would apply the same standard of review that a court would normally apply on any ultimate finding of fact, which is to say they will be deferential to the resolution of factual issues by the fact finder.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="263.130" stopTime="270.533">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="263.130" offset="1205745">Does that mean that, as a practical matter, if the ALJ says there's equipoise and there is some evidence on both sides, that that will be accepted?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edward_c_dumont" startTime="270.533" stopTime="364.447">
            <label>Mr. Edward C. DuMont</label>
            <text syncTime="270.533" offset="1235420">Not always.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.032" offset="1245451">It does mean that in many cases... in a case where it's appropriate to apply the rule, it is probable that any one of three decisions would be upheld; decision in favor of either party or decision that the evidence is in equipoise and therefore that the doubt goes to the claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.246" offset="1294248">But it's important to point out that both the Benefits Review Board and the courts of appeals have reversed decisions below applying the "true doubt" rule, on the ground that as in any other ultimate finding of fact, the trier of fact was simply out of line in concluding that the evidence was in equipoise or favored one party or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.661" offset="1363943">Now, the last thing I'd like to point out about the "true doubt" rule and how it applies is that it never... it's important to understand this.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.924" offset="1396962">It never permits a claimant to be awarded benefits without having produced evidence, substantial evidence to support his entitlement under the statute in the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.981" offset="1433220">And it never denies the employer a full and fair opportunity to meet that evidence and to establish that benefits should not be awarded under the statutory criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.290" offset="1470418">The "true doubt" rule grows out of a long tradition of adjudication by the courts primarily under the Longshore Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.459" offset="1503123">You will recall that that Act was passed in 1927, with the district courts primarily the forum for litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.082" offset="1533634">As long ago as 1944, the Second Circuit, in the F. H. McGraw v. Lowe case, upheld an administrative decision on facts remarkably similar to those in the Maher Terminals case.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.561" offset="1575535">In other words, in that case a worker had sustained a head injury at work, developed Parkinson's disease, and the question was whether causation could be shown or inferred.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="364.447" stopTime="368.227">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="364.447" offset="1611061">And there was no reliance there, I take it, on any administrative regulation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edward_c_dumont" startTime="368.227" stopTime="393.999">
            <label>Mr. Edward C. DuMont</label>
            <text syncTime="368.227" offset="1626212">There was no regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.040" offset="1633422">But what there was was an administrative finding by the agency, by the deputy commissioner, that the evidence was essentially in equipoise, that he couldn't tell from the respectable medical opinions in front of him which was the better scientific answer, and that therefore, as a matter of administrative policy, the doubt should be resolved in favor of the claimant because of the remedial purposes of the Act and because the risk of error should be placed on the party best able to bear it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="393.999" stopTime="397.076">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="393.999" offset="1729239">So the court of appeals simply upheld that decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2343.291" offset="9526477">Let me say that there are three provisions in the Department of Labor's regulations way back in 718.300's and 400's, and then there's a published commentary in the Federal Register where the Department of Labor says the burden of proving these things is on the claimant, and where this presumption doesn't apply, the burden of proving is going to be on the claimant, two separate provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.017" offset="9605366">And then they even went so far as to publish commentary in the Federal Register... when the statute was amended and all of these burden-shifting presumptions in Black Lung were repealed in 1981, they published new provisions in the Federal Register and there they said that we want facts now to be decided for the claimants in accordance with the weight of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.321" offset="9690526">Now, they've said that that doesn't mean anything, but it seems to me that when you have a complex of regulations over here that seem to very specifically address these kinds of questions in a way that is fully consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act and the ordinary normal way that adjudications occur, the Department goes over here to a preamble provision which doesn't say what they say it says, by its plain language.</text>

            <text syncTime="3244.410" offset="13130957">And, frankly, I think all you could say about this is the Department of Labor and the Benefits Review Board have narrowed and made this concept much more specific to the rule that's in front of the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.391" offset="13166797">And they're hardly to be faulted for having taken something that was more general and more vague and made it more specific and confined its application.</text>

            <text syncTime="3323.347" offset="13446620">But I think it would be a bit difficult, again, to have a situation where you have burdens of persuasion on two different parties, where that's clearly what Congress contemplated, was that whatever burden they were talking about was going to be on more than one party in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.406" offset="13486849">Finally, I'd like to point out that there's really nothing... there's nothing necessary about calling something an affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.497" offset="13515270">As you pointed out, Justice Scalia, saying that something's an affirmative defense states a conclusion, not some sort of natural fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.479" offset="13539198">In Transportation Management the point was whether or not somebody was liable for a violation of the Federal labor laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.462" offset="13563126">The Labor Board had decided, as a matter of its discretion in administering the statute, to put a burden of proof on one issue involved in deciding that on the employer, and the Court upheld that as a matter of policy, deferring to the Board's judgment and finding that it was reasonable for the Board to take that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.441" offset="13619028">That's why it's called an affirmative defense, because it was reasonable to place the burden of proof on the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.453" offset="13639091">And all it really points out is that you have to look, in every statutory context, at the particular context involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.529" offset="13663437">And in workers' compensation we have a context where of course you want to require, as we do require, the employee to come forward with evidence.</text>
