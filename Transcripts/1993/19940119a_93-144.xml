            <text syncTime="1271.924" offset="5233872">Rather, it's only when a civil measure cannot be explained in terms of a nonpenal purpose, it is only in that case that it should be seen or can be seen as punishment for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1402.811" offset="5757471">The question with a tax is does it have a revenue-raising purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="1813.599" offset="7400573">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.741" offset="7417186">First, I would like to answer Justice Blackmun's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.115" offset="7434636">The answer is that the income of Richard and Judith Kurth was taxed as... income taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.799" offset="7457415">The income received by the Halleys and the younger Kurths from the operation, that is their income as employees, was taxed and paid by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.324" offset="7499524">Moving to the tax as it operates in this... in the State of Montana... well, before I do that, one question posed by Justice Scalia, I think, merits an answer from our perspective, and that is can a tax be called a tax and serve a dual function?</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.790" offset="7589386">And if so, what is the consequence?</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.533" offset="7600357">Well, I think both Halper and Austin were quite clear on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.016" offset="7622300">My position is you can call something it a tax, it can raise revenue and therefore it can be a tax, and it can also punish, and it can be punishment for the purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.492" offset="7668171">And Austin said precisely on that dual-purpose point, fundamentally, even assuming that the statutes in question there served some remedial purpose, the Government's argument must fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.553" offset="7728462">A civil sanction... and they're quoting now from Halper... a civil sanction that cannot be fairly said solely to serve a remedial purpose, but rather can only be explained as also serving either retribution or deterrent purposes, is punishment.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="1912.664" offset="7796902">Because if we don't take that position, then we've put ourselves right back in the old problem of having to... having to define the principal character of the tax again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.811" offset="7845490">I mean we've got the... we would have the same problem we had with the regulatory revenue taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.395" offset="7863776">Different labels, but we'd have the same problem.</text>

            <label>Mr. James H. Goetz</label>
            <text syncTime="1931.076" offset="7870568">Well, exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.288" offset="7875374">And the issue really here, Halper and Austin set aside, is can you have a tax which is, under the guise of a tax, at least in part punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.156" offset="7922813">Because the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits multiple punishment, and so if we return to the fundamental question then we have to ask whether a tax has an aspect of punishment, and if it does then double jeopardy is implicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.705" offset="7989059">Now, turning to the question posed by Justice Stevens, the answer is that... and Mr. Van Tricht I think made this point... that although this is called a tax on possession, this is contraband and it would be seized at the time the Government realizes that the person possesses or stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.183" offset="8094907">Turning to Justice Ginsburg's question on the quantities of the shake, what happened here is they weighed approximately 100 pounds of shake, which is low grade stems and seeds, bags of marijuana product, 100 pounds or 1,600 ounces.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.085" offset="8174528">There were a total of 1,811 ounces in this case, so most of the product was the low-grade shake, approximately 90 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.901" offset="8217787">And that is worth... and the record shows $200.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.966" offset="8238058">Now, the argument here is, well, at retail it might be worth more, and there was evidence in the record of if you used something called the mari-gin you can process it to get some of the higher-quality marijuana out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.953" offset="8282048">But, of course, that would reduce the weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.024" offset="8290303">And so the plain and simple fact is that that was worth $200 and it was taxed at $1,600--</text>

            <text syncTime="2202.674" offset="8956948">Now, looking at the mechanics of this tax... and I've appended the regulations to my brief at the end after page 46.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.661" offset="9004804">And I think the regulations make it quite clear, the nature of this so-called tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.615" offset="9028628">First, if we look at regulation 42.34.101 under definitions, the State defines market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.624" offset="9076693">And market value is the value of the substance at the time of confiscation or report, and the use of the word confiscation I think relates to Justice Stevens' question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.894" offset="9133745">The answer is, of course, this is contraband, and if it's innocently reported, then it will be confiscated or seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.737" offset="9161121">But more importantly... and the theme here is that this truly is not a tax; it's really tied to the criminal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.286" offset="9195394">And if you look down at the next regulation, it talks about the tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.648" offset="9220785">And the last clause is</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.651" offset="9228831">"this return shall be filed within 72 hours of their arrest. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.803" offset="9249415">If you look down at number two, then there is a tax assessment within 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.508" offset="9276269">Within 30 days of what?</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.148" offset="9282852">Within 30 days of the 72 hours after arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.302" offset="9299466">If you look down at number three, quote: At the time of arrest, law-enforcement personnel shall complete the dangerous drug informational reports, information reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.878" offset="9341680">If you look over on the next page it talks about</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.911" offset="9357875">"the law-enforcement officer shall certify and submit the form to the Department within 72 hours of the arrest. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.395" offset="9387760">If you look down at number five, it talks about the form and it talks about information on it, arrest and booking number.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.002" offset="9418271">And if you look at the next regulation down under subpart (c) it talks, quote: The associated criminal nature of assessments under this act is considered to be cause for emergency issue of a warrant of restraint.</text>

            <text syncTime="2352.854" offset="9557660">The tax is not due until 30 days after the assessment, or the assessment is due 72 hours after arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2399.166" offset="9742920">Well, the only evidence we have in this record, and the only forms I've seen in connection with the Montana Dangerous Drug tax, are the reports of the law-enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.703" offset="9789000">I don't think the State has a form of a return.</text>

            <text syncTime="3059.728" offset="12385154">And I think that's quite a different type of review than the challenge is this a tax or is it not a tax.</text>

            <label>Mr. James H. Goetz</label>
            <text syncTime="3067.352" offset="12415665">Well, I agree that that's a different kind of review, but I don't think the question is is this a tax or is it not a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.678" offset="12452968">Because I concede that this can be a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.142" offset="12466760">Indeed, the State says it's a tax and they call it a tax, and they try to raise money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.313" offset="12487449">The question is notwithstanding the fact that it's a tax, may it also serve the dual purpose of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.577" offset="12516497">And the answer, I think, from the structure of this legislation in Montana, is quite clearly it can and it does and it has done so in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.924" offset="12553905">And therefore because we're dealing with a fundamental constitutional right, the Double Jeopardy Clause, following the analogy of Austin v. New Hampshire, I submit that there has to be a heightened standard of review, and there has to be a fairly probing analysis, as we see under Halper even, consistent with the principle of humane justice served the Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.192" offset="12662992">That's my point, not that... generally you don't defer to legislative judgment on taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.876" offset="12685666">I think you defer much less.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.048" offset="12698414">You have a heightened standard of scrutiny when you have a fundamental constitutional right clashing, and here quite clearly you do.</text>

            <text syncTime="3146.273" offset="12731328">But most of the cases in which are relaxed scrutiny, Lenhausen, that group of cases, the challenge has been under the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.975" offset="12794127">And surely the Equal Protection Clause deserves as much constitutional recognition as the Double Jeopardy Clause, doesn't it?</text>

            <label>Mr. James H. Goetz</label>
            <text syncTime="3169.129" offset="12822757">It depends on whether you have a fundamental right or a suspect classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.301" offset="12839371">If you do involve... Yes.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="3175.144" offset="12846790">Well, you say... you say the Equal Protection Clause generally isn't of the same statue or stature in the Constitution as the Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>

            <label>Mr. James H. Goetz</label>
            <text syncTime="3182.838" offset="12877614">Well, this Court has held in numerous cases that you apply at least a two-tier standard in Equal Protection Clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.524" offset="12912305">Rational basis or minimal scrutiny in most cases, but where there's a fundamental right or a suspect classification involved, then you apply heightened scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.580" offset="12948563">So I would say double jeopardy is equivalent to the suspect classification/fundamental right analysis of equal protection, but not generally so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.566" offset="12992448">In other words, I'm not sure you can generalize about equal protection because of that two-tier approach that this Court has taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.021" offset="13022333">But clearly this Court has said, in Benton v. Maryland and since, that double jeopardy is a fundamental constitutional right, and I think Halper reaffirms that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.449" offset="13067995">And so, following the Austin Privileges and Immunities Clause analysis, I think quite clearly warranted here is a very careful scrutiny of the State tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.077" offset="13122538">Not that it's needed, because I think you can see, just trying to probe on various aspects of attempting to enforce and impose this Montana tax, that it doesn't pass even rational basis or minimal scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.478" offset="13192128">Now, the State argues in that connection cases such as the Sanchez case, and I make the very distinction because Sanchez, dealing with the Federal marijuana tax, Federal marijuana transfer tax, was kind of an amorphous challenge arguing simply that it's a penalty and not a tax, but it didn't involve a double jeopardy issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.127" offset="13310724">Here, of course, we have the clashing double jeopardy value that the Court has to preserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.622" offset="13332667">So I think the Sanchez case is justified as a minimal scrutiny kind of a case because it was an amorphous tax case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.601" offset="13380628">And in any event, in that case this Court said that the Federal tax is punitive, or is deterrent in nature which is the equivalent of punitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.049" offset="13426395">And finally I'll close by simply pointing out apart from the--</text>

            <text syncTime="3327.181" offset="13454920">--That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.712" offset="13457010">My point is you didn't have the countervailing Double Jeopardy Clause problem because there was no previous conviction in Sanchez.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.079" offset="13502568">At least there was none that was raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.711" offset="13509046">There was not a double jeopardy issue raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.481" offset="13516151">Moreover the Court... this Court said specifically in Sanchez that the tax is not dependant on criminal prosecution, and here I think we have a great deal of difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.811" offset="13565471">Now, I've cited in a number of places in my brief the numerous cases, including cases of this Court and cases of lower Federal courts and the State cases, that have basically held what I think is quite obvious, and that is these kinds of taxes on dangerous drugs are... the purpose is, as the Utah Supreme Court said in the Sims case, quote, to punish and deter those in possession of illegal drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.652" offset="13696814">And the Seventh Circuit said years ago about the Federal marijuana tax is Tovar v. Jarecki, quote: Does anyone suppose that the Government is trying to raise revenue in either instance?</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.601" offset="13744566">Is it not perfectly plain that the Government is trying... what the Government is trying to do is take the plaintiff's property and turn him and his family out on the street for not having a license to do something the Government did not want him to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.810" offset="13805484">And there are numerous cases from other State jurisdictions to the same point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.354" offset="13827635">So I respectfully submit that we have a case here where the individuals have been punished first, then for the same offense the State is trying to invoke a quasi-criminal process to punish them a second time, and the lower courts were quite clearly correct in dismissing because of double jeopardy problems.</text>
