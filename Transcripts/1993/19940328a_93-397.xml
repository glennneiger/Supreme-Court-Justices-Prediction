            <text syncTime="54.707" offset="371097">This case is a Commerce Clause challenge to section 144.748 of the revised statutes of Missouri, which imposes an additional use tax of 1-1/2 percent on all goods purchased from out of State for use, storage, or consumption in Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.850" offset="451658">Now, the Missouri overall taxing scheme is thus as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.394" offset="469839">There is a 4.225 State-wide sales tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.757" offset="491260">There is a 4.225 equivalent State-wide use tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.459" offset="510068">The challenged statute adds an additional 1.5 percent use tax to be charged across the State on all transactions from out of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.788" offset="551446">There is no corresponding additional sales tax State-wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.128" offset="568791">Cities and counties and other municipalities within the State, however, are authorized to enact local sales taxes with the approval of the voters.</text>

            <text syncTime="118.968" offset="628142">Now, the result of this unusual statutory scheme is a patchwork taxing scheme within the State of Missouri that has 22 different local sales tax rates, ranging from zero percent in several counties to 3.5 percent in one city, and bear in mind that throughout the whole State, the 1-1/2 percent additional use tax is applicable, so the total use tax applicable throughout the State of Missouri is 5.725 percent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1920.637" offset="7834803">Your Honor, I think Missouri found a better way to accommodate the practical needs of interstate sellers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.892" offset="7867822">Interstate sellers... as this Court is well aware from the Quill case, interstate sellers don't like the varying local rate solution, because it is extremely burdensome for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.180" offset="7908991">To determine for every transaction they sell into the State of Missouri, there are over 1,000 taxable jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.693" offset="7931038">They would have to determine for each transaction the applicable current use tax rate for that transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.205" offset="7949115">So that's one reason, and it wasn't... Missouri didn't do this out of an altruistic sense to benefit interstate sellers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.131" offset="7972729">I don't want to make that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.681" offset="7978999">But States realized that, to the extent a tax is easy to comply with by a taxpayer, it's more efficient to collect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.107" offset="8012644">We get a greater... we can collect a greater percentage of our taxes by setting a State-wide rate, because all interstate sellers now selling into Missouri know exactly what their tax is on a use tax basis, so that's one of the reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.885" offset="8055799">Another reason is, the identical use and tax rates in each jurisdiction approach, well, it doesn't solve the constitutional problem that Mr. Walsh has tried to point out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.362" offset="8101670">It doesn't guarantee equal treatment in each and every instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.234" offset="8117134">For example, suppose Missouri adopted that system, and you had a resident of a local jurisdiction who wanted to purchase a washing machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.378" offset="8145764">He happened to live in a jurisdiction where the local use tax rates and sales tax rates were high.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.882" offset="8167812">Well, he would have essentially three options.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.634" offset="8178783">He could purchase from a local vendor and pay a high local sales tax rate, or he could purchase from an out-of-State vendor and pay the equally high local use tax rate, or he could travel to another local jurisdiction in Missouri and pay a low sales tax rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.984" offset="8240223">Well, from the out-of-State seller's perspective, that out-of-State seller is at the precise competitive disadvantage in that situation as he is under our present system, so Missouri recognized that going to this identical rate in each jurisdiction solution doesn't cure any supposed inequality that might exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.105" offset="8308664">So to accommodate the needs of interstate sellers, and to make it more practical, admittedly, also from the State's perspective, it's easier for the State to administer on a State-wide basis, so those are the reasons Missouri went to that system.</text>

            <text syncTime="2139.990" offset="8712204">And my point is not that this Court should necessarily defer to Congress, but that in these difficult practical issues of State taxation... the Court in Quill expressly recognized that Congress may well be better equipped to address some of these issues than this Court, and that was one of the reasons the Quill court chose not to overrule the Bellas Hess case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.583" offset="8790571">That case provided a bright line rule that States could use in devising their tax systems.</text>

            <text syncTime="3009.994" offset="12192236">First, the Court observed and reaffirmed the Bellas Hess case in large part because it viewed Bellas Hess as providing a bright line rule here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.750" offset="12235286">As I mentioned before, the Court now has an opportunity to provide another bright line rule that would greatly aid States in devising tax systems that they could be sure would satisfy the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.417" offset="12281888">The identical treatment in each and every instance approach, the problem, from the State's perspective, of that approach is the State would have to be clairvoyant and try to imagine a possible contingency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.875" offset="12327759">Well, could we have any possible area of unequal treatment?</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.068" offset="12340507">I dare say that the States that have adopted the identical use and sales tax rates in each local jurisdiction probably thought that they had solved the constitutional problem of... that if there was a constitutional problem, they have outlawed any unequal treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.038" offset="12396409">Well, the example that I gave you a few minutes ago shows that that system can result in the same kind of instances of unequal treatment that our system has, so it would be much easier for the State to say, listen, we have a tax on interstate commerce, we have a tax on intrastate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.717" offset="12459103">As long as the tax on interstate commerce is not greater than the tax on local commerce, on an average basis, the tax is constitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="3130.342" offset="12673621">The second point I'd like to make from the Quill case is, the Court recognized that the critical importance of the doctrine of stare decisis in the area of State taxation, for at least 67 years, the overall burden approach has been firmly embedded in this Court's precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.906" offset="12751884">For the Court now to change that rule would raise all sorts of new questions and undoubtedly engender substantial litigation over the validity of a whole host of State taxes that had been enacted during that time period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.543" offset="12802457">I would submit that the Court need not open that can of worms here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.326" offset="12817503">The third point I wanted to make about Quill is the point I made before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.359" offset="12837670">Congress has plenary power in this area, as the Court recognized in Quill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.702" offset="12851044">If it wanted to, it could outlaw the Missouri system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.921" offset="12859926">It has chosen not to for the last 67 years... the overall burden approach... and so therefore I would respectfully submit that unless there is a clear, adverse effect on interstate commerce overall, the Court should be hesitant to exercise its jurisdiction in this area.</text>

            <text syncTime="3309.619" offset="13390734">--Well, the principle is that a taxing system that treats a use tax and a sales tax differently is now and forever discriminatory and facially invalid, and it's not General American that controls that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.848" offset="13443606">General American was not a use tax case, was not even a modern type of compensatory tax case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.802" offset="13463459">It was more an equal protection case than a Commerce Clause case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.146" offset="13484879">The law in this area, if you want to talk about stare decisis and the bright line, the stare decisis and the bright line come from Silas Mason and the Halliburton case, and in Halliburton the Court said,</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.103" offset="13532631">"The conclusion is inescapable. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.332" offset="13537542">"Equal treatment for in-State and out-of-State taxpayers similarly situated is the condition precedent for a valid use tax on goods imported from out of State. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.351" offset="13585608">That's a bright line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.783" offset="13591355">That's the line that the State of Missouri for its own reasons decided to cross in this case and experiment with a new type of taxation which, if permitted by this Court, I suggest could lead to all sorts of abuses and, in fact, some of the amici are sort of champing at the bit to see whether the opinion of the Court in this case will open some new loopholes in use tax regulation which, since 1937 in the Silas Mason case, have been closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.409" offset="13701905">The bright line is desirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.391" offset="13713817">The bright line is equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.743" offset="13719250">The State of Missouri either can enact either local sales and use taxes at the State level, or it can delegate to the States... to the subdivisions the right to enact local sales and use taxes, as 28 States, other than Missouri, have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.034" offset="13788422">You're right, Justice Souter, they are a pioneer... I guess, Justice Scalia... they are trying to be a pioneer here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.939" offset="13812037">We think that's illegal.</text>
