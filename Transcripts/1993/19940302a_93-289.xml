            <label>Mr. Drew S. Days, III</label>
            <text syncTime="9.356" offset="185535">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.434" offset="217823">On November 5th, 1990, the President signed into law the Defense Base Closure Act at issue in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.107" offset="248543">The 1990 Act was the product of vigorous efforts on the part of both the Congress and the President to remove partisan and procedural obstacles that historically had made it nearly impossible to achieve a timely and orderly close of domestic military bases deemed unnecessary to the national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.390" offset="321686">The compromise arrived at by the legislative and executive branches with respect to this particular issue embodied several critical features.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.997" offset="360033">First, the President was to be held personally responsible for the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.579" offset="378424">Secondly, there would be extensive congressional oversight and involvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.512" offset="402143">Third, there would be an independent commission established to make recommendations to the President, and there would be a single indivisible package made available to the President by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.881" offset="451566">The entire process would be one that would be completed within a 6-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.007" offset="480092">Central to this process was that it would remove concern for what was referred to as cherry-picking.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.611" offset="510499">That is a practice that contributed to the criticism of the pre-1990 base closure actions and impasses between the Congress and the President, where on a base closing list one particular base would be picked out and removed from that particular determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.403" offset="577686">Between April 15th and July 30th, 1991, as... insofar as this lawsuit is concerned, every party had completed what was required of that party under the 1990 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.901" offset="631707">The Secretary of Defense had made his recommendation for base closures and realignments, and the Commission had held hearings on 82 closures or realignments.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.089" offset="680399">The President had approved the entire list and transmitted it to Congress, and Congress, having held hearings on that particular list, had declined to enact a Joint Resolution of Disapproval.</text>

            <text syncTime="154.354" offset="765454">I guess the President has to either approve the entire list or reject the entire list.</text>

            <label>Mr. Drew S. Days, III</label>
            <text syncTime="214.932" offset="1007766">There is nothing in the statute that reflects that power on the part of the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.417" offset="1025738">Of course, the President appoints the Commission after consultation with both sides of the aisle in the Congress, but there is no direct supervision by the President of the activities of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.852" offset="1067534">The Congress, however, does have a very active role to play in this process.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.235" offset="1084984">There are at least 10 points in the process where Congress has a role to play, starting with the appointment of the Commission itself, and moving through the point where Congress has the ability to enact a Joint Resolution of Disapproval.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.635" offset="1142662">So that one would presume that... although it's not explicit in the statute, that Congress could make its views known during this entire process.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.450" offset="1181846">And, indeed, I think the facts were that Congress did make its views known from time to time, leading up to this base closure decision.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="266.246" offset="1213088">General Days, the normal presumption is that legislation and its operation will be subject to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.483" offset="1258019">There's no express preclusion in this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.255" offset="1277140">Can you summarize for us your argument of why the absence of judicial review is implicit in this scheme?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="drew_s_days_iii" startTime="291.622" stopTime="350.009">
            <label>Mr. Drew S. Days, III</label>
            <text syncTime="291.622" offset="1314548">Yes, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.645" offset="1322698">You're certainly right that the presumption exists in favor of judicial review, but I don't think the Court has ever held that that presumption and the use of the term "clear and convincing evidence" was designed to impose an evidentiary standard in the sense that we would be talking about if we were talking about parties and the shifting of burdens.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.546" offset="1406290">But we think that even given that presumption of review, it is weaker in a situation such as this where military sensitivities are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.946" offset="1451847">When one is talking about, we must remember, a decision by the Secretary of Defense as to what are the military needs of the United States over a 6-year period, and then trying to work out a closure process that is consistent with that particular determination, and it is a decision ultimately by the President acting in, among other things, his capacity as commander in chief.</text>

            <text syncTime="350.009" offset="1548082">Well, might this be different, General Days, if some sort of individual rights in the traditional sense were involved, as they don't seem to be here?</text>

            <text syncTime="358.537" offset="1582250">Certainly, Chief Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.627" offset="1594580">The U.S. Reports reflect the fact that there have been occasions where this Court has exercised jurisdiction, or lower Federal courts have exercised jurisdiction where there was an identifiable right, either a common-law right or a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.780" offset="1663230">But I think one searches in vain in this case to identify such a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.244" offset="1685068">There is not a common-law right.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.854" offset="1691442">And, indeed, the Third Circuit rejected the notion that there was a constitutional right presented by this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.507" offset="1714117">There was an assertion in the complaint of a due process violation flowing out of some of the errors that the plaintiffs identify, the respondents identify, but the Third Circuit rejected that particular claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.857" offset="1767511">And, as I understand it, respondents now are pressing their constitutional claim, their due process claim, before this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="419.567" offset="1826339">That's correct, Justice Souter.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.869" offset="1839504">This was the result of a very long period in which the Congress and the President, for a variety of reasons, found themselves unable to agree upon how base closures should be handled.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.768" offset="1891122">In 1988 there was an act that pointed in the same direction as this 1990 Act, but it was for 1 year.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.543" offset="1918290">This particular act incorporated many of those features that the Congress and the President felt had worked well, that had removed most of the avenues for political maneuvering and obstruction, procedural obstruction, which had really prevented the Government from doing what I think everyone recognized needed to be done, given the enormous costs that are incurred when an obsolete base is kept open year after year, and also when it's not needed for the protection of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.571" offset="2034378">So we see this very much as an understanding between the President and the Congress as to how to do this most effectively, and I mentioned--</text>

            <text syncTime="493.216" offset="2120895">The answer that you're now giving to Justice Souter seems to be that this was a determination between the two branches, that this was a matter for them to determine, perhaps--</text>

            <text syncTime="508.906" offset="2183694">I just wanted to respond to your point about the presumption, and I think the presumption is weaker under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.707" offset="2206890">But I think the history and the structure and purpose of the Act also suggests that judicial review was not viewed by the Congress or anticipated by the Congress as an appropriate way to deal with whatever problems might have arisen under the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1235.018" offset="5088197">Well, we think this case is controlled by this Court's decision in Franklin v. Massachusetts, that what we have here, apart from the fact that the President wasn't named as a defendant, is basically an effort to get courts to review presidential action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.685" offset="5142845">This is a situation where the Secretary of Defense and the Commission agencies make nonbinding recommendations to the President and then the President has the discretion to decide what he's going to do under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.295" offset="5201255">As the Third Circuit said, the President can make his decision for any reason at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.820" offset="5219331">This is discretion that is not bound by the terms of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.600" offset="5234482">Although the argument has been made by the respondents that this is somehow different from Franklin, we've never viewed Franklin as a decision about artful pleading, but rather about the respect for the integrity of the presidential process or presidential action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.551" offset="5298326">And so we think given this Court's decision in Franklin v. Massachusetts, this case falls very nicely into that particular framework, and therefore it is important that the President is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.900" offset="5347645">This is a situation where he has more discretion than I think this Court recognized in Franklin in making the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.474" offset="5377947">So if anything, this is a stronger case for deference by the judiciary to Presidential action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1358.347" offset="5581493">And one of the reasons for that is the involvement of Congress, the need for expedition, the fact that in this legislation Congress recognized that the NEPA process was one that had been used for a variety of reasons to delay the process, and therefore NEPA was completely taken out of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1393.271" offset="5721196">In other words, I don't see it as an argument that what Congress intended to do was take NEPA out but allow other types of procedural challenges to be reviewed by the courts, but rather as a determination that NEPA imposes certain procedural requirements on agencies that, apart from judicial review, can be used to slow down, delay the process that Congress wanted to be handled in an expeditious fashion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3181.623" offset="12874567">Mr. Chief Justice and the Court, Senator Specter refers to a fair process, but I think it's important to emphasize that what Congress had in mind was a fair process that would result in a timely closure of bases, so it's the relationship between fairness and timeliness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.453" offset="12985849">And I think the fairness in the Act comes from several sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.933" offset="12999850">One, it's fair to Congress because it involves Congress in an intimate way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.067" offset="13016360">The President is on the line, which means that he's not a person who can hide behind the decisions that are made.</text>

            <text syncTime="3226.083" offset="13052409">But there's also a concern for communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.144" offset="13060664">The Act itself has a provision that deals with the problems of transition once decisions are made with respect to closing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.670" offset="13090757">Getting back to the question of whether the statute authorizes judicial review, we think the fast-track procedure indicates an absence of judicial review expectations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.440" offset="13141852">The 45 days given to Congress, the 2 hour debate, there is an opportunity for any Member of the Congress to bring to a vote a Joint Resolution of Disapproval.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.744" offset="13183021">But we think that what the statute reflects is the decision to give to the President and the Congress the ability to weigh the seriousness of alleged procedural violations against the need to proceed with the entire package.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.166" offset="13244775">Mr. Specter refers to the sense of Congress resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.026" offset="13260135">I won't get into that, but we refer to it on page 17 of our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.240" offset="13277062">And I think that resolution ultimately reflects the approval by the Congress of the recommendations made by the Base Closing Commission in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.128" offset="13316559">On the question of unconstitutionality, as I understand unconstitutionality under these circumstances, it would have to mean that Congress could not authorize the President to do what the President did in this case, which was to approve the package, even though that was consistent with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.239" offset="13389075">For the foregoing reasons, we ask this Court to reverse the decision of the court of appeals, thereby permitting the base closure process that the President and the Congress agreed upon in the 1990 Act to go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.697" offset="13442887">We think to do otherwise would disrupt the careful balance struck between the political branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.551" offset="13466293">It would intrude on Congress' statutory oversight role and it would make expedition and finality impossible to achieve in an area of national security and military policy uniquely within the competence of Congress and the President.</text>
