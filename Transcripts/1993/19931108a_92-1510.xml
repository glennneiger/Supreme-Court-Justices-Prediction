            <text syncTime="303.244" offset="1360234">The law that came in had the amendment that brought in 16-1-60(b) that changed the definition of a violent crime, the offender to whom would be considered a violent offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.142" offset="1403806">But then the part that was stuck in was stuck in in 266 to make that one specific section retroactive, where the rest of the statute was prospective.</text>

            <text syncTime="388.372" offset="1700766">The change in an interval between a parole consideration hearing from 1 year to 2 years does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.457" offset="1737128">The change involves a part of procedure that is involved in the parole decision making process.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.122" offset="1763773">In other words, in South Carolina this is a change which is involved in a form of clemency in the State of South Carolina.</text>

            <text syncTime="420.424" offset="1828975">Under the proposition that I am saying, I think that it would not make any difference because if the Ex Post Facto Clause does not apply, then it would not make any difference in terms of an ex post facto analysis of whether or not there was a hearing in 1 year or 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.024" offset="1895326">The Fourth Circuit's reasoning making the change in the interval between parole consideration hearings a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause presents a large number of other problems for a state such as South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.943" offset="1951019">For example, would an increase in the board size constitute a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause, or would a change from a majority vote to a 2/3 majority vote violate the Ex Post Facto Clause, or what about a smaller change like from 21 months to 2 years violate the Ex Post Facto Clause?</text>
            <text syncTime="470.828" offset="2030536">It is my position that none of these changes, including a change from 1 year to 2 years in the frequency of parole consideration hearings violates the Ex Post Facto Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="736.235" offset="3092256">The Akins case v. Snow I think has been, there are two problems with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.550" offset="3117438">One of them is a question of whether or not the Ex Post Facto Clause applies at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.713" offset="3134157">The second problem is that in the Akins case the Eleventh Circuit took the position that the Georgia statute, the way it was written made the interval between parole considerations a part of parole eligibility, and then took the position that the Ex Post Facto Clause applies to parole eligibility and since the Georgia statute intended to make the interval between parole considerations a part of parole eligibility, that it violated the Ex Post Facto Clause and they struck it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.307" offset="3232482">The problem for all of these cases, the Snow case, Akin v. Snow, and a large number of other cases is that the circuits are not in agreement and there is disagreement between the district courts and the circuit courts, the courts of appeal, and between the courts of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.557" offset="3289533">If this Court were to take a clear statement and say whether or not the Ex Post Facto Clause applies at all to these parole eligibility procedures, this problem would be resolved and we wouldn't have these kinds of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.926" offset="3338957">That's the position that I am taking here.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.707" offset="3350137">Another thing in the Collins case, in the concurring opinion to the Collins case this Court set forth a test that might be looked at to determine whether or not a procedure actually violated or implicated the Ex Post Facto Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.426" offset="3408965">That test is this, that you look at the procedure from the time when the act was committed, and if that procedure changes the obtaining of a valid conviction or sentence then the Ex Post Facto Clause is implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.429" offset="3476988">From there the analysis would go to whether or not there was a substantial disadvantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.070" offset="3491512">Well, when you do that, if you go back to the time when the respondent committed his crime and you look at the procedural change, the change in the frequency between parole consideration hearings hasn't got anything to do with obtaining a valid conviction or the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.658" offset="3549922">His sentence is not altered by whether or not he has gained parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.782" offset="3566431">He has... in this state he has absolutely no expectation of parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.405" offset="3580851">That is part of his argument that he says makes him go into 1983, is the fact that... but he hasn't shown any entitlement to a fixed hearing date.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.901" offset="3622856">There is no constitutional protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.463" offset="3629125">This Court said in the Greenholtz case, Greenholtz v. the Inmates of Nebraska Penal Commission, this Court said that there was no constitutional right nor inherent right to be released conditionally prior to the expiration of a sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.174" offset="3699969">And so the position that this Court has taken all the way through, I have been unable to find, nor have I seen anything cited in this case, in the jurisprudence of this Court anything that is contrary that in anyway would implicate the Ex Post Facto Clause in this analysis.</text>

            <text syncTime="919.734" offset="3826193">The legislature replaced that scheme by putting in a discretionary good time credit scheme, and even though the amount of good time credit might have been greater under the discretionary scheme it required affirmative acts on the part of the inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.955" offset="3883035">Under the prior scheme it required no acts, and the result was that their sentence in absolute terms would be shortened.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.488" offset="3909262">So this Court held that the Ex Post Facto Clause was involved, but again we're talking about an actual reduction in sentence whereas with paroling in South Carolina, if you are granted parole it is not a reduction in sentence.</text>

            <label>Mr. W. Gaston Fairey</label>
            <text syncTime="1422.935" offset="5838980">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.098" offset="5863639">First as to the mootness issue, I find myself somewhat torn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.263" offset="5884328">We were successful in the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.694" offset="5894046">This was a pro se complaint by a prisoner who was denied parole initially and then told rather than the 1-year period he had to wait for reconsideration he had to wait 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.792" offset="5934483">He then brought a habeas, excuse me, a 1983 action in district court, pro se, lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.867" offset="5962696">Appealed it pro se to the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.929" offset="5970950">The Fourth Circuit called and asked would I consider being appointed and take the case on his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.683" offset="5989967">The Fourth Circuit found that the change from the 1 year to the 2 year violated the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.509" offset="6017344">That conflicted with a South Carolina Supreme Court case called Gunter in which both the state and the Federal Ex Post Facto Clauses were considered and found that that 1 to 2 year change was not a substantive change, therefore it did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.818" offset="6090487">The Fourth Circuit, as I said, reversed, and that is how we are here now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.901" offset="6106892">Since that reversal by the Fourth Circuit certain things have occurred which have been initiated by the state, by both the legislative branch of the state and the judicial branch of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.510" offset="6161331">Only the executive branch of the State of South Carolina has not accepted the judgment of the Roller court of the Fourth Circuit as to ex post facto and the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.076" offset="6199574">First the legislature, as we have found out, has amended the statute and in effect accorded all individuals sentenced under the old scheme their rights consistent with the ruling in Roller.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.926" offset="6250983">Secondly, the South Carolina Supreme Court reconsidered their ruling in Gunter in Griffin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.279" offset="6272403">And they did not feel compelled to do so, they were aware at that time that Roller was pending before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.552" offset="6301452">As a matter of fact the state petitioned for rehearing based upon this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.346" offset="6316603">The South Carolina Supreme Court specifically held that they were convinced by the ruling in Roller that it was consistent with their understanding of what ex post facto, at least now what ex post facto means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.303" offset="6372505">That case was brought and the ruling was consistent with both the state and the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.169" offset="6399985">As a matter of fact, they used the little case ex post facto rather than the Ex Post Facto Clause usually used when referring to the constitutional provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.115" offset="6435721">So it is our position that while this case may be moot or close to moot, it is done by the state and the usual remedy applicable that the state has cited, the Munsingwear case and the Los Angeles v. Davis case, is not appropriate for this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1619.919" offset="6626937">In Munsingwear this Court indicated that if one party takes steps to cause the ending of the case, they can't complain when it is used against them in res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.249" offset="6672286">Here the state has accepted the ruling of the Fourth Circuit, both the executive and the legislative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.881" offset="6698826">Now they want to make this case moot, yet they want no precedent against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.355" offset="6716694">The usual remedy is to remand to the Fourth Circuit and to order them to dismiss the action as if it never occurred, which obviously would have no precedential effect if the South Carolina legislature were in February to decide to change the law back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.795" offset="6782418">Mr. Roller, unless the South Carolina Supreme Court were to indicate that it was based upon, their ruling was based upon the state constitution, would be back in the same position again.</text>
