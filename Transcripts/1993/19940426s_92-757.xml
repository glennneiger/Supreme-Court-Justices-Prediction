            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="5.786" offset="114093">The Civil Rights Act of 1991 is a major piece of federal legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.773" offset="138021">When it enacted that statute, Congress provided additional remedies for civil rights violations and affectively overruled seven of this Court's decisions interpreting earlier civil rights statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.509" offset="184937">Despite the importance of the legislation and unlike the 1990 version of the statute which President Bush had vetoed, the 1991 Act is silent on the question whether most of its provisions apply to cases that arose before November 19, 1991, the date the statue became affective.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.242" offset="263932">The two cases, that I have to announce this morning, present questions concerning the retroactivity of two sections of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.567" offset="293189">The Landgraf case, which comes to us from the Fifth Circuit, involves Section 102 which creates a right to recover compensatory and punitive damages for certain violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and it further provides that any party may demand a trial by jury if such damages are sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.241" offset="375945">The Rivers case, which comes to us from the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, involves Section 101 which expands the scope of the 1866 Civil Rights Act's prohibition against racial discrimination in the making and enforcement of contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.706" offset="437803">In each of these cases, we agree with the Court of Appeals that the statutory provision at issue should not be applied retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.222" offset="471866">The principal submission of both petitioners is based on the text of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.191" offset="491719">They argue that the expressed preclusion of retroactive application in two sections of the Act gives rise to a negative implication that Congress intended the remainder of the Act to apply to pending cases that arose before the Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.497" offset="552950">Although this argument has some force, it seems implausible to us that Congress would resolve the important matter of retroactivity through negative inferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.777" offset="594015">We ultimately reject the argument relying in part on legislative history disclosing that Congress omitted from the 1991 Act the kind of explicit retroactivity provision that it had included in the 1990 Bill that was vetoed by President Bush.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.015" offset="662978">Because the text of the 1991 Act does not resolve the retroactivity issues, we rest our decisions on judicial presumptions governing the temporal reach of statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.373" offset="704461">A presumption against statutory retroactivity has deep roots in our jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.452" offset="724732">In decisions spanning two centuries, the court has declined to interpret new statutes so as to impose new legally disadvantages on past acts unless Congress clearly intended that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.014" offset="774991">We are not satisfied that the presumption reach retroactivity applies to the provisions at issue in the Landgraf case.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.487" offset="800905">Although employment discrimination has been forbidden since long before 1991, the new damages remedies of the 1991 Act attached new legal burdens to a Title VII violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.292" offset="848134">If applied to conduct occurring before their enactment, the new damages provisions would, thus, operate retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.356" offset="876346">Moreover, because the new jury trial right is only available for plaintiffs seeking damages, that provision likewise applies only in cases arising after November 21, 1991.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.801" offset="926188">In the Rivers case, the petitioners advance an argument that was not available in Landgraf.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.964" offset="946772">They contend that Section 101 of the 1991 Act applies to pending cases because Congress unquestionably intended to overrule this Court's construction of the 1866 Act in Patterson against Mclean Credit Union, and to restore the broader understanding of the law that had prevailed in the Courts of Appeals before Paterson was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.112" offset="1035380">We disagree with that submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.432" offset="1044679">When Congress responds to a judicial decision, it may wish to make the responding statute retroactive in order to limit the effects of a ruling with which it disagrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.878" offset="1086475">However, Congress' decision to overrule one of their cases does not of itself demonstrate an intent to legislate retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.084" offset="1123256">Clear evidence of a specific legislative intention to make the new statute retroactive is still required.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.653" offset="1149587">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals in each of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.164" offset="1167559">Justice Scalia, joined by Justices Kennedy and Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, and Justice Blackmun has filed dissenting opinions in both cases.</text>
