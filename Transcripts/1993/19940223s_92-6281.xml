            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="90989">The second case is Hagen against Utah which comes to us on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.179" offset="123694">The petitioner, Hagen, a Native American was charged in Utah State Court with distributing a controlled substance in the Town of Myton, Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.972" offset="166849">Myton is within the original boundaries of the Uintah Indian Reservation, but it is situated on land that was opened to non-Indian settlement in 1905.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.530" offset="213033">The State Appellate Court relying on a prior decision of the Tenth Circuit held that Myton was an "Indian country" as that term is defined by statute and, therefore, that the State Courts lack jurisdiction over the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.477" offset="272801">The Utah Supreme Court reversed holding that Congress had diminished the reservation boundaries by opening the reservation to non-Indian settlement and that Myton was outside the boundaries of the present reservation and, thus, petitioner's offense was subject to state criminal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.062" offset="359214">In an opinion filed today with the Clerk, we affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.910" offset="374574">We decline to consider petitioner's argument that the State of Utah should be collaterally estopped from relitigating the reservation boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.239" offset="407907">That argument was not presented in the petition for writ of certiorari and indeed, was expressly disavowed by petitioner at an earlier stage in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.717" offset="449807">On the merits, prior decisions have established that three factors are relevant to the determination whether Congress has diminished a reservation boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.104" offset="499335">We look to the statutory language used opening the Indian lands to settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.786" offset="522114">We looked to the contemporaneous understanding of that statute and we look to the subsequent demographics of the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.503" offset="560984">Any ambiguities are resolved in favor of the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.790" offset="578120">In this case, a 1902 statute provided that the open lands shall be restored to the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.068" offset="611244">This language evidences a congressional purpose to terminate reservation status to that land.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.493" offset="644889">This baseline intent to diminish was not changed by the subsequent passage of the 1905 statute that actually opened the reservation lands for settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.967" offset="686790">The statutory language and structure, we think, requires that the two Acts be read together.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.295" offset="712076">The historical evidence clearly indicates the contemporaneous understanding that the reservation would be diminished in size.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.792" offset="746140">Finally, practical acknowledgment that the reservation was diminished is demonstrated by the current population demographics in the disputed area.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.599" offset="785324">Justice Blackmun has filed a dissenting opinion which Justice Souter has joined</text>
