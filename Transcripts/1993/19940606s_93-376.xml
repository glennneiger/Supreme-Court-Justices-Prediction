            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="91005">The second case that I have to announce, Key Tronic Corporation against the United States, arises out of the dispute between two of the parties responsible for pollution of a landfill site in the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.547" offset="145131">Both Key Tronic and the United States Air force dump liquid chemicals in the landfill.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.317" offset="168223">In litigation with the Washington State Department of Ecology and the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, Key Tronic agreed to contribute over $4 million to the cost of cleaning up the site.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.339" offset="216288">In this action, Key Tronic seeks to recover a significant portion of those costs from the United States Air Force because it was also partially responsible for the pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.949" offset="254741">The specific question we have to decide is whether in such an action one responsible party may recover its attorney's fees from another.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.341" offset="288282">The amount at issue is approximately $1.2 million for fees that covered three different types of services: First, the identification of other potentially responsible parties, including the Air Force, that was liable for the pollution; second, the preparation and negotiation of a settlement agreement with the EPA; and finally, that fees incurred in the prosecution of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.476" offset="384830">For reasons stated in an opinion filed with the Clerk, we hold that fees of the first of those three types of services are recoverable but the others are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.889" offset="418476">Justice Scalia has filed an opinion dissenting in part in which he has joined by Justice Blackmun and Justice Thomas.</text>
