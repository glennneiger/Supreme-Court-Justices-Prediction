            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="9.006" offset="186326">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.359" offset="199806">At issue in this case is whether Federal or State law determines the elements and the defenses of a negligence claim brought by the FDIC as receiver for a savings and loan against an outside attorney for that savings and loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.240" offset="263335">The case arises out of the petitioner's assisting in the preparation of two private placement memoranda for American Diversified Savings Bank over the period from September through December of 1985.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.567" offset="308580">During and prior to that time, two individuals named Sahni and Day, who owned 100 percent of ADSB, were engaged and had been for some time in fraudulent and other illegal activities which eventually resulted in Federal and State regulators placing ADSB into receivership.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.449" offset="380155">None of the O'Melveny lawyers was aware of any of the illegal acts, nor are they alleged to have been, nor of ADSB's financial or regulatory problems and, indeed, the ADSB officers concealed this information from the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.638" offset="432922">The Ninth Circuit created two Federal rules of decision: first, that the knowledge of ADSB's 100 percent owners was not imputed to ADSB, and second, that the FDIC can avoid defenses to tort claims that would be good against the predecessor, ADSB.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.612" offset="516828">In response to an argument by the petitioner pointing out certain provisions of State law, the Ninth Circuit stated as follows, and this is a quote:</text>
            <text syncTime="100.759" offset="553399">"The flaw in O'Melveny's argument is the law O'Melveny assumes applies. "</text>
            <text syncTime="105.691" offset="573043">"It is now clear beyond doubt that Federal, not State, law governs the application of defenses against the FDIC. "</text>

            <text syncTime="205.775" offset="973448">Well, the case certainly could be decided on the ground that under Federal common law as it existed... and we discussed this briefly in our reply brief... as it existed prior to Erie v. Tompkins, we think we would win this case, but the clearer... the ground on which certiorari was granted, and I think the clearer and the easier way to decide the case, is to decide the issue of State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.761" offset="1069370">Now, the other question that you asked, Justice Ginsburg, was whether the Ninth Circuit had decided this on the basis of State or Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.856" offset="1093716">It is clear to me they decided it on the basis of Federal law, for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.158" offset="1106986">The first is that that's what they said they were doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.241" offset="1123286">The language that I just quoted said the flaw in O'Melveny's argument is its assumption that State law applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.988" offset="1154320">It is now clear that Federal law applies to all defenses... not just defense, but defenses... in a suit brought by the FDIC, and the second is what they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.103" offset="1198728">The opinion relies on three Federal opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.948" offset="1222134">It does not rely on State law, and in an analogous context... Michigan v. Long... this Court said that when the opinion relies on Federal decisions, then they are applying Federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="308.946" offset="1386078">The only thing I would say in that respect, Justice Scalia, is that I would invite careful consideration of four cases that are cited in our brief, and those four cases make it very clear... it's probably best summarized by the West American case and by Mr. Witkin, who is the leading commentator on California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.318" offset="1463610">The Government points out, quite correctly, that there is an exception to the general rule of imputation in those instants where the agent is acting adversely to the principal, but in the clearest language of the which the English dictionary is capable, it then goes on to say... in the clearest words of which the English language is capable, it then goes on to say that there is an exception to the exception, and that the exception to the exception applies in those instances where the agent is in fact acting on behalf of its principal, and there is no doubt that that's what happened here.</text>

            <text syncTime="525.311" offset="2251567">The first is that the right... the word is not claims, it's rights, and you don't have a right unless you have a claim and there are no defenses to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.146" offset="2282914">The second is provided... the second reason is provided by this Court's decision in Holmes.</text>

            <text syncTime="550.958" offset="2354176">And under California law, the reason that there is no proximate causation is because justifiable reliance is a required element of proximate causation, and there was no justifiable reliance where all you are saying is, should the O'Melveny lawyers have told Sahni and Day that they were... discovered that Sahni and Day were violating the law and then told them so?</text>

            <text syncTime="625.186" offset="2651032">If you didn't have the specific statute, the mere existence of FIRREA, with its comprehensiveness, this 370-page statute controls the issue of whether State or Federal law governs under this Court's decision in City of Milwaukee v. Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.169" offset="2726996">Involved in that case was a comprehensive statute, the 1972 amendments to the Clean Water Act, and the question was, when you have that kind of statute, which supplants preexisting State rules in some instances and leaves them in place in other instances, is it then the proper function for the Federal courts to come along behind and displace State law in those instances where Congress elected to leave them in place?</text>
            <text syncTime="674.070" offset="2846637">The Government's only answer to that City of Milwaukee argument is that FIRREA is not in fact comprehensive, and that, with all due respect, is borderline laughable.</text>

            <text syncTime="750.170" offset="3151015">In the second place, it involved a note, an asset as opposed to a mere claim, and the third... as I read D'Oench, heavy reliance was placed on the fact that between the time the conduct occurred and the time the decision was reached, there was a Federal statute that was actually enacted, and that Federal statute heavily influenced the decision so that what the Court was really doing was filling in a vacuum that existed in between the time of the conduct and the time of the decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="837.027" offset="3498444">If I may tie that to our Kimbell Foods analysis, and that's the third reason... that's the third reason that this case must be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.083" offset="3534702">One of the three Kimbell Foods factors has to do with whether there is a need for a particular Federal rule in the particular instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.239" offset="3579319">The only argument that the Government even makes with respect to why a special Federal rule is needed here is the more money argument, that because otherwise it would deplete the Deposit Insurance Fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.720" offset="3645252">I cannot emphasize too strongly that this argument that the application of Federal law will result in the FDIC recovering more money is entitled to no weight at all, and I'm going to tie this back to your taxpayer's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.072" offset="3710663">Kimbell Foods itself rejected that very argument, and it did so on two grounds that are highly relevant to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.158" offset="3746921">The first one is that in this case as in Kimbell Foods the relevant statute provides other means, other than just getting more money into the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund, for protecting the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.726" offset="3801255">These include the ability of the Federal regulators to increase both the capital and the capital-to-assets ratios, to increase the insurance premium, and in extreme cases even to remove management, and even more relevant, it is also true here, as it was in Kimbell Foods, that the principal purpose of these insurance statutes is not to raise money.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.671" offset="3889027">Kimbell Foods made that very explicit, and I would point out that what Kimbell Foods involved was two Federal insurance programs, one administered by the SBA and the other administered by the FHA, and Kimbell Foods pointed out that these are social welfare legislation statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.413" offset="3959975">Unlike tax statutes, they are not money-raising statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.126" offset="3974813">The same is true with the Federal Deposit... well, with these various acts, FIRREA and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, whose principal purposes extend to economic incentives to encourage residential lending, the development of low and moderate income housing, and lending in depressed real estate markets.</text>

            <text syncTime="981.774" offset="4077422">I mean, it seems to me if preserving the fisc is an important value, it's an important value, in whatever context.</text>

            <text syncTime="989.861" offset="4109814">The point is, Justice Scalia, that it is not its only purpose, and that in balancing the various different objectives, of which protecting the public fisc is of course one of them, the clear message that comes from Milwaukee and from Kimbell Foods and a lot of other cases that are cited in our brief dealing with this issue, the net balancing of those competing values is for the Congress of the United States, particularly where, as in City of Milwaukee... and here you have such a comprehensive statute where many defenses have been eliminated and others left intact, and particularly where, as here, you have other objectives, other than just the money raising.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.548" offset="4268534">The balancing, in short, is for Congress, and not for the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.310" offset="4283580">I return now to the other two of the Kimbell Foods factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.915" offset="4310016">The first one is whether there's a need for a uniform Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.459" offset="4332168">The Government's conduct in this very case shows that there is no such need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.118" offset="4374800">What the Government did in this particular instance was to ask for the application, and the court of appeals gave it to them, of what they perceived to be State law on the first issue, Mr. Chief Justice, which was the issue of whether there was a duty of due care that was owed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.359" offset="4451809">Then, once they turned to the imputation and the standing-in-the-shoes issues, on which State law does not favor them, then the Government changed its direction and asked for the application of Federal common law, which the Ninth Circuit gave them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.112" offset="4526728">This Court made very clear in Kimbell Foods, but even more clear in United States v. Yazell, that when the Government attempts this mix-and-match, pick-and-choose combination of Federal and State law and asks for State law to be applicable in certain instances, that that is immensely material in the language of Yazell, immensely material to the issue of whether a uniform rule really is needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.742" offset="4637278">The final of the Kimbell Foods factors concerns whether a Federal rule of decision would severely disrupt commercial relationships predicated on State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.808" offset="4689523">What we're dealing with here is two areas of State law than which there are none clearer, that are the essential and traditional centuries-long prerogative of the State courts... tort law, disciplining of lawyers, and the related one, the relationship of lawyer and client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.723" offset="4773220">Each of these represents an area in which the body of government State law has been developed over decades, and in some cases even centuries, and to now place that burden in Federal courts, displacing those bodies of governmental State concern, would not only severely disrupt commercial relationships predicated on State law, but would also be extremely burdensome on the Federal courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1184.751" offset="4889308">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.103" offset="4902787">Petitioner in this case is a law firm that was retained by a federally insured savings institution in order to prepare what are called private placement memoranda in connection with the saving institution's offering of a land development scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.057" offset="4970601">It is alleged, and for purposes of this appeal we have to assume it's true, that in the course of preparing that PPM... private placement memorandum... petitioner committed malpractice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.830" offset="5009680">Specifically, the malpractice that they committed... were alleged to have committed was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.785" offset="5029429">The private placement memorandum says in it that the bank in this case had sufficient resources to finance the land development scheme that the bank was floating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.414" offset="5076031">That was not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.003" offset="5082300">As a matter of fact, the bank was insolvent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.494" offset="5092331">The negligence that is asserted against petitioner is that they negligently failed to discover that, and put in the PPM that the bank was in fact solvent, and that assets would be there to lend to the partnership for the purposes of the land development project.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.025" offset="5154398">If petitioner had discovered, as it should have, that the bank was insolvent, it never could have put that, and never would have put that, in the PPM, and the scheme would not have gone forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.475" offset="5200269">The allegation is that because the scheme went forward, that cost the bank a substantial amount of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.967" offset="5226183">It did that because shortly after the scheme closed, Federal regulators came in, discovered that the bank was insolvent, and once the bank was insolvent, the land development project couldn't go forward because the assets of the bank were necessary for that project to go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.000" offset="5290340">So petitioner's negligence directly related to the viability of this project, and by negligently failing to discover that the bank was insolvent, petitioner hurt the bank.</text>

            <text syncTime="2657.364" offset="10779815">That's the key to understanding this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.397" offset="10787966">If this had happened while the bank was solvent, there would be a perfectly good defense, because while the bank was solvent, then the harms caused here... the $10 million, let's say, that was spent on this aborted scheme... would come out of the pockets of the shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.015" offset="10850346">Their stock would be worth less.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.078" offset="10858601">So while the bank is solvent, then this defense applies, but once the bank becomes insolvent, then the interests of the creditors are the important interests, and there was never a defense against those creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.475" offset="10904263">They never did anything wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.105" offset="10910741">It's utterly absurd to say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.158" offset="10918996">What the Ninth Circuit held was that if State law purported to say that absurdity, if State law purported to get in the way of a lawsuit that's 1) necessary to compensate the fund, and 2)... and I think this is important... necessary to make sure that professionals who act on behalf of insured savings institutions do so carefully, if State law got in the way of that and tried to erect a law that didn't protect those interests, then that's just where the theory of Kimbell Foods comes into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.103" offset="11026725">Then the State law is not adequately protecting the Federal interest, and under Kimbell Foods and under D'Cench, Duhme, under a long line of this Court's decisions, that State law is discarded, is not used because it's not adequate to protect the Federal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.614" offset="11080746">It's really important to understand here what's really going on is the need to have a system of law that adequately protects insured institutions against looting by insiders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.950" offset="11126095">That's not fanciful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.982" offset="11130274">Looting by insiders of insured institutions cause billions of dollars to the Federal fisc.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.384" offset="11147829">Sometimes, in a significant number of those cases, Congress found that the negligent conduct of third party professionals was causal in permitting those insiders to do the looting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.551" offset="11192550">It's important, it's vital under Kimbell Foods, it would frustrate the Federal interest under Kimbell Foods, if you had State law applying that didn't protect that interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2933.825" offset="11885631">But let me just cut right through, Justice Stevens, and tell you that the real answer to this is that the claims of the creditors are not involved in this case for two separate and independently sufficient reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.332" offset="11923665">The first is that under this Court's decision in Dietrich v. Standard Surety, in order for the FDIC to assert claims on behalf of creditors, those have to be alleged and proven.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.638" offset="11972880">They have been neither in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.109" offset="11982806">Moreover, under this Court's recent decision in Holmes v. Sipek, they could not be proven.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.793" offset="12001510">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.644" offset="12004958">Because in the language of that decision there is too much... the link is too remote between the O'Melveny &amp; Myers law firm and those creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.599" offset="12036723">This is not... the proximate cause defense is not just a... it's not just a defense, it is also an element of the claim, as Holmes v. Sipek makes very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.327" offset="12075593">The Ninth Circuit did not rely on the claims of creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.797" offset="12089491">The Government did not rely on the claims of creditors when it originally brought this suit, and those claims of creditors simply are not at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.364" offset="12127838">Now, coming back to the vindication of Federal interests, in addition to the specific statute, which stands unassailed, you also have this comprehensive statute, FIRREA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.461" offset="12168171">Mr. Bender says... and it's absolutely essential to his case to say this... that this is not a total package of Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.106" offset="12194712">I assert to you, it is a total package of Federal law under City of Milwaukee, and if the Court were to determine that this is not a total package of Federal law, then City of Milwaukee has got to be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.604" offset="12240792">It did, Justice Souter, establish a higher duty of obligation on behalf of officers and directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.915" offset="12265974">It also, Justice Scalia, eliminated a lot of defenses, probably dozens of defenses, but some of them it left intact, and if City of Milwaukee and Kimbell Foods mean anything at all, it is that when Congress has spoken definitively and comprehensively, picking out some to be left in place and others to be displaced, it is not the job, then, of the lawyers for the Federal Government and the Federal courts to come along behind and declare what Federal policy is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.916" offset="12377987">Now, with regard to causation, the only way that the Government can satisfy the causation responsibility in this case is to argue for a but-for House-That-Jack-Built type of causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.043" offset="12434516">Necessarily, the causation that we're talking about in this instance if California law applies, as it must, is proximate causation and not but-for causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.313" offset="12487597">I invite the Court's attention to Flagg v. Seng, which is very clear on this point, and is squarely consonant with Holmes v. Sipek.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.478" offset="12520198">That case says that unless there is justifiable reliance, which there is not if you impute the knowledge of the agent to the corporation, then there is no proximate cause, and it's not, as I say, just a defense, it is also an element of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.820" offset="12597624">With regard to Kimbell Foods, let me just point out I've heard nothing today, and really there is nothing effective in the brief, that disputes as to all three of those Kimbell Foods factors the following: 1) they are mixing and matching.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.941" offset="12654049">The argument that has been made here today that they're now asserting the claims of creditors, when they didn't even assert them in their complaint, is another classic example of mixing and matching.</text>

            <text syncTime="3185.100" offset="12890718">And with regard to that, Justice O'Connor, as to how the taxpayers and the citizens will ultimately be served, let me just turn Mr. Bender's point around and ask us to put ourselves in the position of the O'Melveny partners when the next case comes up in which they're asked to represent a savings and loan and the Ninth Circuit law still remains in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.375" offset="12983819">Probably the reaction is going to be, we don't know what law is going to apply, we don't know what has happened, we have no... absolutely no indication at this time of any wrongdoing, and we certainly didn't in this instance, let's just stay out of it altogether.</text>

            <text syncTime="3226.955" offset="13058111">Now, finally, the one thing that is clear from the briefs and from this argument is that the judgment of the Ninth Circuit must be reversed.</text>
