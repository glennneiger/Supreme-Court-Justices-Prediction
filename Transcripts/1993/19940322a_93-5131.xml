            <text syncTime="70.159" offset="446523">We come here today relying upon our record and the clear, firm, unequivocal mandate of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.811" offset="493126">If a State chooses to use aggravating factors in the penalty determination phase and they play a critical role, they're subject to vagueness analysis under the Eighth Amendment, because vague, aggravating circumstances... vague, aggravating circumstance increases the risk of arbitrary and capricious sentencing, and therefore it gives no guidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.253" offset="594899">Did California choose to use an aggravating circumstance?</text>
            <text syncTime="113.955" offset="621752">It did.</text>

            <text syncTime="134.556" offset="704090">We, the jury, find the aggravating circumstances outweigh, substantially outweigh the mitigating circumstances, and the penalty should be death.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.178" offset="738677">That was the death verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.097" offset="750275">There was one other, the opposite conclusion coming to life if the aggravating circumstances did not outweigh the mitigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.562" offset="780159">The instructions from the court... as, Justice Kennedy, you just referred to how important they are when they come from the court... told the jury to weigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, to assign a value to those factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.684" offset="824672">The argument of the prosecutor, second most important person in the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.963" offset="845779">The factors are the essence of the case, the fundamental issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="178.834" offset="881201">But, Mr. Gillingham, how could the vagueness of one of those factors produce any more random decisions than not giving the jury any factors at all and just saying having found one of the necessary conditions for imposing the death penalty, which California says is prior to the... to this stage of the case, just telling the jury once you've found guilt with one of these statutory factors that enable the imposition of the death penalty, it's up to you to propose the death penalty or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.321" offset="1023202">Surely the vagueness of one of the factors can't be any more arbitrary than that, any more random than that.</text>

            <text syncTime="242.261" offset="1135006">But what happens in California... again though not required, but California has chosen to give the jury a menu, a shopping list perhaps, a lens to evaluate the evidence through.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.710" offset="1184744">And when that lens is distorted by vagueness, it distorts the process.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="259.865" offset="1205328">But isn't there a significant difference between the use that California makes of the factors and the use that we have... the uses that we have been concerned with in past cases when we have said that in weighing States, the vagueness of the factors infects the weighing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.389" offset="1263424">And isn't... in our prior cases, wasn't our rationale that the fact that the State had identified a certain kind of propositional aggravating circumstance, like it was cruel, there was torture in the commission and so on... the fact that the State has weighed... has identified a statement like that, when found to be true as an aggravating factor, and that statement is also vague so that, in fact, it's kind of a wild card, we really never can tell whether it's really true or not, it is the use of that factor which the State has given emphasis to by its identification in the narrowing stage which is what skews the weighing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.276" offset="1459029">But here the aggravating factors that are being used at the weighing stage are not the aggravating factors which have been used at the narrowing stage.</text>

            <text syncTime="336.863" offset="1513364">And it's exactly what was argued in Stringer, Your Honor, and that is not the distinguishing point because if that were the case, basically Stringer would have overruled Zant.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.955" offset="1549726">Because in Zant, as in Stringer, there were otherwise two valid aggravating factors.</text>

            <text syncTime="351.514" offset="1571983">No, but the point in Stringer was... there was no problem at the... by the use of an aggravate... of a vague aggravator at the narrowing stage because you had a nongrave... nonvague aggravator, that's all.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.134" offset="1626422">The problem in Stringer, as I recall it, was that by using an aggravator which the State had identified as being especially important despite its vagueness, that skewed the weighing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.487" offset="1683891">Here you're not using the same aggravator to weigh that you did to narrow, and you're not using an aggravator which states a proposition like "it was cruel".</text>
            <text syncTime="391.592" offset="1732270">Instead, you're using an aggravator that simply looks to subject matter, and aren't those the two distinguishing factors between this case and Stringer?</text>

            <text syncTime="399.979" offset="1765811">They are distinguishing without a difference, Your Honor, in this... in some ways, but in other ways, to use Justice Kennedy's description in Stringer, it's worse in the penalty phase determination, it's absolutely worse.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.474" offset="1819832">It's at this time that the jury is sitting there needing the guidance, just about ready to decide life or death, and we give them not a narrow... not a narrow aggravator, as all the States have, we give them not even a singly directed aggravator such as in Maynard, the</text>
            <text syncTime="429.013" offset="1882004">"heinous, cruel, and atrocious. "</text>
            <text syncTime="430.310" offset="1887124">or the "outrageously vile", and those are vague.</text>

            <text syncTime="438.854" offset="1921292">In other words, we identify a subject matter which it is relevant for them to consider, and that is exactly the same thing that the jury in a State like Georgia, which does not go through a formal weighing process, can do.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.005" offset="1961939">Once the narrowing is done in Georgia, the jury in effect can consider everything it knows in deciding whether or not, at the penalty phase, to impose that penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.455" offset="1999764">And what California, it seems to me, is doing is to say you may consider the following subjects: age, circumstances, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.124" offset="2034455">It seems to me that if we accept your argument, then schemes like Georgia are going to be unconstitutional too, which I think is the implication of Justice Scalia's question.</text>

            <label>Ms. Wendy Cole Lascher</label>
            <text syncTime="1221.851" offset="5053269">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.408" offset="5099558">I'd like to return to the subject of the process the jury in California is directed to go through, because I think the process that is involved in these cases may answer some of Justice Souter's concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.151" offset="5158490">The jury is told that it must weigh 11 enumerated factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.994" offset="5181896">And, indeed, in Mr. Proctor's case it was told that the result of its weighing process would produce a mandatory result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.240" offset="5214915">And so the very nature of the numerating factors leads us into the constitutional difficulty that existed both in the Tuilaepa case and even more so in the Proctor case, because now you're not merely telling the jury to look at the wealth of evidence it's already heard and make a determination about that and see if anything mitigating outweighs it, which is what you would have in a Georgia scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.511" offset="5311986">But you're telling the jury to put the factor... factors... as it were, the evidence into little boxes and to look at each one separately and to give independent weight to each of those boxes, however much or little weight the jury chooses, but still to give them weight, put them on the balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.803" offset="5377083">And so the jury has to go through a tangible process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.192" offset="5390667">We know that happened in the Proctor case because the prosecutor told the jury it was going to do that, the defense lawyer told the jury it was going to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.922" offset="5425566">The judge not only instructed the jury orally to do that, but it said to the jury, here are the written instructions; you may take them into the jury room and you may read along with me as I go through these factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.183" offset="5470601">And the California Supreme Court itself, at Joint Appendix 152, said that the jury would have understood they were required to determine the penalty by weighing the enumerated factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.945" offset="5517726">And at page 1... page 77 of the record, a very interesting jury instruction, when the judge does read the factors to the jury, he says, first:</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.580" offset="5564224">"In determining which penalty is to be imposed on the defendant you shall consider all of the evidence which has been received during any part of the trial of this case. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.560" offset="5600169">And then a new... and then there's a little more in that sentence on exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.215" offset="5614797">Then he goes on to a second sentence:</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.448" offset="5623679">"You shall consider, take into account, and be guided by the following factors, if applicable. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.447" offset="5647712">So the jury is led into a formula it almost has to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.116" offset="5670386">It's not a precise mathematical formula, but it is required to go through these steps, and that's why vagueness in any factor brings this case squarely within not only Stringer, but the whole line of cases that brought us to this--</text>

            <text syncTime="1428.642" offset="5880515">In Georgia where the jury is not given any kind of direction except that it's given mitigating evidence to weigh, when the jury goes into the jury room there's a collective process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.590" offset="5920326">That's what we count on, that's why we have all this litigation about jury instructions in death penalty cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.260" offset="5943000">The jurors have to negotiate with each other, they have to look one another in the eye, they have to decide, okay, now we're really at the crunch, what are we going to do, is this murder a serious enough one to impose a death penalty and not another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.098" offset="5994304">If you give the jury a list of factors or any other kind of instructions that guide them through a process, you're, in effect, giving them a yardstick, and giving them a yardstick gives them a sense of confidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.001" offset="6037877">We sort of... the Court sort of heard about that in the mentally ill defendant this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.452" offset="6055744">But if you give them a rubber yardstick, which is what you do in California when you use factors that are of such vague content, then you're giving them a very false sense of confidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1918.148" offset="7838549">Because if you have, let's say, 20 juries evaluating identical sets of facts that involve some of the factors involved... that the prosecutor argued in our case: was the defendant intoxicated or not; did he have an accomplice or not, a factor that the California Supreme Court itself can't even agree on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.812" offset="7921201">When you have that situation of the 20 juries, you might have 10 juries whose reaction to the evidence is this is an aggravated, horrible crime, it does not outweigh mitigation, and this defendant should be put to death; and you may have 10 who conclude the defendant should not be put to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.665" offset="7992567">And it is inevitable in our constitutional scheme that juries will react differently to facts, and as long as we're going to have a death penalty and have juries making the decision, that will happen and defense lawyers will have to contend with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.254" offset="8038961">However, what happens when you outline factors, as we do in California, and you outline them in a vague way, is that you can have the same 20 juries looking at the same set of facts and coming to totally opposite conclusions, 10 one way and 10 the other, not based on the facts, not based on their reaction to the facts, but solely based on their personal interpretations of the jury instructions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2430.911" offset="9889579">But when it starts piling things up and weighing them, putting them in a balancing process, the circumstances of the crime is always going to be a factor in favor of the prosecution, because it always exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.580" offset="9932211">And if that were all it took for the jury to make the determination, the State wouldn't need to list it as a factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.452" offset="9955721">One way to solve... save the California statute would be to eliminate factor (a) and then to label the other factors as aggravating or mitigating to the... at least to the extent that's possible.</text>

            <text syncTime="3891.544" offset="15732126">Well, I think you can attempt to characterize it... it's fair to characterize that as an attempt to lessen the aggravating impact of it and to draw it more to the mitigating side of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3907.086" offset="15794298">I mean, it's... this is not a question where the... that the circumstances of the offense all... especially (a), that it all pulls in one direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.157" offset="15854588">That's just simply not true, and it's not true in either of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3926.077" offset="15870262">Now, there are always going to be circumstances of the offense, that's true, but those are the factors which this Court has consistently demanded... not just suggested but demanded be placed before the jury at the sentencing phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="3940.852" offset="15929299">So California certainly can't be faulted for allowing the jury to basically consider, take into account, and be guided by these factors at the sentencing phase.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="3958.204" offset="15998784">Perhaps this is repeating what Justice Kennedy asked, but I want to be sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3966.061" offset="16030131">Supposing in that circumstance (a), they said the circumstances of the crime, so forth and so on, including whether or not the crime was cruel, heinous, and atrocious, would that still be valid?</text>

            <label>Mr. William George Prahl</label>
            <text syncTime="3979.806" offset="16085093">Well, again, that changes the basic nature of the California statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3985.241" offset="16106931">It would be... it would not be in keeping... I don't know whether that would be... whether that would be valid or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3996.379" offset="16151444">Again, we have heinous, atrocious, and cruel within our special circumstances and we have judicially declared that to be invalid in California and it's no longer used.</text>
            <text syncTime="4007.420" offset="16195643">Now, if we were to duplicate that within the aggravating factors, California has held, as a matter of State law, that we are limited to only those sentencing factors that are mentioned in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4023.491" offset="16259904">There are no nonstatutory aggravating factors, although the defendant can argue anything in response in mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4030.958" offset="16289788">So the same limitation is not applied to the defense that's applied to the prosection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4037.377" offset="16315388">The prosecution cannot argue nonstatutory aggravating factors beyond those that are... anything that's listed in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4045.498" offset="16347885">The defense can argue anything it wants, in addition to the factors listed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4049.841" offset="16365230">Again, California has gone out of its way and has vigorously tried to meet the concerns expressed by this Court and the Eighth Amendment to avoid arbitrary and capricious findings of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="4068.380" offset="16439418">And we feel very strongly that California's statute... that the hybrid nature of it is especially geared to allowing for what this Court has called an individualized penalty determination where you look at both the nature of the offense and the nature of the offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="4087.637" offset="16516427">Again, these factors are distinguishable, clearly distinguishable from those at issue in Stringer and those earlier cases which dealt with the so-called weighing States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4099.148" offset="16562507">In that sense, California is not a weighing State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4102.319" offset="16575150">It's... the California penalty determination is much... if it's closer to any State, it's closer to Georgia in that the eligibility determination is made early on and then basically drops away and then the jury has a guided amount of discretion to look at certain relevant factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4132.462" offset="16695731">Now, the California Supreme Court in its Bacigalupo two decision, following this Court's remand of the original Bacigalupo case, addressed specifically, as this Court had asked the Mississippi Court to do in Stringer... and I believe there was an earlier certified question in Zant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4152.158" offset="16774517">The Court has specifically addressed the issues about the nature of the California statute, and has found that California is not a weighing State within the meaning of this Court... as that term is used in Stringer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4166.511" offset="16831986">The California Supreme Court went on to say, however, that there are certain limitations that do apply to the sentencing phase, that they should be relevant and specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="4178.366" offset="16879424">And the court... the California Supreme Court announced that as an Eighth Amendment test.</text>
            <text syncTime="4182.988" offset="16897919">We see that as an unwarranted expansion of this Court's Eighth Amendment jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4189.143" offset="16922474">The Eighth Amendment now has two basic tests that have been in place for a number of years: the death penalty eligibility should be narrowed, and the defendant should be able to present any mitigating evidence and the jury should be able to act on that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4204.824" offset="16985168">The relevance and specificity requirements for sentencing factors, as the California Supreme Court announced them, are much closer to this Court's Fourteenth Amendment types of questions, and I think that's what the Delaware v. Dawson basically held, that when you look at certain types of evidence that is introduced at a penalty phase, that what you're really looking at when you get right down to relevance is a question of Fourteenth Amendment notice and basic understanding, not an Eighth Amendment consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4244.682" offset="17144619">And to expand this Court's Eighth Amendment jurisprudence beyond where it has existed for years we feel is unwarranted since that is basically covered already within this Court's... or within the Fourteenth Amendment's proscription against irrelevant considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4263.691" offset="17220688">I think Delaware v. Dawson adequately addresses this question, and certainly the relevance criteria, which this Court has applied on several occasions, adequately addresses that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4274.858" offset="17265305">And although we don't basically have a problem with the semantics of the test announced in Bacigalupo two, we do have some concern over the constitutional underpinning of that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="4290.118" offset="17326432">Again, that's the California Supreme Court's determination and this Court is here to look at that and decide whether or not there is a basis for expanding the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4304.206" offset="17382752">Unless this Court has any further questions, we're prepared to submit the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4308.360" offset="17399366">We feel very strongly, again, that if the Court... with the Court's understanding of the special and unique nature of the California statute, its hybrid character, the roles of the special circumstances in California which are basically not challenged here, and the relevance and materiality of those sentencing factors, that the defendants in this case received a fair trial; that the material that the juries considered was not vague or overbroad, it was directed to the very issue before them; and we ask this Court to affirm both of the decisions by the California Supreme Court.</text>

          <turn speaker="howard_w_gillingham" startTime="4348.688" stopTime="4469.811">
            <label>Mr. Howard W. Gillingham</label>
            <text syncTime="4348.688" offset="17560698">Justice Scalia, you smiled when there was a reference to the possibility of there being a mitigator, and indeed I've seen juries almost do the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4355.982" offset="17589850">Because what happens... and we have it in Proctor's case... is that we have these factors put up there by the State of California, and it's not as counsel paints it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4363.120" offset="17618376">If he paints it... if it's that way in California, this is a barn and not a courtroom, in the sense that it is not what it appears to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="4369.180" offset="17642618">The case... the Proctor court itself said the jurors would have understood that they had to weigh these factors, aggravating and mitigating.</text>
            <text syncTime="4374.334" offset="17663202">Let's talk about what happened in the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="4376.849" offset="17673338">The jury was told they had to weigh these factors and the man stands here and says it's not a weighing State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4381.877" offset="17693400">If this Court is prepared... and I don't think it is... to turn its back on Stringer, on Maynard, my God, to say that these factors are not used.</text>
            <text syncTime="4391.795" offset="17733106">Age, he only argued age; he didn't argue it as a aggravator.</text>
            <text syncTime="4394.919" offset="17745540">He was old enough to plan and execute a robbery, he was sophisticated enough to execute a robbery, and a human being, a rifle, squeezed the trigger, hunk of lead tore through flesh.</text>
            <text syncTime="4405.258" offset="17786918">So when you think about the defendant's age, think about what he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="4410.257" offset="17806980">So even age can creep up into circumstances of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="4414.177" offset="17822654">Oh, he wasn't arguing it in aggravation, was he.</text>
            <text syncTime="4416.521" offset="17831953">Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I wonder what they would think.</text>
            <text syncTime="4418.739" offset="17840835">They would think it was aggravating, and they think it every time I've tried the case, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4422.485" offset="17855881">The California Supreme Court itself, Justice Kennedy, has identified (d), (e), (f), (g), and (h) as only being mitigating.</text>
            <text syncTime="4429.733" offset="17884825">Funny thing, Justice Scalia, they don't tell the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4433.013" offset="17897991">The jury doesn't get told.</text>
            <text syncTime="4442.588" offset="17936234">It's a facade.</text>
            <text syncTime="4438.464" offset="17919725">I'm embarrassed to say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4440.994" offset="17929860">I don't say that with hostility.</text>
            <text syncTime="4444.259" offset="17942921">The California Supreme Court says those factors, whatever one things of the judgment, can only be mitigating, but we don't tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury, and the prosecutor is able to stand up... I've been there time and time again... there's no evidence that the victim consented.</text>
            <text syncTime="4458.330" offset="17999241">He did it in Proctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4459.738" offset="18004884">Do you think Mrs. Stendal consented to being raped and stabbed?</text>
            <text syncTime="4463.422" offset="18019617">Now, ladies and gentlemen, there's no evidence of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4465.344" offset="18027245">Ladies and gentlemen, there's no evidence of mental disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="4467.717" offset="18036753">You saw what Mr. Tuilaepa did, ladies and gentlemen.</text>
