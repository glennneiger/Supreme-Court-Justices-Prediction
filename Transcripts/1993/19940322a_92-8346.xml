            <text syncTime="10.428" offset="181985">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.120" offset="192748">This case requires the Court to determine whether and under what circumstances it is appropriate for a trial court to instruct the jury that in the event of a not guilty solely by reason of insanity verdict, that the accused will be committed to a mental hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.173" offset="268921">Hereafter I will simply refer to the form of verdict as an NGI verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.569" offset="290550">The case comes about because of the passage by Congress in 1984 of the IDRA, the Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.688" offset="346975">That Act was passed in part in reaction to the unfortunate events surrounding the assassination attempt of President Reagan.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.175" offset="400892">The Congress had been considering insanity defense reform for some time before that, however, and this simply was the event that pushed the Congress to agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.595" offset="454599">Prior to the passage of that Act, the... there was no provision outside the District of Columbia for the mandatory commitment of a defendant acquitted in a Federal prosecution because of insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.186" offset="528996">In fact, there was no not guilty by insanity verdict, as such; there was simply the general verdicts guilty or not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.642" offset="562851">The IDRA changed that, and prescribed a form of verdict which is not guilty solely by reason of insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.004" offset="632232">The Congress, in adopting this law, modeled it closely on the District of Columbia Act which, of course, also was a congressional enactment.</text>

            <text syncTime="141.307" offset="705479">Mr. Trout, when you say Congress modeled it closely on the District of Columbia Act, what do you mean, that they looked to the District of Columbia Act only?</text>

            <text syncTime="157.666" offset="770890">Is there evidence is the legislative history that they did look at the District of Columbia Act?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas R. Trout</label>
            <text syncTime="162.539" offset="790430">Yes, there's quite a bit of evidence that they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.943" offset="800043">In the Senate Report, which is the most comprehensive report in the legislative history about the adoption of this Act, the... reference to the D.C. Code provisions are quite numerous and throughout the report.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.547" offset="882381">The Congress in particular paid close attention to the disposition that was to be made of the accused in the event he was found not guilty solely by reason of insanity, and most closely modeled the IDRA on the D.C. enactment with regard to that disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.594" offset="974645">I think that is why it is so relevant to the issue that we have before the Court today, because we are dealing with what happens to the accused in the event he's found not guilty solely by reason of insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.662" offset="1030861">The D.C. Circuit has already held that the IDRA was modeled on D.C. section 24-301 in the Crutchfield case.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.316" offset="1121558">The Government, in its brief, did not deal with the Crutchfield case whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.922" offset="1155935">It did not mention it, it did not try to point out any error in it, and I think it incumbent on the Government today to at least respond to the Crutchfield case and either admit that the holding in that case is correct or else explain to the court where the error in that case is.</text>

            <text syncTime="291.430" offset="1305982">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.150" offset="1312878">If there is any question about whether the IDRA was modeled on 24-301, I think it important to point out the similarities, and especially with regard to the disposition that's to be made of the accused in the event of the not guilty by reason of insanity verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.129" offset="1424787">It's true that the Congress made certain changes in the... between 24-301 and IDRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.317" offset="1477554">They increased the burden of proof from preponderance of the evidence to clear and convincing evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.431" offset="1502005">In the D.C. statute the burden had been placed on the defendant to prove the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.888" offset="1539830">They kept that burden on him; they simply increased it to clear and convincing.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.263" offset="1561251">There were other minor changes that dealt with the trial phase of a criminal case in which the insanity defense is at issue, and all of those changes generally are to increase the difficulty on the accused of successfully asserting the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.457" offset="1658113">But once the defense is successfully asserted, then the IDRA and 24-301 are very very similar.</text>

            <text syncTime="460.602" offset="1982658">I think that it's difficult to think of congressional enactments which prescribe for the court what instructions they ought to give.</text>

            <text syncTime="1691.581" offset="6906531">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.065" offset="6944461">Petitioner's principal contention in this case is that it was error for the judge not to instruct the jury on the consequences of an insanity verdict because that instruction is required by the text of the Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.887" offset="7007781">As a simple matter of statutory construction, that contention must be incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.840" offset="7031605">The Insanity Defense Reform Act does expressly deal with instruction to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.514" offset="7050309">It requires the jury to be instructed that it can find the defendant guilty, not guilty, or not guilty by reason of insanity in a case in which the insanity defense has been raised, but it is absolutely silent concerning instructions on the consequences of an insanity verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.205" offset="7117078">Now, petitioner seeks to rely on the familiar canon of statutory construction that where Congress has adopted a statute enacted in another jurisdiction and that statute has received a settled judicial interpretation, Congress must be deemed to have adopted that settled interpretation along with the text.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.966" offset="7188131">Now, there are several reasons why that canon of construction does not help petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.280" offset="7209342">First of all, the canon does not even apply here for the simple reason, as Justice Scalia and Justice Souter have pointed out, that the D.C. Circuit, in laying down the mandatory rule of instruction in Lyles, was not engaging in interpretation of the D.C. statute.</text>
