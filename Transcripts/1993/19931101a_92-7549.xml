            <text syncTime="2110.537" offset="8586610">In addition, on this record it is a requisite for the application of Price and Green that the jury has a full opportunity to convict, and in this context opportunity to convict has to mean that the jury had an opportunity to convict on all of the counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.230" offset="8657454">Because, as I believe in one of the answers to one of the questions earlier, had they convicted on the... on count I but been silent on counts II and III, then we would be here arguing over whether they had acquitted him of the felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.830" offset="8719835">And the only case that we've been able to locate that addresses this specific issue is a case from the New York Court of Appeals, People v.

            <text syncTime="2160.331" offset="8785872">The jury was told you only are supposed to return one verdict.</text>

Swenson and that line of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.985" offset="9828471">Because this Court's cases consistently teach that what double jeopardy precludes is a subsequent prosecution for an entire offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.840" offset="9867864">It simply doesn't speak to preclusion of particular elements, particular factual elements.</text>

            <text syncTime="2446.921" offset="9932230">In this sense, a pure double jeopardy claim in criminal law is analogous to a claim preclusion claim in the civil law, just as... and collateral estoppel in criminal law, of course, is analogous to collateral estoppel in civil law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.844" offset="10003910">In one instance, the whole claim is precluded, whether that is a civil or criminal claim, cause of action as it were, and in the other instance particular elements are precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.000" offset="10056468">That is important for this case for a number of reasons, because if the record in this case shows anything, it shows that the petitioner has failed to establish a jury determination on the issue of intent in his favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.351" offset="10125954">The Court's cases are very clear that this burdener... burden rests on one claiming criminal collateral estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.187" offset="10161271">All the way from Ashe v. Swenson, which adopted collateral estoppel, to Dowling v. United States, one of the Court's more recent cases on the issue, the Court has made plain that the defendant must show that there is no other possible explanation for the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.898" offset="10232115">I believe... that is a paraphrase, if you will, of Dowling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.751" offset="10247475">Here, of course, there are a number of possible other explanations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.325" offset="10269836">But in analyzing whether there was an actual determination in his favor, I think it's important to look at two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.790" offset="10295645">First, what did the State courts find on the issue?</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.603" offset="10310901">And second, are those findings fairly supported by the record? The Indiana Supreme Court's finding is clear, that the jury simply chose not to consider count I..</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.747" offset="10327515">That appears in the Joint Appendix at page 140.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.487" offset="10382476">And that's a finding that's entitled to a presumption of correctness under 28 U.S.C. section 2254(d), as long as it's fairly supported by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.083" offset="10424795">In this case, I don't think there's any question that the record fairly supports the Indiana Supreme Court's conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.348" offset="10457918">Petitioner's argument is that the jury acquitted him on the issue of intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3052.269" offset="12353572">And why this point came up in rebuttal was the defendant had, indeed, presented this defense to one of the felony murder counts, and the prosecutor said to the jury it doesn't matter because you can only return one verdict anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.908" offset="12420132">He said, give the defense counsel his argument, be that as it may, you're only allowed to return one verdict.</text>
