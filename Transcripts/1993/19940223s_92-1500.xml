            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="6.751" offset="118005">The first of the cases is Caspari against Bohlen which comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.865" offset="154472">The respondent, Christopher Bohlen, was convicted in Missouri State Court on three counts of first degree robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.646" offset="181535">He was sentenced as a persistent offender to three consecutive 15-year prison terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.556" offset="205254">Under Missouri law, a persistent offender is someone the trial judge finds beyond the reasonable doubt who have been convicted of two or more prior felonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.136" offset="247573">The Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction but reversed the sentence because no proof had been made of the prior convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.860" offset="278397">On remand, the state introduced evidence of four prior felony convictions, rejecting the respondent's contention that allowing the state another opportunity to prove his prior convictions violated the Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.247" offset="335971">The trial judge found the respondent to be a persistent offender and again, sentenced him to three consecutive 15-year terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.591" offset="369408">The Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.251" offset="379961">The respondent subsequently filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.467" offset="396889">The United States District Court denied the petition rejecting the contention that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the state from introducing evidence of his prior convictions on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.396" offset="448611">The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.614" offset="461463">It recognized that we have previously applied the Double Jeopardy Clause to bar a subsequent capital sentencing hearing and it held that applying the same double jeopardy protection to a non-capital case would not require the announcement of a new rule of constitutional law in violation of the non-retroactivity principle of Teague against Lane.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.542" offset="557176">We disagree and in an opinion filed today with the Clerk, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.735" offset="585911">On federal habeas, the court must survey the legal landscape as it existed when the conviction and sentence became final and it must determine whether a State Court considering the defendant's claim at that time would have felt compelled to conclude that the rule he seeks was required by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.458" offset="664800">In this case, we conclude that the State Court would not have felt so compelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.801" offset="686221">We have repeatedly held that the pronouncement of sentence has never carried the constitutional finality that attaches to an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.947" offset="722792">Although we have recognized an exception to that principle in Bullington against Missouri for capital cases, we have not extended that rationale to non-capital cases at the time respondent's conviction and sentence became final.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.800" offset="782247">And in deed, several of our cases pointed in the opposite direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.193" offset="799801">Moreover, the lower State and Federal Courts were divided on the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.594" offset="825401">We conclude that applying the Double Jeopardy Clause to respondent's subsequent non-capital hearing was not dictated by precedent at the time his conviction and sentence became final.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.212" offset="875870">We also hold that neither of the two narrow exceptions to the non-retroactive activity principle apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.888" offset="910560">And because of our resolution of the case on Teague grounds, we have no occasion to decide in this case whether the Double Jeopardy Clause applies to non-capital sentencing, or whether the Missouri's persistent offender scheme is sufficiently trial-like to invoke those protections, nor do we have to consider the state's contention that Bullington should be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.240" offset="1007945">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
