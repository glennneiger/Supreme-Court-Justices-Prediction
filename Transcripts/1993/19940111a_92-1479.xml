            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="150591">We'll hear argument first this morning in number 92-1479, McDermott, Inc., v. AmClyde and River Don Castings Limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.808" offset="197820">Mr. Lea.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="arden_j_lea" startTime="13.370" stopTime="241.263">
            <label>Mr. Arden J. Lea</label>
            <text syncTime="13.370" offset="203985">Mr. Chief Justice, Justices of this honorable Court, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="19.365" offset="228018">Petitioner McDermott, Incorporated, is here today to obtain relief from the double penalty placed upon it by the Fifth Circuit, which left in place a trial judge's reduction of its judgment, pursuant to the proportionate fault rule; which, at the same time, it rejected and, then, from that reduced amount, compounded injustice by further deducting from the judgment the full dollar amount of a settlement with another codefendant... to the detriment, obviously, of the injured plaintiff, McDermott.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.777" offset="369602">Encapsulated in these facts, which, on their own, would require reversal, is a disputed issue of admiralty law requiring resolution by this Court... namely, which rule on settlement contribution should be adopted by the Court: the proportionate fault rule or the pro tanto rule?</text>
            <text syncTime="78.232" offset="463433">Interestingly, all parties agree that three fundamental principles surrounding the resolution of this issue... which are, initially, all agree that the principle of joint and several liability is, and should continue to be, the rule of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.810" offset="561758">All agree that liability among co-tort phases is and should continue to be determined proportionately at trial and, also, in any contribution action.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.416" offset="608152">All agree that settlement should be encouraged, but not at the expense of the two preceding principles; nor at the expense of needlessly altering the rights of the parties to the remain... of the non-settling defendant in the proceeding at trial that will later follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.359" offset="679936">The disputed issue before the Court is whether the adoption of the proportionate or the dollar-for-dollar settlement... so-called tanto... pro-tanto contribution rule... will best effectuate these fundamental principles mentioned above, and which should be incorporated by this Court into admiralty law.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.061" offset="762797">The Court today has to accommodate its historical favoring of settlement of claims entered into by the injured plaintiff, and the need to protect the rights of the non-settling defendant, who is not a party to the settlement agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.706" offset="841373">McDermott urges this Court to hold that the proportionate settlement contribution rule is the faires and, thus, the best.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.472" offset="876377">The plaintiff is permitted, under this rule, to become... to remain a master of its own destiny with regard to its claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.968" offset="914411">He can choose, with consultation of counsel, which method best serves the resolution of the claim that is his anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.557" offset="956730">He, by settling, accepts both the benefits and the detriment of the contract, as is the case with respect to any contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.482" offset="996436">On the other hand, most importantly, the non-settle... settling defendant's contribution rights remain unaltered because, at trial, they will be decided proportionately.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.432" offset="1056309">Now, there are certain alleged perceived benefits to the adoption of the pro tanto rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.078" offset="1094865">But McDermott suggests to this Court that in all--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="241.263" stopTime="248.767">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="241.263" offset="1115554">Mr. Lea, you... you refer to the... the rule your espousing, I believe, you're referring to as the proportionate fault rule?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="arden_j_lea" startTime="248.767" stopTime="447.512">
            <label>Mr. Arden J. Lea</label>
            <text syncTime="248.767" offset="1145647">--Proportionate fault rule, yes, sir, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.278" offset="1155678">Which was basically the rule of comparative fault that was outlined by this Court by its adoption of that in non-collision cases in reliance transfer, and which has been the rule of this case with regard to personal injury since the country has existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.883" offset="1242091">The alleged benefits of the pro tanto, or the dollar-for-dollar credit, usually advanced to justify its adoption, can... are usually couched in terms of: It ensures full compensation to the plaintiff; it's easy to apply; the dollar-for-dollar credit satisfies the one satisfaction rule; and that it avoids potentially confusing or unnatural realignments of the parties at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.942" offset="1406349">McDermott contends that these benefits are merely perceived and, when examined carefully, do not result in the benefits advocated by proponents of the pro tanto rule: initially, full compensation to the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.683" offset="1481269">If you really think about that, that presupposes liability on the non-settling defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.597" offset="1504883">Otherwise, there would be no full compensation to the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.882" offset="1530065">It also wrongfully equates, as the Leger opinion pointed out, settlement dollars were judgment dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.358" offset="1567995">And the way they are determined... or the amount is determined that is fair... are subject to completely different rules... one are personal concerns of the parties to the settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.846" offset="1613971">Things like, in a corporation, not tying up key employees by the time necessarily consumed in defending any... or prosecuting any trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.494" offset="1656498">Another thing that would be considered would be litigation expenses, which, as everyone is quite aware, are costly these days.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.451" offset="1696309">The judgment dollars are merely what the trier of fact, be it a judge or a jury, think, after a hearing of the evidence, the case is worth... no more, no less.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.154" offset="1779169">This Court has favored, in recent years, the settlement of cases without resort to extra judicial means... with its favoring of the arbitration proceedings, for instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.414" offset="1832145">We see no reason why private, out-of-court settlements that do not affect the rights of anyone other than the parties to the agreement, as occurs in the proportionate method that we advocate, should really be of concern to the Court, other than to encourage the fact that they be entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.499" offset="1928485">There's no--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="447.512" offset="1940606">But what... what about, counsel, the unseemliness of, if you go with the proportionate fault way, the settling defendant determining that defendant's portion of the liability when that... that person is a nonparty to the litigation.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Arden J. Lea</label>
            <text syncTime="466.444" offset="2016361">--Your Honor, that's precisely what does not happen in the proportionate method, because, in the proportionate method that we're advocating, what happens is that the jury, in the trial of the non-settling defendant, is charged to render a verdict relating only to the percentage of fault that the defendant decides... who decides to go to trial contributed to the ultimate--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="493.042" offset="2122731">But would... wouldn't necessarily the jury have to determine if it's proportioning the fault, what is the respective fault of the settling defendant and the non-settling defendant?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="arden_j_lea" startTime="504.520" stopTime="549.412">

            <text syncTime="505.981" offset="2174454">It would, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.052" offset="2178738">And there is nothing really wrong with that, though, because if you really think about it, the... if... if you looked at it in... in the practical matter of how a case is tried, really, all the books written on it, there are only... almost all defendants... and I'm usually one myself... come with the same thing: first, they say the accident didn't happen or the damages weren't incurred by the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.629" offset="2277063">But, if it did, it was the fault of a... fault of a third party, either a party before the court, one that can't... the court can't exercise jurisdiction over, or the fault of the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.597" offset="2316978">And then, if it loses there, it will usually back it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.569" offset="2328785">But if... but if you find it's my fault, I only caused a little bit.</text>

            <text syncTime="947.140" offset="3939078">And, as a corollary to this, we see no reason to have one rule at trial and another rule at settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.162" offset="3959140">You are taking his constitutional right... or his right to have a full trial on his right of contribution by... against another defendant, and you are letting parties, by private agreement, to which he is not a part, set those rights, with either no right of contribution or, under the so-called fairness hearing... which we think is a misnomer, because there is nothing fair about substituting a hearing against a nonparticipating defendant for his right to trial... which is oftentimes to be held before a jury, as was in this case... and have it determined by private agreement and foisted on him in the name of fairness... because this really is not fair to anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.441" offset="4136354">The Court's review in these so-called fairness hearing are much akin to the review you would give if you were buying a 200... $200 used car... you kick the tires and you take off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.919" offset="4178255">Or, as the California court said, you make sure that the settlement is in the ball park.</text>

            <text syncTime="1117.653" offset="4621187">The commentators view it... view there... there as being three different options: a pro tanto, a pro rata and a proportional reduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.898" offset="4662147">The pure pro rata approach, which allocates the settlement based on simply the number of people in the lawsuit, is not favored by anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.424" offset="4696211">So our brief probably should have used the term proportional reduction instead.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.267" offset="4711571">But, in any event, the substance in the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.440" offset="4720348">And the substance of that rule is... is one that leaves the burdens of a party's decision to settle or not to settle a case on that party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.495" offset="4752531">We think it's, therefore, fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.546" offset="4760681">It's also efficient because it obviates the need for any collateral litigation, whether in the form of contribution or a fairness hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.180" offset="4791296">Now, the primary objection to the proportional reduction rule made by respondents in the Court of Appeals, and Justice Scalia this morning, is that it threatens to violate the so-called one recovery rule: a tort plaintiff is entitled only to recover the amount of damages determined by the jury, and no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.740" offset="4853468">And the pro tanto rule does assure that that will be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.614" offset="4864962">But we think that objection is without any merit for the following reasons:</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.276" offset="4883665">First, it wrongfully equates settlement dollars with judgment dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.659" offset="4901220">It's quite clear as an economic matter, it seems to us, that a plaintiff and a defendant, when considering whether to settle, will consider a variety of factors, not necessarily exclusively the value of the claim if it goes to trial, in determining whether to settle, and the appropriate amount at which to settle.</text>

            <text syncTime="1222.092" offset="5038937">The point is that, for example, in this case, the sling defendants made a $1 million settlement, which turns out, in retrospect, to appear to have been a bad bargain for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.048" offset="5074777">But we don't know, prior to trial, whether that was so, because they could have considered a variety of factors, in addition to the value of the claim if it goes to trial, in deciding what amount to pay, including the cost of litigating and the... the... not only the economic costs, in terms of legal fees, et cetera, but also the distraction to the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.581" offset="5148860">So it might well have been very worthwhile for them to pay more than they might have lost at judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1280.880" offset="5274039">We think that argument is... is incorrect, Justice Ginsburg, because what it does is it requires the plaintiff to transfer the benefit of his good settlement bargain to the non-settling defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.209" offset="5319388">And that results in nothing but a windfall to that defendant... as happened in this case under the Court of Appeals' opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.491" offset="5340495">The plaintiff has not achieved a double recovery in this case, because the settlement that he received was not part of the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.407" offset="5368184">It is true that the jury... the jury's determination of damages turned out to make it appear that way, but prior to the... prior to trial, the plaintiff took a risk that the settlement would be a bad deal for the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.594" offset="5412906">And we don't see any basis for undoing that bargain.</text>

            <text syncTime="1358.441" offset="5584269">In part, it surely did represent his injury, but it also represented additional economic considerations made by both the plaintiff and the defendant who settled with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.326" offset="5619796">And it seems to us that the rule you're suggesting... it's not only unfair to the plaintiff, but it's inefficient in terms of the way the tort system should operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.282" offset="5655636">Because what it does is it rewards a defendant for not settling.</text>

            <text syncTime="1429.820" offset="5869840">There's no... there should be no disincentive to settle under the proportional reduction rule that we're considering, because a defendant knows that he will only be held at trial if he fails to settle for his proportionate share of the damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="1442.869" offset="5921980">And to the extent that the settlement allocation rule deviates from that principle and coerces a defendant to settle, we think that is an illegitimate coercion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1646.677" offset="6737210">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.929" offset="6758212">The goal in any damage claim in admiralty should be compensation, not reward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.695" offset="6785275">We agree with the petitioners that there are three fundamental principles that this Court and the law keeps in mind:</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.291" offset="6819652">First, the promotion of full recovery by an injured plaintiff should be, and has been, consistently followed through.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.937" offset="6858313">Secondly, the encouragement of settlements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.438" offset="6868240">And, third, the equitable sharing of losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.238" offset="6875450">Let me state at the outset that any system adopted hard and fast, whether it's pro tanto, pro rata or proportional, carries with it some problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.948" offset="6926336">And so that, while in this case... this case was tried as a pro tanto case... and the record, I believe, reflects that... that is, when the settlement was made on the morning of trial, and... and the settlement was announced that the sling defendants had paid a million dollars in settlement, we announced that we would take the Hernandez credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.292" offset="7019750">And I am going to ultimately suggest that this Court has within its power the ability now to set a rule that will give guidance to all parties and meet the discussion and the... and the questions and the concerns that have been raised this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.584" offset="7084847">The problems, obviously, don't exist if the case goes to trial against several multiple defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.899" offset="7110134">Defendant A is found 30 percent at fault; defendant B is 70 percent at fault; there's a million dollars worth of damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.063" offset="7138764">If defendant B can only pay half of that amount, this Court would still find... I believe the law recognizes... that defendant A would have to come up with the rest, regardless of its proportionate fault finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.451" offset="7196338">And I would suggest that if we go off on a proportionate fault basis today, that we may place that in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.876" offset="7230088">On the other hand, if the case goes to trial against only one of those two defendants, it is a fiction to suggest that on the morning of trial, when a settlement is announced among one of the defendants and the plaintiff, that the jury is going to hear all of the evidence in an appropriate manner to make a reasonable decision as to the real fault in the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3276.275" offset="13255597">--If, for example, under the pro tanto regime, the dollar-for-dollar regime, the... the court of the law's principle purpose of allowing full recovery is satisfied... because if there is an insolvent defendant, just as one can do, you... you would go against the other defendant that would not... that would have a contribution right, but without real remedy, but the plaintiff could receive his full recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.424" offset="13372207">Under the system of choosing among the parties, and after the plaintiff and a settling defendant choose... it would allow the non-settling defendant to choose... that non-settling defendant would be aware of the economic circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.235" offset="13435528">And... and let me suggest if, for example, the... the defendant who was settling had relatively few funds, was, in effect, going to either go out of business or had gone out of business, or the litigation was driving them out of business and they wanted to put up some dollars... before they did that, the plaintiff would look at it and say, what is this going to do, and, what is this going to create with the non-settling defendant?</text>

            <text syncTime="3351.387" offset="13556109">May it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.690" offset="13569275">I would like to address the question that I see... that seems to be of interest... most interest to the Court, and that is, is the plaintiff purportedly getting a windfall?</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.964" offset="13606369">First, I would like to point out that in this case, we did not get a windfall, because the sling defendants had exposure in $4.5 million worth of damages that were dismissed in exchange for their million-dollar settlement, as well as this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.762" offset="13649628">We could have pursued with no East River bar the claim against them for the damage to the Shearleg crane.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.108" offset="13670944">Next of all, I want to suggest to the Court that there are oftentimes, because we love the law, because we are in it every day, tend to view the law as we would view a child, but we have to realize that the law, no more than our children, are perfect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.285" offset="13715665">And to say that a plaintiff gets a windfall presupposes that the true value or worth of a case is that set by the judicial system, the trier of fact, be it judge or jury, and that the private parties to the agreement, are... who are intimately familiar with its detail, are incapable of placing an accurate or a judicially approved value on the case.</text>
