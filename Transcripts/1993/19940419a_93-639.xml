            <text syncTime="15.942" offset="207341">This case presents an important commercial speech issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.006" offset="223537">Specifically, whether the Board of Accounting censure of Petitioner's truthful communications in attorney advertising violate her First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.529" offset="261675">The truthful speech in question consists of the CPA and the CFP credentials, which communicate licensure status.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.056" offset="299814">Petitioner is indeed a CPA, licensed in good standing by the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.290" offset="324683">Petitioner is indeed a CFP licensee in good standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.493" offset="345476">The Board has acknowledged and agreed in accepting these findings of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.717" offset="362404">The Board says, no, that these truthful communications are somehow not... are somehow misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.941" offset="403364">In doing so, it charges Petitioner with a deceptive advertising statute and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.016" offset="427605">It does so by using a contrived rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.990" offset="443488">It uses a complex hypothetical, an irrelevant argument, that attempts to transform what is truthful speech into violative conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.676" offset="486224">The record is devoid of anyone having been misled.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.821" offset="506809">The record is absolutely devoid of any violative conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.703" offset="522378">The record does disclose that no one has been misled as to Petitioner's truthful speech contained within her attorney advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.648" offset="558113">Thus, the Board is punishing Petitioner for truthful speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.382" offset="577130">There are no charges as to conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.083" offset="587893">And the BOA's, the Board of Accounting's, censure of Petitioner's truthful speech provides no latitude.</text>
