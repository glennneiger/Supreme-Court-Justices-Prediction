            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="8.263" offset="124019">This case comes to us from the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.798" offset="142096">A federal statute which we know as Title 26 U.S.C. Section 2057 adapted in October of 1986 granted an estate tax deduction for half the proceeds of a sale of employer securities by the executor of the will of a decedent to an employee stock ownership plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.831" offset="242301">Respondent Carlton, as executpr, purchased shares, sold them to the company, and its plan had a loss and claimed a substantial deduction on the estate tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.213" offset="299771">The year later however, the statute was amended to provide that in order to qualify for the deduction, his securities sold must have been directly owned by the decedent immediately before death.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.912" offset="350553">The amendment applied retroactively as if it were incorporated in the original 1986 provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.644" offset="377511">The Internal Revenue Service disallowed the deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.854" offset="390363">The District Court entered summary judgment in the ensuing refund action rejecting the executor's contention of the retroactive application violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.194" offset="443758">The Court of Appeals, by a divided vote, reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.616" offset="457446">It held that retroactive application here was harsh and oppressive, and therefore unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.406" offset="488584">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse that judgment and hold that the retroactive application did not violate due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.969" offset="522856">To be sure a tax statute's retroactive application must be supported by a legitimate legislative purpose furthered by rational means.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.503" offset="568936">But here, the amendment was neither illegitimate nor arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.826" offset="590252">Congress intended the amendment to correct what it reasonably viewed as a mistake in the original statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.547" offset="617106">The retroactive application is rationally related to the legitimate purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.776" offset="642079">Congress acted promptly and the retroactivity period extended only slightly longer than one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.657" offset="669560">Justice O'Connor has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, and Justice Scalia also has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment and is joined by Justice Thomas.</text>
