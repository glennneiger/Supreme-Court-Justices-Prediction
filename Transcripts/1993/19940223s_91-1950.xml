            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="9.472" offset="129631">This case is here on certiorari from the Supreme Court of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.277" offset="148857">The respondent, William Robert Miller, was injured while working as a seaman board a tug operating on the Delaware River and owned by the petitioner, American Dredging Company, a Pennsylvania Corporation with its principal place of business in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.074" offset="216044">After returning home to Mississippi, Miller brought this action for damages under what is called the savings to suitors clause of the United States Code, 28 U.S.C. Section 1333(1), and under the Jones Act which is 46 U.S.C. App. Section 688.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.014" offset="291799">He brought that suit in the Civil District Court, the State District Court, for Orleans, Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.310" offset="328998">That court, however, granted American Dredging's motion to dismiss based on the doctrine of forum non conveniens under which a court may decline to exercise jurisdiction if a more appropriate forum exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.290" offset="384900">The District Court concluded that federal maritime law which governs the merits of Miller's claim required application of forum non conveniens not withstanding the fact that the Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure purports to render that doctrine unavailable in maritime cases brought in Louisiana State Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.054" offset="463999">The Supreme Court of Louisiana reversed holding that Louisiana's statutory prohibition of forum non conveniens is not preempted by federal maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.264" offset="504854">We granted certiorari and now affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.714" offset="518647">In admiralty cases filed in a State Court, federal law does not preempt state law regarding the doctrine of forum non conveniens.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.905" offset="547382">We have long held that State Court's hearing admiralty cases may adapt such remedies as they see fit so long as those remedies do not materially prejudice what we have called characteristic features or interfere with the proper uniformity of admiralty law.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.228" offset="612688">Because forum non conveniens did not originate in admiralty and is a doctrine of general application not limited to admiralty, we think it not a characteristic feature of admiralty law.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.481" offset="657723">Moreover, application of forum non conveniens is not necessary to assure proper uniformity of admiralty law for two reasons: First, it is really a supervening venue rule procedural in nature rather than a substantive rule upon which maritime actors rely in making decisions about how to manage their business affairs; and secondly, it is unlikely to produce uniformed results anyway because the doctrine vests enormous discretion in the Trial Court and encompasses multifarious factors in its application.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.937" offset="787499">Our conclusion is confirmed by prior decisions under the Jones Act and the Federal Employers Liability Act which imply that federal venue rules including forum non conveniens are matters of judicial housekeeping prescribed only for the Federal Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.450" offset="849566">Justice Souter has filed a concurring opinion; Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment; Justice Kennedy has filed a dissenting opinion which is joined by Justice Thomas.</text>
