            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="5.242" offset="112208">The two opinions that I have to announce are both unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.095" offset="131643">The first, City of Ladue against Margaret Gilleo, comes to us from the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.571" offset="161527">The case involves the constitutionality of a city ordinance that prohibits home owners from displaying any signs on their property except resident's identification signs or sale signs, and signs warning of safety hazard.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.757" offset="222236">Respondent, the owner of a single family dwelling in Ladue which is a suburb of St. Louis, put an 8.5x11 inch sign in the second story window of her home stating that she was "For Peace in the Gulf".</text>
            <text syncTime="46.793" offset="278451">Because that sign violated the City's ordinance, she had brought an action in the Federal Court seeking to enjoin its enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.190" offset="304051">The District Court held the ordinance invalid as a content-based regulation because the City treated commercial speech more favorably than non-commercial speech and favored some kinds of non-commercial speech over others.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.604" offset="373641">Thus, for example, if permitted a "for sale" sign while it prohibited respondent sign with a political message.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.857" offset="398719">The Court of Appeals affirmed and we granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.638" offset="413766">An ordinance of this kind is subject to constitutional attack on alternative grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.046" offset="435395">On the one hand, it may in effect, restrict too little speech because its exemptions discriminate on the basis on the sign's messages.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.655" offset="469877">Alternatively, the ordinance may be subject to attack on the ground that it simply prohibits too much speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.777" offset="494327">The District Court and the Court of Appeals relied on the former ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.505" offset="509269">But, for reasons stated in the opinion filed with the Clerk today, we place our decision on the latter ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.947" offset="535078">We, therefore, affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals although on different reasoning than that court adapted.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.167" offset="559947">Justice O'Connor has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
