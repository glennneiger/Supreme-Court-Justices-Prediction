            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="91686">In 92-1550, ABF Freight Systems versus NLRB, the National Labor Relations Board found that petitioner had committed an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.453" offset="145498">As a remedy for the wade violation, the Board ordered the petitioner, who is an employer, to reinstate one of its former employees with backpay.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.406" offset="185309">The administrative law judge had found that the employee had given certain false testimony on an issue that turned out to be not material to the Board's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.140" offset="224179">The ourt of Appeals enforced the Board's order and we granted certiorari to consider whether the employee's false testimony should have precluded the Board from granting him relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.624" offset="270155">For reasons stated in an opinion of the Court uttered by Justice Stevens, we hold that the Board acted within the discretion granted to it by the statute, and therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.530" offset="317802">Justice Kennedy has filed a concurring opinion; Justice Scalia has filed a separate opinion concurring in the judgment in which he is joined by Justice O'Connor.</text>
