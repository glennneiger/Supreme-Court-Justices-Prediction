            <text syncTime="1291.650" offset="5312937">In fact, this system is worse than that, in that it not only gives the money raised on in-state milk to in-state farmers, but it takes the money from out-of-state farmers and transfers that money, as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.507" offset="5364450">The practical effect is that, on any given day, an out-of-state farmer's milk truck who pulls up at my client's place of business will receive, for example, $12 for his milk, while an in-state farmer, pulling up to my client's plant with the same amount of milk, which goes to the same use and goes to the same buyer, will receive $15 for that milk.</text>

            <text syncTime="1346.315" offset="5531634">First, as in Baldwin, if the higher price only applied to in-state milk, which is constitutional under Nebbia, we would prefer the out-of-state milk, because that out-of-state milk would not be subject to the lower prices... to the higher prices and, therefore, it would be cheaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.146" offset="5594955">That is to say, if the pricing order only applied to Massachusetts-produced milk, then the higher price would only be applicable to that milk, and we would buy more out-of-state milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.893" offset="5633930">But, beyond that, according to the Commissioner, under the current situation, in-state farmers are losing sales to out-of-state farmers because out-of-state farmers have cheaper costs and, therefore, can make a go of it at the current market prices, while in-state farmers cannot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.974" offset="5702266">Their ability to displace... the out-of-state farmers' ability to displace the less efficient in-state farmers is lost, because the in-state farmers are receiving the extra money to prop up their inefficient operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.041" offset="5758586">Indeed, the amount of the subsidy is explicitly tied to the Commissioner's determination as to how much Massachusetts farmers needed to cover their cost of operation, explicitly recognizing that the market price was lower than that because out-of-state farmers had lower costs and could sell milk at the lower market price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.235" offset="5839357">So, that competition has been wholly displaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.447" offset="5852209">That is to say, as this Court held in Baldwin, one of the key incidents of competition, interstate, is that citizens of one State, who have lower cost, are entitled to displace sales by citizens of another State who have higher costs, because they can sell at a lower price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.309" offset="5923575">Massachusetts is explicitly attempting to block that from occurring.</text>

            <text syncTime="1496.602" offset="6132764">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.975" offset="6142272">The main issue here is whether this Massachusetts law is, per se, illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.009" offset="6162439">We submit that the way this law operates in this particular market shows two things, both of which rebut that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.924" offset="6190129">The first is that this order is nothing more than a combination of two elements that ordinarily are lawful under the dormant Commerce Clause; and, second, we have not found a way to avoid the political process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.761" offset="6237463">We have not avoid a way... found a way to avoid accountability and responsibility to the citizens of the Commonwealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.964" offset="6258256">On that latter point, it is significant that West Lynn testified that it in fact passes on 50 percent of its assessment to its customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.520" offset="6300470">West Lynn absorbs 50 percent of the... of the assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.013" offset="6322413">And so, there are two constituencies, both dealers and either retailers or consumers, who are well represented in Massachusetts, who have every incentive, if they disagree with this disposition of money, to complain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.273" offset="6375494">The record shows that they accept this program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.906" offset="6390018">And that is why we have this law, not because we've found a way to insulate ourselves from the political process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.900" offset="6413946">Now, the context is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.373" offset="6427843">And we submit that instead of bolstering the Petitioners' argument here, the Federal context actually supports our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.431" offset="6460130">This is a highly regulated market, and the regulation extends to regulation of price... prices charged by farmers and paid by dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.248" offset="6499419">The farmer, therefore, cannot significantly reduce its price in order to effectively pass through this subsidy to the processor.</text>

            <text syncTime="2060.525" offset="8388490">But there is a substantive difference, particularly within this industry, where there is even... although this may or may not be constitutionally relevant... there is even a... a bar or... or a severe limit upon passing back this subsidy from the farmer to the processor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.056" offset="8454632">Now, the reason I say that may be of no constitutional significance is because West Lynn, in its reply brief, at page 13, note 10, says that what the farmers do with the money is of no significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.811" offset="8497681">I... I think that's a question that the Court doesn't have to reach here, because we have an industry where the farmers can't reduce their price below the Federal minimum, where the farmers are required to pay off their debt and to invest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.252" offset="8551389">And the record shows that they are very far behind in those areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.025" offset="8566436">And, in addition, the order itself is crafted with some limits to make sure that this does not get, if you will, out of hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.451" offset="8600186">It has a... a limit upon the subsidy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.063" offset="8614606">If the Zone 21 blend price gets to $15, the assessment and the subsidy vanish.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.947" offset="8638220">So there's a protection at that level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.866" offset="8649819">And, in addition, there is a limit upon the amount of the subsidy that can be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.922" offset="8670090">It's a 200,00 pound limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.672" offset="8685032">And if the farmer produces more than the 200,000, the farmer will get no subsidy for the excess amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.827" offset="8709691">So, we have... it is a substantive, as well as formal, distinction in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.641" offset="8736963">I would not advocate that we could assess our in-state processors... I'm sorry... assess all processors and merely give the money back to in-state processors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.988" offset="8782312">I think that is a discriminatory tax by another name and it ought to be treated as a discriminatory tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.993" offset="8802374">Now, the case has been argued on... on the basis that Baldwin applies here, and that, therefore, the law is, per se, invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.768" offset="8841453">The distinctions between this case and Baldwin are many, and they are fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.383" offset="8859948">Under this law, to the extent allowable by the Federal law, a out-of-state farmer may increase or decrease his or her price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.040" offset="8898504">They may import as much... or export as much milk as they wish.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.143" offset="8918984">There is simply no barrier at the border that prevents an out-of-state farmer from competing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.959" offset="8942181">And, indeed, no in-state consumer or dealer has an incentive to buy Massachusetts milk as a result of this order, nor does any incentive to buy out-of-state milk vanish as a result of this order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.455" offset="8992232">And in this resp... these respects, this case is entirely different from Baldwin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.309" offset="9011667">Baldwin involved an import ban, which is not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.870" offset="9025877">And it involved a condition which, as I think Justice Kennedy pointed out earlier, a condition which injected New York's laws into its neighboring States, to regulate the prices that were being charged there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.339" offset="9075719">To the extent that West Lynn argues that this is price regulation and relies upon the use of that word, I submit that the Supreme Judicial Court considered that issue and said, at page 126 of the joint appendix, that the pricing order does not establish a minimum price milk dealers must pay for milk, regardless of point of origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.444" offset="9168192">And to the extent that characterization at the State level by State officials is at all relevant here, that characterization should control over the characterization in the Commissioner's order, which, incidentally, was enacted before the legislature passed a statute placing this funds... these funds within the treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.830" offset="9249695">And once the legislature did that, and appropriated these funds out on a continuing basis, that was a modification of the order to that extent, and certainly removes the analogy to a price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.615" offset="9300895">The trust fund methodology that we have adopted here is a fairly standard way for States, and even the Federal Government, to structure spending.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.422" offset="9340078">And it is necessary for both State and Federal Government to have the kind of flexibility to structure the laws in these ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.169" offset="9371112">The best analogy that I can think of in this area is the Court's recent decision, 1992, in New York v. United States, particularly Part 3A of that opinion, which was a unanimous holding of the Court, where the Court viewed... or analyzed a Federal escrow scheme that was quite similar to the structure of what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.289" offset="9447494">There, money went into an escrow scheme through... through Federal taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.725" offset="9473303">It was specifically, by statute, not deemed to be property of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.958" offset="9494201">And yet, when it was disbursed from this escrow fund, the Court said that this was an exercise of spending power by Congress, and said that the funds were Federal funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.295" offset="9539549">What we are saying here is something quite similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.337" offset="9551775">We are saying that we are using a... a trust fund, or analogous to the escrow fund, and that the funds, even though they are held in... in some kind of trust, nevertheless, are spending, when they are disbursed, and, therefore, fall within the market participation doctrine, and, similarly, the funds continue to be States even though they are held in a trust fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.480" offset="9636307">The use of a trust fund presents no issue under the dormant Commerce Clause, because the dormant Commerce Clause is concerned with free trade, not with how the States structure the powers within their internal governmental organs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.620" offset="9692836">And the Highland Dairy case is... is pertinent here, because it said that how power is distributed by a State among its governmental organs is commonly, if not always, a question for the State itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.879" offset="9749887">By insisting that a subsidy come out of the general fund, West Lynn is asking the Court to evaluate the efficacy of particular State mechanisms, such as annual appropriations versus general laws versus delegation of power to an executive agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.462" offset="9832225">It's asking the Court to analyze the purposes for which revenues are raised and spent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.376" offset="9855840">And, indeed, I think counsel's response to Justice Scalia's questions in this regard suggest just how deep that inquiry goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.012" offset="9886455">Apparently, West Lynn would argue that even if money is paid into the general fund, the Court can still link that money with a subsequent subsidy and declare it invalid.</text>

            <text syncTime="2730.636" offset="11068966">Now, West Lynn has also arguing in its brief that out-of-state farmers are going to receive less from dealers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2744.606" offset="11124764">This argument is rebutted by the testimony of West Lynn's own President.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.071" offset="11146707">At page 59 of the joint appendix, he is talking about how he is going to provide for the assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.537" offset="11180561">And he says, we're putting in escrow 100 percent of the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.659" offset="11197071">So, 50 percent of the money is money we've received from customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.181" offset="11211072">The other 50 percent is money we're receiving that we're putting in right out of our own profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.115" offset="11234896">So, he's passing on 50 percent and he's taking 50 percent out of his profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.487" offset="11248375">There's nothing left for him to argue that he's paying less to out-of-state farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.119" offset="11266870">And, in fact, West Lynn did not make such a direct argument below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.533" offset="11284529">It based its argument upon an assumption of increased production in Massachusetts, which was speculative, given the limited duration of this order, given the cap and, also, the time and investment it would take to... to increase a herd.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.594" offset="11344715">And, in addition, we believe this argument was waived in Supreme Judicial Court for the reasons stated in our brief at 38, note 35.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.700" offset="11381182">In short, this statute is not a tariff, because a tariff is something that always affects the cost to the buyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.898" offset="11429979">It always creates a preference for in-state goods over out-of-state goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.110" offset="11442831">This law does not have that effect, nor does it have the other effect of a tariff, which is to raise revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.302" offset="11467595">This... this law is... to the extent that we have a fund that's limited to a particular purpose, is actually, to that extent, a harder sell in the political process, because with a tariff, the proponents of the tariff can say, well, we have to raise money anyway, let's raise it in a way that gives us ourselves an advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.326" offset="11543663">That can't be said about this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.277" offset="11551500">This law does not defray general costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.098" offset="11562785">And so, to that extent, is less attractive than a tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.742" offset="11581384">In sum, West Lynn wants this Court to adopt a new, per se, rule of illegality, even though the record shows that our law is not a protectionist regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.057" offset="11622658">There's no question that Massachusetts dairy farms are in crisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.671" offset="11637077">Our response to that crisis does not unlawfully affect interstate commerce any more than an ordinary subsidy and an evenhanded tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="2901.479" offset="11752330">This Court concluded in the Baldwin case that a State could not place itself in a position of economic isolation, quoting from page 527.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.348" offset="11795797">That is precisely what Massachusetts is seeking to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.500" offset="11808336">Today, Massachusetts farmers are less efficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.982" offset="11818367">They cannot sell at the market price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.313" offset="11827667">And they are losing sales as a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.293" offset="11835608">The pricing order has come into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.596" offset="11844803">It requires we, the processors, to pay more money to the Massachusetts farmers in order that they have enough money in their pockets to meet their costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.132" offset="11878867">The necessary result is that out-of-state farmers cannot displace in-state farmers as the Interstate Commerce Clause guarantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.885" offset="11909900">Justice Scalia is precisely right, it makes no difference whether the effect of this is to preserve sales that would otherwise be lost, or increase sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.401" offset="11943964">In either effect, the purposes of the Interstate Commerce Clause are being thwarted because interstate competition is being thwarted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.846" offset="11977819">The technique being used here is somewhat different than in Baldwin, but the effect is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.530" offset="12000493">In Baldwin, the State required a higher price for its farmers in order to keep cheaper milk from coming in from out of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.796" offset="12029541">They also required that higher price to be paid to out-of-state farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.499" offset="12044379">That was deemed unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.959" offset="12050230">Here, the State is requiring a higher price to be paid to Massachusetts farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.432" offset="12068098">And in order to prevent us from buying cheaper milk, not subject to that requirement, from out-of-state farmers, we are required to pay the same premium... that is to say, the same difference between the market price and the state-mandated price on that out-of-state milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.591" offset="12124731">The difference is we are being required to pay that money over to the in-state farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.083" offset="12142703">To the extent that that is a difference with Baldwin, it's a difference that makes the system worse, because in-state... out-of-state farmers receive no benefit whatsoever from this scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.330" offset="12179693">This is not a subsidy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.163" offset="12187007">We are required to pay this money the 25th of every month.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.204" offset="12203203">On the 5th of the next month, 10 days later, that money goes out to the out... to the in-state farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.217" offset="12227236">No money is going to the general revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.140" offset="12234968">No money is coming out of the general revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.820" offset="12241655">It is a price regime that is simply increasing how much we are paying, and that is precisely the description of the regime that the State sets forth in the pricing order itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.537" offset="12288571">With respect to the question of what kind of subsidy would or would not be appropriate, we submit that issue is not before the Court today, as it was not before the Court in New Energy, because we do not have a situation here where monies are coming from the general revenues of the State and going to support an in-state industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.338" offset="12355758">We do think that if there were a tightly focused tax on a specific industry and a tightly focused subsidy that reflected that tax that then went to someone involved in that same industry, that would also be unconstitutional, because that would have the same defects of the pricing order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.101" offset="12422841">But that is not before the Court today.</text>
