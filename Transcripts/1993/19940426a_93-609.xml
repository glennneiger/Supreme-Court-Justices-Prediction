            <text syncTime="42.369" offset="321115">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="45.171" offset="332400">Petitioners contend that section 27A of the Securities and Exchange Act violates the Constitution of the United States insofar as section 27A permits the reopening of final judgments granted to private parties in actions that are entirely closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.203" offset="408468">The issues before this Court are whether the statute constitutes an impermissible infringement upon the principle of the separation of powers and upon the powers of the judiciary and upon the individual rights of those litigants who appears before the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.626" offset="474193">The Courts of Appeals for the Sixth and the Tenth Circuits, as well as seven District Courts who have been faced with this issue, have recognized that this statute is in irreconcilable conflict with rules of law handed down by venerable and respected precedents of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.149" offset="552246">Consequently, they have held that the statute violates the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.640" offset="566248">The Fifth Circuit, from whose order we appeal, reached a contrary conclusion in large part on the basis of their holding that it was quite permissible for Congress to compel the courts to share parts of their judicial power with the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.752" offset="642735">We submit that that holding is unprecedented.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.225" offset="656632">It is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.527" offset="661752">And it should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.437" offset="669484">Now, as I have said, our challenge is based upon two related grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.781" offset="690800">The first is the separation of powers principle as set forth in Article III, and as early and authoritatively interpreted and implemented by this Court in Hayburn's Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.408" offset="737298">There is no question but that section 27A constitutes such an intrusion or an interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.212" offset="764570">Secondly, there is the point of the rights of the individuals which we... we contend that the judgment of the District Court, in essence, terminating Federal securities claims against the Petitioners constitutes a divestment of our due process rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.655" offset="842310">There is no issue that section 27A was passed in direct reaction to this Court's decision in Beam and Lampf.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.411" offset="877314">Indeed, the Respondent set forth at some length the legislation reactions... some might say it was overblown... but, in any event, there was no discussion that we can find, and Respondents, I don't believe, have cited any, of the constitutional problems which bring us here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.740" offset="938650">We do know that a statute was passed which overruled Beam, in essence... or at least the part of the statute that we are here today on--</text>

            <text syncTime="1614.023" offset="6607744">The legislation said, the following statutory requirements shall be deemed satisfied by meeting certain conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.037" offset="6635851">The fundamental distinction between legislation and adjudication, I think as this Court said in Robertson, as your own concurrence, I think in Freitag, reflects, as the Court said in the procedural due process portion of Concrete Pipe, is the difference between making law and, on the other hand, interpreting and applying law to particular facts and finding facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.461" offset="6721533">And the fundamental point I think about this statute is that it is legislative equally, whether Congress applied it to pending cases or to final cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.207" offset="6764478">The reason that this... that there is no challenge in this case to... or in... in any event, it is now conceded, as seven Circuits have held... that section 27A is fully legislative, as applied to pending cases, is that the relevant constitutional line has to do with the difference between adjudication and legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.282" offset="6852772">And that line is no more crossed when Congress acts with respect to pending or final cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1730.909" offset="7075335">The second proposition... and this is what the entire waiver discussion in Sioux Nation concerns... is to identify the source of Congress' particular power to change particular law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.576" offset="7113997">In Sioux Nation, the particular law changed was exactly res judicata law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.088" offset="7132073">And this Court said, res judicata law may be changed by Congress when it is essentially waiving its own right not to pay money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.203" offset="7164465">This case involves a change of law obviously within Congress' power under the Commerce Clause to set a limitation period for 10b... 10b-5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.627" offset="7198215">But the finality principle... namely, the idea that a change of law to reopen a judgment does not exercise judicial power... I think stands entirely independently.</text>

            <text syncTime="2201.276" offset="8956779">Now, on the due process side, it seems to me important to keep in mind the two different roles judgments can play.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.571" offset="8977990">A judgment can create a new right... a right in a judgment... like a judgment lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.512" offset="8993768">But I don't understand that there's been any argument that that kind of property right should somehow be treated as more sacrosanct than the right of title to property or a contract right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.969" offset="9031593">The other kind of right is what's talked about in all the cases concerning rights vested by a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.002" offset="9051655">And the judgment there simply plays the role of confirming the legal entitlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.045" offset="9067851">And it seems to me, again, upside-down to say that if the legal entitlement was so clear and indisputable that it never gave rise to litigation in the first place, that is subject only to due process rationality; whereas if it was sufficiently disputable and ambiguous that litigation resulted, that somehow the result... again, the underlying right is the property right... is protected as sacrosanct when... when a judgment has finally said, well, on balance, the right view of the existing legal entitlements is that you indeed have them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.075" offset="9188015">That seems to me to be exactly backwards, in terms of a role of a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.306" offset="9204942">And here, the judgment itself is being... is being raised to a level, by view... by reference to all of the vested rights cases... that indeed other vested rights, like contract rights and property rights are... are... have been held specifically by this Court to be subject to the rationality test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.299" offset="9276831">And, of course, this case doesn't involve other specific constitutional provisions, like the takings clause or the contract clause, where vested rights of a specific sort may have additional legal protection.</text>

            <text syncTime="3152.210" offset="12760521">Number one, the concept that this statute is not an interference, and that the courts can do whatever they want when they get back is belied by the language of the statute itself, which states that upon such a motion... excuse me... upon such a showing, the case shall... shall... be reinstated on motion by the plaintiff.</text>

            <text syncTime="3197.531" offset="12941810">I would ask the Court, in your leisure time, to look at page 10 of our reply brief, where we have cited three cases from this... this Court, including the O'Grady decision, which was cited by Chief Justice Rehnquist, in... in Sioux Nation, as well as two others... Jefferson and Waters, as well as, I might add, Your Honors, many cases from the Circuit Courts of Appeal and the State Supreme Courts, on which my learned adversaries turn a Nelsonian eye.</text>

            <text syncTime="3230.352" offset="13073050">Suppose Congress, instead of doing what it had done in this transition period, had said this particular claim, this 10b-5 claim, has a life of four years.</text>

            <text syncTime="3268.577" offset="13226023">We would cleave to our position, Your Honor, that that would be a violation of the separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.117" offset="13240129">It would merely be an evasion of the doctrine by the Congress simply saying, we know you had a final judgment on a two-year or three-year statute, now it's four years.</text>

            <text syncTime="3299.627" offset="13350157">From the Nixon decision at least, the phrase "potential disruption" is used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.020" offset="13371786">And if this isn't... in other words, if there is a potential disruption when branch A takes something from branch B, then that does not pass muster.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.455" offset="13405536">I... I commend to Your Honors that nothing could be more disruptive than the ability of the other branch to take from you perhaps your most precious attribute... and that is to terminate cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.312" offset="13444929">And those cases are entitled to just as much due process protection.</text>

            <text syncTime="3328.305" offset="13464886">It is just as valid as it was when it was decided in 1898, and it's cited every day... not every day... it is cited constantly by courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.550" offset="13493935">Your Honors, we submit that indeed... Justice Souter, the two doctrines do merge, although I think separation of powers is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.515" offset="13525699">And it actually, in essence, it is the reason we have a due process right, as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.098" offset="13544090">And for that reason it is our submission that the holding of the Fifth Circuit poses the gravest possible threat to this judicial system and to the persons who rely upon it every day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.836" offset="13595081">Therefore, we respectfully urge that the decision of the Fifth Circuit be reversed.</text>
