            <text syncTime="18.878" offset="227463">This case is about an issue of Federal common law, whether the important interests of overall fairness, finality of judgments, and judicial efficiency are best served by the practice of routinely vacating the trial court judgment when the parties settle on appeal, which is the practice in the Federal circuit and applied below in this case, or by a general rule denying vacatur on settlement and preserving the potential preclusive effects of the trial court judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.259" offset="332997">Petitioner urges the court to reject the Federal circuit practice and adopt a rule under which vacatur is not granted solely on the basis of settlement for three principal reasons:</text>
            <text syncTime="55.234" offset="372912">1) Vacatur on settlement is inconsistent with the Court's adoption of nonmutual collateral estoppel, which strikes the balance between fairness, finality, and efficiency in favor of finality when there has been a full and fair opportunity to litigate an issue; and--</text>
            <text syncTime="71.827" offset="439263">2) Although defended as achieving judicial efficiency, vacatur following voluntary settlement achieves only a false economy, because the cases in which vacatur is most important are precisely the cases in which there's most likely to be costlier future litigation, and finally,--</text>
            <text syncTime="89.538" offset="510108">3) Vacatur empowers a party who has lost on a claim after a full and fair trial to simply buy out the adverse judgment, defeat the policy's underlying collateral estoppel, and then unfairly force parties, such as Izumi and Sears in this particular matter, to defend claims which already had been rejected.</text>

            <text syncTime="1665.857" offset="6815440">If Your Honors please, in light of the discussion this morning, I'd like to first turn to the question of intervention, and then proceed to why this Court ought to reaffirm the rule that vacatur is available when a party's settlement completely moots their appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.783" offset="6867058">There are two questions raised by the intervention issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.416" offset="6877611">First, was it properly presented to this Court, and second, did the court of appeals abuse its discretion in denying vacatur?</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.889" offset="6903525">We submit the answer to the first question is no, it was not properly presented to this Court, and second, that the court of appeals properly denied intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.226" offset="6936857">The petition for certiorari raised a single question going to the merits of the issue of vacatur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.530" offset="6958068">The first time the issue of intervention was brought to the attention of this Court was in Philips' opposition to the petition for cert. There is nothing contained either within the question presented or within this Court's grant of the petition that would raise the issue of intervention, and therefore we respectfully submit that the issue was not properly presented to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.242" offset="7028912">As to the issue of the merits of the decision by the court of--</text>

            <text syncTime="1722.527" offset="7042078">Mr. Beeney, but wouldn't it be... it could come right back as a result of this now stayed interlocutory appeal in the Seventh Circuit, in the Federal circuit, from the district court, so isn't it kind of a wasted motion to say although Izumi was not a party in this particular proceeding, that very same question could come up via the appeal now lodged in the Federal circuit where Izumi is a party?</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.213" offset="7160779">I think, respectfully not, Justice Ginsburg, and the reason is this: there are two questions presented in that interlocutory appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.633" offset="7190454">The first one in which Izumi is a party has to do with the dismissal of their antitrust claim by the district court in Illinois that obviously did not present this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.489" offset="7225876">The second question raised in that interlocutory appeal is the issue of whether a vacated judgment should continue to have collateral effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.762" offset="7258999">That would not raise the propriety of the Federal circuit's granting of the vacation order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.398" offset="7281569">Well, what is the significance of the prior judgment, except for its preclusive effect?</text>

            <text syncTime="1813.352" offset="7405389">That is the only practical significance, but Izumi, in the currently pending Federal circuit appeal, takes the position, as it did before the district court in Illinois, that a vacated judgment under these circumstances ought to continue to have collateral effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.777" offset="7463068">And if, indeed... if the Federal circuit accepts Izumi's position that the vacated judgment does not... does continue to have collateral effect, then Izumi has no interest here whatsoever, because then the vacated judgment would be applied collaterally in Illinois, and their interest in the case that comes from Miami is completely vanished, because there is no interest whatsoever in that case, other than an attempt to use the judgment collaterally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.523" offset="7554078">So if Izumi prevails on that appeal, it has no interest in this case whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="2838.221" offset="11504837">I'd like to begin by addressing the questions about the precedential effect of opinions accompanying vacated judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.227" offset="11532841">In our view, the vacatur of a judgment renders the accompanying opinion of no precedential effect, so that it would not be binding on a district court or on a court of appeals panel if a previous opinion had... or the judgment accompanying a previous opinion had been vacated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.236" offset="11592922">We believe this Court said as much in County of Los Angeles v. Davis and the other cases cited in our brief. In keeping with the general rule set forth by this Court in United States v. Munsingwear, this Court has long followed a consistent practice of vacating lower court judgments when cases are rendered moot by settlement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2860.236" offset="11592922">But why isn't this case like W. T. Grant? This is a voluntary... where there's voluntary cessation, there isn't mootness, so in Munsingwear it's when something external to the parties causes the mootness, like someone dies, but here, it's the parties' very act, so I don't see that you can apply Munsingwear when Munsingwear speaks of something external to the parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="2860.236" offset="11592922">Well, Your Honor, it's true that mootness... that a case is not necessarily moot when one of the parties has merely ceased its conduct, and in those circumstances Munsingwear does not apply, but where the parties have reached a conclusive settlement agreement that binds the parties and conclusively resolves the case, as in this case, the district court entered a judgment of dismissal with prejudice. This case is not going to arise again in the future, so this is not like the W. T. Grant case, where the case is not truly moot, because the very same issue may... the very same circumstances could arise again.</text>

            <text syncTime="2860.236" offset="11592922">Well, it's truly moot. That isn't the point I think Justice Ginsburg was making. It is truly moot, but it's a different kind of mootness from the mootness that occurs without the cooperation of the parties, and not necessarily the kind of mootness that calls for a Munsingwear vacation of the judgment.</text>

Indeed, Munsingwear itself involved mootness that occurred as a result of the conduct of one of the parties, the United States, and the Court in numerous other cases that we've cited in our brief... Deakins v. Monaghan, the Webster case, the Frank v. Minnesota Newspaper Association case, cases decided on the merits as well as the summary opinions issued by the Court in settlement cases, all show that Munsingwear is not limited to the context of mootness that occurs for reasons outside of the litigation, that even where a party... for instance, in the Frank case where the Government changed its position with respect to the interpretation of a statute, and the plaintiff then said well, we are no longer interested in disputing this issue because we're satisfied with the Government's new position, this Court did not merely dismiss the appeal as the winning party below had suggested.

            <text syncTime="2860.236" offset="11592922">Your Honor, we believe that a discretionary rule would have considerable judicial diseconomies in that, it would require courts of appeals to weigh the various unclear factors in particular cases without clear guidance as to what factors should be given weight. It would be particularly problematic in this circumstance, because in the vast majority of these cases there would be no adversity. There would be no party to explain to the Court what, if any, reasons there were for denying vacatur, so the Court would in effect be making speculation about the possible future effect of its judgment in the absence of a presentation by adversary parties. We think that, moreover, the inducement to settlement provided by a certain rule of vacatur provides additional judicial economies because it encourages parties to enter into settlement agreements secure in the knowledge that vacatur will be available.</text>

            <text syncTime="2860.236" offset="11592922">Your Honor, we believe that the Court certainly has jurisdiction and power to reach the issue of vacatur. Certainly the fact that Izumi did not squarely present this question in their petition for certiorari, at least in the questions presented, suggests that the Court could deem... easily could waive the question, but the Court could either, as Justice Scalia suggested, treat the petition for certiorari as an implicit motion for intervention in this Court, or could conclude that the intervention question was somehow included in the question that was presented in the petition implicitly and therefore reach that question as well.

            <text syncTime="2860.236" offset="11592922">On the merits, Mr. Hungar, of course the problem of the court of appeals not having specific standards would be resolved by the rule the petitioner argues for that there be no vacatur in any circumstance, and what is your principle objection to that rule? Are you concerned in part that there might be judgments that are incorrect, or not well-founded, that become controlling law, or are you... or is that a concern?</text>

We believe that the problem with petitioner's position is that it places the interests of third parties and the principles and concerns underlying the doctrine of nonmutual collateral estoppel above the interests of the parties to the case precisely in circumstances where the premises for application of collateral estoppel do not apply. The premises for collateral estoppel are that application of that doctrine will ensure consistency of judgments, that we have reason to be confident in the correctness of the first adjudication, and that it will--</text>

            <text syncTime="2860.236" offset="11592922">Well, it's the desirability of settlement and certainty combined with the fact that the premises underlying nonmutual collateral estoppel do not apply here. Just as in the Mendoza case, where this Court held that nonmutual collateral estoppel would not be applied to the United States because when the United States is a party, there are countervailing considerations, such as the fact that the United States will bring many more appeals, thereby reducing the judicial economies that might otherwise be served by collateral estoppel, just as in the Mendoza case, where the Court adopted a bright line rule that said, because of these countervailing considerations, nonmutual collateral estoppel will not apply, we suggest that by parity of reasoning in this case, the Court should conclude that parties should be permitted to avoid nonmutual collateral estoppel by obtaining vacatur because the premises for nonmutual estoppel are not furthered here, and because the interests of certainty and fairness furthered by permitting settlement would be achieved by adhering to the Court's general rule of vacatur.</text>

            <text syncTime="2860.236" offset="11592922">Thank you, Your Honor. Just one point, and that is that the... a settlement of this type, which basically goes to the quantum of damages that were awarded for the antitrust violation, essentially buys out the adversarial interest, or incentive of the other party and allows through the settlement a claim such as the trade dress claim, which would be the subject of defensive nonmutual collateral estoppel, an asserted right by the party that lost, to be resuscitated just for the payment of enough money to satisfy the other party, and the only real interested parties who would be adversaries are the parties like Sears and Izumi, who are directly affected, and have already been shown to be affected, in the other litigation where that trade dress claim, once dead, has now come back to life, and that's why we say the vacatur on settlement rule completely undermines and is very much inconsistent with collateral estoppel, and the rule should be consistent.
