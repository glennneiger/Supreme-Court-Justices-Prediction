            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="153655">We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 92-1450, Cynthia Waters v. Cheryl Churchill.</text>

            <text syncTime="11.110" offset="198063">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.791" offset="208721">In this case, the court of appeals held that public officials risk substantial liability if they terminate employees based on believable reports of insubordinate remarks, substantiated by two other people, witnesses to the conversation in question, if other witnesses later come forward and convince a jury that the employee actually spoke on matters of concern to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.648" offset="316241">Although it... although it expressly rejected Churchill's claim of a right to due process under the First Amendment, the court of appeals nevertheless held that an employer unaware of protected speech because of an inadequate investigation may be held liable for retaliatory... retaliatory discharge, regardless of what the employer knew at the time of the termination, and even if its lack of knowledge was accidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.348" offset="442987">This unpreceded holding conflicts with this Court's requirement that protected speech be a substantial or motivating factor in the termination decision for a constitutional violation to be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.450" offset="499412">There is no evidence in this case, none at all, that defendants ever were informed that Cheryl Churchill had discussed issues of public concern on January 16, 1987 with a cross-trainee in that department, Melanie Perkins-Graham.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.731" offset="568479">Thus the defendants could not have intended to retaliate against Churchill for her allegedly protected speech when they made the decision to terminate her employment.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence A. Manson</label>
            <text syncTime="142.046" offset="721766">Your Honor, we believe that under the Celotex case and the rules of rule 56(e) on summary judgment, that when the moving party moves for summary judgment and the burden of proof for a particular issue is on the nonmoving party, it is incumbent upon the nonmoving party to present evidence that would sustain a jury verdict in that party's favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.591" offset="816016">And so what has happened here, we have moved for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.784" offset="828764">We have said that all the reports of protected speech that we... I'm sorry, all the reports of speech we heard about that conversation on January 16 related to personal grievances, and that there is no evidence to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.695" offset="884352">In fact, Your Honor, in the district court respondent conceded and said that they had no doubt that the report submitted by Mary Lou Ballew, who was the employee that overheard the conversation, and Melanie Perkins-Graham, who was a cross-trainee to which Cheryl Churchill spoke that evening... the respondent... the respondent had no doubt that those reports to the first level supervisor, Cindy Waters, and the director of nursing, Kathy Davis, could be construed in such a fashion, that is as unprotected speech.</text>

            <text syncTime="263.438" offset="1207330">But our contention here is that for there to be a violation of the First Amendment, the defendants must be motivated by knowing of protected speech, and our argument here is that all the defendants knew about was comments of personal matters, grievances against the supervisor.</text>

            <text syncTime="293.628" offset="1328120">That is correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.400" offset="1335226">The person that overheard the speech has been deposed several times.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.944" offset="1349332">She gave reports at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.303" offset="1354765">There are notes of those reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.464" offset="1363438">And what we contend is the defendants cannot be motivated against public speech if they don't know about it, and all they knew about was unprotected speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.149" offset="1398233">Let me give you an example of what they were told.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.011" offset="1409622">For... first of all, the employee that overhead the speech said that Churchill had talked to the cross-trainee about the problems in the department to the point where the cross-trainee wasn't interested in working there anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.365" offset="1495095">This is sabotage of the employer's training efforts in an understaffed department to try and get additional people trained there.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.631" offset="1524143">The witness was then asked:</text>
            <text syncTime="344.301" offset="1530831">"And what impelled you to make that report? "</text>
            <text syncTime="346.254" offset="1538667">And Mary Lou Ballew, the employee that overheard the conversation, said:</text>
            <text syncTime="350.125" offset="1554132">"I thought the OB Department was a good place to work and I hated to see people who wanted to work there being turned off by it. "</text>
            <text syncTime="356.990" offset="1581613">She then was asked:</text>
            <text syncTime="358.292" offset="1586733">"Why did you think she needed to know that. "</text>
            <text syncTime="359.892" offset="1593211">meaning the supervisor to whom she reported the speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.726" offset="1608466">And she said:</text>
            <text syncTime="364.597" offset="1612019">"I thought it had a detrimental effect on the department. "</text>
            <text syncTime="366.677" offset="1620274">"I thought it had foiled the attempt to get somebody in the department that could help with staffing. "</text>
            <text syncTime="372.200" offset="1642426">That's what impelled this employee, who overheard the conversation, to go to her supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.584" offset="1667921">Then we turn to the employee herself, the cross-trainee that was the subject of this speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.469" offset="1691431">She said that the overall message was not a positive one as far as Cheryl Churchill's relationship with her immediate supervisor, Cindy Waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.425" offset="1727271">She said at her deposition that the general gist of the conversation was negative feelings between Cheryl Churchill and her immediate supervisor, Cindy Waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.312" offset="1762902">She said in the... in the... it's reflected in the notes of her conversation with Kathy Davis, the director of the nursing area, and Cindy Waters, the director of that unit, that she recognized that... at the end of that conversation she said:</text>
            <text syncTime="418.162" offset="1826223">"I know that the hospital cannot tolerate this kind of negative attitude. "</text>
            <text syncTime="423.535" offset="1847748">So we had... we had these reports from both the cross-trainee to which Cheryl Churchill spoke, and we had the report of the employee that overheard the conversation, an employee working in an understaffed department of the hospital who, perhaps because it's understaffed, has to take more on call or work weekends.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.679" offset="1916293">And we had those reports and that is the only information that could possibly motivate the employer.</text>
