          <turn speaker="john_v_jansonius" startTime="65.863" stopTime="184.672">
            <label>Mr. John V. Jansonius</label>
            <text syncTime="65.863" offset="408564">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="73.059" offset="437298">Remedies in unfair labor practices are public remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.010" offset="453181">The issue in this case is whether an individual who testifies in an unfair labor practice case under oath, and who testifies untruthfully, may share in the remedy that may be entered at the conclusion of that proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.390" offset="498634">This case was filed as a consolidated case involving several dockworkers who worked for ABF Freight system in Albuquerque.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.002" offset="525070">Ironically, the only one of those dockworkers to prevail in this case is Mr. Michael Manso.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.038" offset="545236">Mr. Manso was discharged on August 17, 1989, ostensibly for being late for work that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.269" offset="570209">At the hearing in Albuquerque, he testified as to the reason he was late for work.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.142" offset="585674">He said that his car had broken down on the way in, that he'd had to call his wife and that she came and picked him up and then took him on to work, at which time he was pulled over by a highway patrolman.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.307" offset="618275">The judge heard all that testimony, and the judge concluded that Mr. Manso was lying in testifying as to his reason for being late for work that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.104" offset="653488">In an adversary system for resolving disputes, we believe that the oath that a witness takes is absolutely vital, that it's fundamental to the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.911" offset="692776">The first step to correctly applying the law is to decide the facts correctly in the first place, and a witness who does not honor the oath makes that process much more difficult for the courts and in this case for the administrative law judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.731" offset="748051">Perhaps more than in any other context in the Federal system a correct outcome on the facts in unfair labor practice cases is dependent on witnesses honoring their oaths.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.907" offset="792773">Whether or not a complaint is even to be filed in the first instance is normally decided by counsel for the general counsel or by the regional offices of the NLRB simply based on affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.655" offset="835718">Individuals who give statements to the NLRB's are under oath, and their statements are taken at face value for the most part, and whether or not there is even going to be a case depends on whether that individual is giving a true affidavit.</text>

            <text syncTime="815.861" offset="3408570">I believe that it is an arbitrary position, if not just an erroneous as a matter of law position, for the NLRB to state that someone who abuses the process by coming in and giving false testimony is entitled to backpay and reinstatement, and that doing that will effectuate the purposes of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.354" offset="3482549">I don't see how the Board can make that case that putting somebody back to work, giving them backpay in this situation, is going to effectuate the purposes of the act, and I think that is why the Congress assigned this Court with supervisory responsibility over the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.013" offset="3541168">There have been many instances over the years where this Court looked at NLRB remedies and made the conclusion that what the NLRB did perhaps ran afoul or interfered with other Federal policies and corrected the Board on the remedy that it entered, and this is one of those situations where I believe that is appropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1091.083" offset="4509475">I believe section 10(c) of the act makes some remedies nondiscretionary with the Board and makes it clear that they have to enter some forms of--</text>

            <text syncTime="1104.521" offset="4563183">I think what really separates this case from the standard unfair labor practice case where the discretion has been accorded the Board to mold the remedies under section 10(c) with very little review is the fact that we do have other policies that come into play here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.802" offset="4620338">Typically, the NLRB is deciding strictly labor disputes that don't have ramifications that go outside the National Labor Relations Act where the Federal policies are impacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.516" offset="4659209">This one does, and that's why I think it's appropriate for the Court here to take a hand in directing the Board and supervising it, and what remedies are to be entered in this rather narrow context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.895" offset="4700691">But there's no provision in the statute that directly addresses it, and I can't imagine that Congress really thought of this situation... what's going to happen with a charging party who comes in and lies, and what should the Board do then?</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.713" offset="4755966">Congress was concerned when it considered the National Labor Relations Act about the lack of safeguards for truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.516" offset="4779163">When the bill was originally considered in the Senate, it specifically provided that the rules of evidence were not to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.011" offset="4805181">That was the subject of some debate in Congress, and there was a lot of testimony that this was... before the Congress at the time that this was not a good policy, that the rules of evidence should be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.290" offset="4850216">And after debating the issue, Congress did a turnaround and made section 10... put in section 10(b) that the Federal Rules of Evidence were to be applied insofar as practicable in unfair labor practice proceedings, and I think that indicated that Congress had some concern with the lack of safeguards for truth in the unfair labor practice context, and did what they could to see that the oath was made a part of the process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1297.461" offset="5334944">There's a few points I'd like to make in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.591" offset="5343408">First, as I said in my opening comment, getting at the true facts of the case is the first step to correctly applying the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.567" offset="5379352">If a witness is not going to honor the oath, that's going to interfere with the NLRB's and any other agency's ability to get at the true facts and to correctly apply the law, so just from a very broad proposition, a witness who is not telling the truth is undermining an agency's ability to enforce and protect the purposes of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.800" offset="5460332">There are other reasons as well why I believe that the Board's order in this case cannot possibly effectuate the purposes of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.087" offset="5493455">First of all, I think it's just common sense that putting someone like Mr. Manso back to work is going to be saddling ABF with a contractual relationship with someone who it has very good grounds not to trust, and there's certainly going to be a loss of respect between the employer and employee, and I don't think that a working relationship with someone who has taken advantage of the system and the employer the way Mr. Manso has could be said to do anything to reduce labor strife or to promote the free flow of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.177" offset="5613827">I think that the act, the purposes of the act are frustrated in this context by encouraging false claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.920" offset="5640786">The NLRB is going to look like a very friendly forum to charging parties... and it should be a receptive forum, I'm not saying that, otherwise... but it's going to look like a system where the Government can be taken advantage of, and I don't think that effectuates the purposes of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.008" offset="5697106">I think the remedy that the Board has ordered in this case undermines ABF's collectively bargained agreements procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.574" offset="5723437">Mr. Manso went through the agreements procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.215" offset="5733991">A three... or six-member panel equally composed of labor and management concluded that he should not be put back to work, concluded that he was not entitled to backpay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.151" offset="5765651">Given what's happened, I think that the Grievance Committee that ABF has negotiated with the local union of the Teamsters is going to look like a less receptive forum, and there's going to be more tendency to try and sidestep the grievance procedure knowing that the NLRB is going to be more forgiving of those who try to take advantage of the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.284" offset="5842242">For all those reasons, I think that the Board's order in this case, or in any similar context, is not effectuating the purposes of the act, and again I would say that I think that the NLRB needs to be reminded that it does not apply the act in a vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.825" offset="5912355">This Court has said several times that other considerations have to be taken into account when crafting unfair labor practice remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.499" offset="5939104">It did so in Sure-Tan, it did so in Detroit Edison, it did so in Lechmere, it's done so in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.993" offset="5961047">And the NLRB in this case did apply the act in a vacuum, it did take a very narrow reading of public policy, and looked strictly at the National Labor Relations Act instead of taking other concerns into account which we believe that they are compelled to do, and we believe that this Court as the supervisor over the NLRB should make it clear to them that they've got to take the oath seriously, that it is a public policy that it be honored, and that should be made a stronger part of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1607.508" offset="6575134">And then about twelve lines from the bottom of this provision there is a sentence that begins, just past the middle of the line, that says,</text>

            <text syncTime="1639.027" offset="6701253">Except for that provision, one searches in vain for an express limitation in the statute on the Board's remedial authority in ordering reinstatement or backpay in accordance with the Board's judgment of what will effectuate the policies of the act, and in this case there was a determination made by the Board... on page B-21 of the appendix to the petition... that this was not a discharge for cause, that the cause given was a pretext for discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.367" offset="6874601">That finding was upheld by the court of appeals... on pages A-14 to A-18 of the appendix to the petition... and that question is not at issue here under the Court's limited grant of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.339" offset="6946490">So the only express limitation in the statute that the courts obviously would have to consider enforcing against the Board in limiting its remedial authority is not applicable here, and the question becomes, as Justice Kennedy very aptly phrased it in his question, whether the Board was arbitrary in... has been arbitrary in the standards it has adopted in determining when reinstatement and backpay will effectuate the policies of the act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1800.927" offset="7348776">The Court emphasized that because the relation of remedy to policy, which is the statutory criterion, is peculiarly a matter for administrative competence, courts must not enter the allowable area of the Board's discretion and must guard against the danger of sliding unconsciously from the narrow confines of law into the more spacious domain of policy.</text>
