            <text syncTime="55.629" offset="373697">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="61.032" offset="395326">The case before this Court involves whether the double jeopardy principles of Bullington should be extended to noncapital sentencing proceedings, whether doing so would be Teague-barred, and, indeed, whether Bullington should be overturned.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.594" offset="469514">The purpose of sentencing is to assure that the punishment fits the offender, and not merely the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.889" offset="506712">Defendant's status, and not his conduct, is the linchpin of sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.573" offset="533462">The rehabilitation of a defendant is a factor that the sentencer should consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.748" offset="566167">Because sentencing focuses on the proper punishment, the Double Jeopardy Clause has never prevented a sentencer from imposing a higher sentence upon resentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.156" offset="607858">In fact, in United States v. DiFrancesco, this Court stated that the task is to determine whether the criminal sentence, once pronounced, is to be accorded constitutional finality and conclusiveness similar to that which attaches to a jury's verdict of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.270" offset="684240">This Court stated:</text>
            <text syncTime="135.481" offset="693122">"We conclude that neither the history of sentencing practices, nor the pertinent rulings of the court, not even consideration of double jeopardy policy, supports an equation. "</text>
            <text syncTime="145.799" offset="734396">The procedures required for sentencing a defendant as a persistent offender in Missouri include pleading the prior convictions in the indictment, or information, introduction of evidence of the defendant's prior convictions at a hearing conducted outside the presence of the jury and prior to submitting the case to the jury, and a finding by the judge that the defendant is a persistent offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.653" offset="825824">The statute allows for the use of presentence investigation reports and commitments as proof of a prior conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.249" offset="860201">Case law in Missouri has established that introduction... introducing certified copies of prior convictions and commitment reports is prima facie proof that the defendant is the person named in the prior convictions for the purpose of the habitual offender statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.149" offset="927806">Once a prima facie proof is made, the burden shifts to the defendant to disprove the prior convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.795" offset="958317">If the defendant fails to rebut the prima facie proof, the trial court may rely on that prior... those prior convictions for invoking the habitual offender statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="345.782" offset="1534265">The court below found that it was not Teague-barred, because they said you could stretch Bullington into the application of non... noncapital sentencing proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.260" offset="1568224">And our position is that stretching Bullington alone would be Teague-barred, because it is not dictated by past precedents of this case... this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="391.809" offset="1718376">If this Court were to apply that... that Bullington doesn't apply to noncapital sentencing proceedings, we wouldn't have the issue of whether it's Teague-barred.</text>

            <text syncTime="586.283" offset="2496302">The only thing that is in the record, Your Honor, is at the trial... the prosecutor on the morning of trial, at a pretrial conference, stated that he was willing to proceed.</text>

            <text syncTime="604.503" offset="2569236">One of the purposes of double jeopardy is to prevent a defendant from being retried and convicted, although innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.290" offset="2604345">However, the possibility of innocence of a sentence cannot occur, because a sentence... second sentencing decision is as correct as a first jury sentencing decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.507" offset="2645200">Even if the trial court determines that the prosecutor failed to meet the statutory obligation for establishing defendant to be an habitual offender, the prosecutor failure is not an implied acquittal of the prior convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.136" offset="2695774">Nothing would prohibit the use of those prior convictions in a subsequent proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="744.506" offset="3129197">These facts, coupled with the prosecutor's requirement to prove certain statutorily defined facts beyond a reasonable doubt, and the jury's limitation of imposing either life or death, led this Court to believe the Double Jeopardy Clause applied to capital sentencing proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="934.899" offset="3890823">I want to make two points this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.490" offset="3901168">The first is that the Court's decision in Bullington v. Missouri is distinguishable from this case and does not control the outcome here, and the second point is that the Court ought not to extend Bullington to cover this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.439" offset="3948920">On the first point, we submit that the persistent offender determination in Missouri is quite unlike the trial-like process that was at issue in Bullington.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.486" offset="3989148">In the penalty phase of a capital case like Bullington, the procedure is very much trial-like.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.093" offset="4019555">The Court relied on that factor heavily in Bullington, and in this case, and in persistent offender determinations generally, those features are not fully present.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.269" offset="4056231">In a capital case like Bullington, because it was like a trial with a verdict, quote, on the question of life or death, the Court thought, and was willing to treat the outcome of that proceeding as though it were analogous to be a conviction or a verdict on the question of guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.765" offset="4138255">The persistent offenders determination in Missouri is far different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.997" offset="4155182">Unlike the penalty phase of a capital case, that determination is made by the judge at a hearing, not a trial, outside the presence of a jury prior to the case's submission to the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="1025.913" offset="4254866">My point here, however, is that the hearing in this case is unlike the hearing that was at issue in Bullington, and also in Rumsey, in that it was not trial-like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.708" offset="4294049">It was merely a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.729" offset="4298125">It was not... it did not contain the full measure of trial-like aspects that is typically at issue and present in the penalty phase of a capital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.557" offset="4333442">For example, in... under this statute, the defendant is not entitled to the full panoply of constitutional trial rights, there are no opening and closing arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.733" offset="4366147">In short, the judge hears evidence and decides the factual question whether the defendant is or is not a persistent offender, and then the trial resumes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1066.408" offset="4416825">It is not the outcome of the sentencing process, like a verdict or a decision on life or death.</text>

            <text syncTime="1217.137" offset="5019731">First, this Court's subsequent decision in Poland v. Arizona emphasized quite heavily the life or death nature of the decision in Bullington and was willing to treat that as an implied acquittal type situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.154" offset="5063826">But more... more importantly, it seems to me that the States are under no constitutional compulsion, in the case that you described, to provide such procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.591" offset="5101547">So in such a case, a State would have the argument that it ought not have to pay the price of not being able to correct errors if it provides defendants with more procedures to which... than they are constitutionally entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.337" offset="5144492">So there would be an arguable distinction in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.288" offset="5156299">That, of course, is not a question the Court has to reach in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1266.098" offset="5215545">But let me emphasize again that the rationale of Bullington was that because there was this full trial-like process and because it was a question of life or death, an up-down, yes-no question, then the Court was willing to treat the outcome of that proceeding as though it were a verdict on the question of life of death, i.e. innocent or guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.713" offset="5294017">That analysis stands alone in this Court's sentencing cases relating to double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.404" offset="5312825">We submit that it should not be extended any further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.936" offset="5322960">In this country there has never been, under traditional sentencing practices, any impediment to the correction of errors on resentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.991" offset="5355143">This Court, in Poland v. Arizona, declined to extend Bullington outside the context in which it arose, that is where there was a full trial-like procedure with an ultimate determination of life or death.</text>

            <text syncTime="1942.110" offset="7919636">One is the existence of jury sentencing, and clearly that makes no difference in terms of the application of Bullington, as this Court decided in Arizona v. Rumsey.</text>

            <text syncTime="2909.999" offset="11791192">In that particular situation, then, the judge would have made the appropriate ruling and the case would have gone to the jury that would have been the end of the situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2933.265" offset="11884293">I would like very briefly to address the concerns that have been raised by the Government concerning the application of any decision in this case to the possible sentencing guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.330" offset="11920551">I think there are a number of distinctions that can be drawn from the case involving Mr. Bohlen and, in fact, the situation involving the sentencing guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.125" offset="11955659">First of all, the standard of proof is significantly different; the preponderance of the evidence that's sufficient for the Government to carry the weight in the sentencing guidelines situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.812" offset="11990454">And also the Court... this Court recognized in Poland v. Arizona that they're not going to break up that sentencing determination into several groups of minitrials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.198" offset="12027966">But this is a situation, in this case, where there is one verdict that was reached, and that is whether or not this individual had been... should properly be classified as a persistent offender.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="3076.265" offset="12456270">The intervention, whether the Federal circuit erred in refusing to allow Izumi to intervene was not a cosmic question.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frank A. Jung</label>
            <text syncTime="3086.172" offset="12495871">--Correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.753" offset="12498170">They said to decide that wouldn't be that important of a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.716" offset="12510082">Plus also in Izumi, we think, is distinguished because in Izumi it was objected to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.919" offset="12526905">In the respondent's brief there was no objected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.281" offset="12536309">We would assert there'd be a waiver in that situation, to the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.713" offset="12549997">The issue that I'd like to raise here on rebuttal, Your Honors, are that respondent seems to assert that we're not looking at the double jeopardy applying to sentencing, we're determining to the status.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.770" offset="12598271">Clearly, if they're asking it to apply to a status, it would be a new rule implication, because this Court has never decided that it applies to the status of an habitual offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.927" offset="12634843">The status is no different from the factual question of sentencing, but it is a distinction that a court has made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.733" offset="12666085">The issue of whether double jeopardy applies to noncapital cases is subject to debate, as Justice O'Connor has noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.467" offset="12697014">In a recent case in which... we informed respondent's counsel, and was decided only a month ago in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.711" offset="12718017">In People v. Levin, the Illinois Supreme Court declined to apply the Bullington to a not... their habitual offender statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.729" offset="12762111">And it shows that reasonable jurors can disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.550" offset="12777367">In fact, in the Lee case, the Lee case did discuss the Bullington and distinguished... it said this is not Bullington.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.585" offset="12805475">We think that's a good-faith analysis of the existing precedent at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.859" offset="12826582">As to the exceptions, surely respondent is not stating that an habitual offender is a protected class which should be implied under the first exception under Teague.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.199" offset="12871930">Are we encouraging habitual offenders, to state that you are a protected class of individuals that obtain a right, that will not be punished because of the new... because of an enactment of a new rule?</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.328" offset="12916547">I would disagree with that, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.700" offset="12925951">Lastly, as I think the Court noted, was there is a distinction regarding the accuracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.264" offset="12948208">As Justice Souter pointed out, this gives a more accurate consideration for the jury or for a sentencer to impose, knowing the background of a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.711" offset="12990004">Whether it be a judge or jury, they should have all rights of the facts... history of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.326" offset="13016440">Even in capital cases, this Court has decided that juries should have the broadest spectrum of information of a defendant's background before deciding his fate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.903" offset="13054787">That would make it more accurate, the same way as this... this situation.</text>
