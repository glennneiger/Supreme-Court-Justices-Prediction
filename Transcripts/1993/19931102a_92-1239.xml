            <text syncTime="10.104" offset="185264">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.889" offset="200415">A ruling which the petitioner requests in this case is a determination that gender-based peremptory jury challenges are prohibited under the heightened scrutiny of the Fourteenth Amendment such that the procedures established in Batson v. Kentucky would apply in that context also.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.534" offset="275021">The facts which are relevant to the review of this case reveal that from a panel of 33 potential jurors, the State of Alabama in this cause struck 9... used 9 of its strikes to strike men from the jury and used 1 of its strikes to strike a female.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.514" offset="350985">The petitioner used a peremptory strike to strike a male from the jury, resulting in an all-female panel to try this case, which resulted in a determination in favor of the state of paternity in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.007" offset="408872">The position of the petitioner in this case is based upon three factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.160" offset="429561">The first is that the same principle which prohibits gender-based exclusion from the jury venire also excludes gender-based elimination or peremptory strikes in the formation of a petit jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.670" offset="491524">Secondly, under the heightened scrutiny of the Equal Protection Clause applicable to gender discrimination, the State's interest in limiting further restrictions on the exercise of peremptory challenges is not significant enough to overcome the invidious harm caused by gender-based peremptory challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.549" offset="559024">And finally, the harm to the petitioner, the excluded jurors, and society as a whole is substantially similar in the use of gender-based peremptory challenges as that we find from race-based peremptory challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.475" offset="618792">The fact that this panel ended up being all female simply highlights the injury to the entire community when a group, such as males or females, were eliminated from the jury panel because of group bias or unwarranted stereotyping, and when those... that stereotyping becomes the basis for the exclusion of otherwise qualified jurors from the judicial process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1178.633" offset="4859406">For nearly 2 decades the Court has held that Government action taken on the basis of gender is subject to heightened constitutional scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.656" offset="4891484">In light of that heightened scrutiny, the discriminatory use of peremptory challenges to remove a juror on the basis of gender violates the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.512" offset="4926907">The line of cases beginning with this Court's decision in Batson has made it clear that the use of peremptory challenges for racially invidious purposes is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.467" offset="4970792">Such challenges harm not only the parties, but also the excluded jurors and the community as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.140" offset="4997437">The same is true with respect to gender-based strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.425" offset="5010603">The individual juror removed on the basis of gender is frequently the victim of an outmoded stereotype.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.829" offset="5036203">Jury manuals, for example, have instructed litigants to remove women because of a belief that they are too sympathetic or are governed by emotion, and the case law reflects that this has happened.</text>
