            <text syncTime="506.833" offset="2170990">In addition to that, the failure to follow the suggested compliance approach would subject them to penalties both civil and criminal, and the Court found in those two circumstances that this was sufficient ripeness for the action to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.073" offset="2239953">Under the Toilet Goods... Gardner v. Toilet Goods case, the Court found that the application of the regulations there were more general.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.418" offset="2273286">They were not... they did not require immediate action.</text>

Dewey, the one prior occasion on which this Court considered the Federal Mine Safety Act of 1977, and in particular its inspection provisions, and upheld their constitutionality against a Fourth Amendment challenge under Marshall v. Barlows, because no warrants are required for the periodic inspections prescribed by this act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.501" offset="7393599">And in deciding that this was permissible for Congress in treating this industry under this statutory scheme, the Court pointed out at page 602 of Volume 452 U.S. that Congress was plainly aware that the mining industry is among the most hazardous in the country, and that the poor health and safety record of this industry has significant deleterious effects on interstate commerce, and the Court there cited some of the provisions in the pre--</text>

Dewey, and we've reproduced this provision on page 1A of the appendix to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.360" offset="7941021">The first one that the Court referred to is (c) here, there is an urgent need to provide more effective means and measures for improving the working conditions and practices in the Nation's coal and other mines in order to prevent death and serious physical harm, and in order to prevent occupational diseases originating in such mines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.175" offset="8036316">Part of what Congress did in this legislation was to, for basically the same reasons, replace what it found to be cumbersome, repetitious, and ineffective enforcement mechanisms in the prior law which it complained in the committee reports were allowing protracted litigation while the conditions that were cited by the Secretary of Interior, who was administering at that time, went uncorrected, and it replaced this with a restructured and streamlined enforcement scheme that is the scheme at issue here, and it created the Federal Mine Safety Commission, a new agency independent of the Department of Labor, to hear complaints, and for the first time it included a system of daily penalties that could be imposed for failure to abate a violation after the violation has been cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.217" offset="8340486">The whole structure and purpose reflected in the legislative history that we cite and that the Court itself cited in Donovan v. Dewey in footnote 7, referring to the pertinent Senate and House reports, was to tilt the balance away from the direction of protracted litigation while the violation remained uncorrected toward a system that would provide incentives to correct the violation and protect the health and safety of the miners and then do the litigating.</text>

            <text syncTime="3199.208" offset="12940440">What I'm suggesting about the Abbott Labs trilogy is that while there is no crisp distinction about when a preenforcement review has been recognized, a good deal of light is shed on that by the distinction that does exist in administrative law between legislative regulations in which new substantive standards are being imposed that affect primary conduct, and that is what the Court talked about in Abbott Labs, that primary conduct was being affected by what the agency did in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.005" offset="13103653">And in the companion case that was held to be ripe for review, Gardner v. Toilet Goods, the Court referred to what the agency had done as amplifying the statutory standard imposing new standards that will affect the primary conduct of the people who brought the challenge, whereas interpretations, or even interpretive regulations, just purport to state the agency's position about the meaning of the statute that someone can litigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.571" offset="13265926">Now, typically, when there are provisions for review of the validity of the new legislative regulations, they have to be brought quite promptly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.990" offset="13311588">In this statute itself, there's a 60-day provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.513" offset="13329664">The suits in Abbott Laboratories were brought within a matter of months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.587" offset="13361952">The regulations there were adopted in June '63, and the suit was filed in September of '63, and in the Toilet Goods case in November of '63 for regulations adopted in June of '63.</text>

            <text syncTime="3334.206" offset="13480443">I mean, there are statutory provisions that say the challenge must be brought within 60 days, but I had always thought that unless there is such a statutory provision, you can challenge a regulation whenever.</text>
