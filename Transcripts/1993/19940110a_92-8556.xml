            <text syncTime="593.577" offset="2526597">But I think that the important distinction in this case is that the Sentencing Guidelines have brought a new dimension to sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.281" offset="2549480">There are certain things where there is no discretion, and one of them is the Guideline range.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.216" offset="2569229">The Guideline range does automatically increase when there is... when there is the use, for instance, of this prior uncounseled misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.419" offset="2597964">Now, why should the court be concerned about an uncounseled misdemeanor where there is only a money fine?</text>
            <text syncTime="619.998" offset="2632341">The reason for that is, I think, found in the history of Gideon v. Wainwright, Argersinger, where the Court found first that, from its previous decisions, the right to counsel is very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.424" offset="2678003">Even an educated person in a court is not able to follow all the rules of the court, is not able to understand the processes of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.869" offset="2703812">Now, what happened was after Argersinger, the Scott v. Illinois decision gave the line, the clear line that if incarceration was involved, then the conviction was unconstitutional if there was no counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.680" offset="2759087">If there was incarceration, there simply had to be counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.221" offset="2777164">Now, that court... in my view, the case recognizes the fact that an uncounseled misdemeanor is inherently unreliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.345" offset="2809660">Day in and day out in the counties where... in the county where I practice, and I think all over the country, the lower courts, the sessions courts, the municipal courts, hear thousands and thousands of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.112" offset="2848739">They have crowded dockets.</text>

            <text syncTime="677.717" offset="2863159">What's happened with Scott v. Illinois is that we have created a type of case where an individual faced with an offense is likely to opt not to pay for a lawyer, if they're able to hire one, because of the expense of doing so, because all they've got to do to avoid this problem is to enter a plea of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.112" offset="2940795">The initial conviction is constitutional.</text>

I mean rather once it's constitutional because there's only a money fine, if we do not say that it later becomes unconstitutional if we're trying to impose incarceration, is that we will be relying upon thousands of convictions which are inherently unreliable because of the reality of life out there in the court system.</text>

            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>
            <text syncTime="1684.786" offset="6891449">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.599" offset="6910676">Our position in this case is that a valid uncounseled misdemeanor conviction can be used for sentence enhancement even if it could not support a sentence of imprisonment in its own right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.347" offset="6961667">And we base this contention on three propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.299" offset="6973474">First, a particular factor does not need to be sufficient to support a criminal conviction and imprisonment in order to be used at sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.377" offset="7013807">Second, there is nothing so inherently unreliable about a valid uncounseled misdemeanor conviction that would bar its use in a later sentencing proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.634" offset="7050901">And third, an enhanced sentence for a second offense is not simply an additional sentence for a first offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.560" offset="7086532">Instead, it's a sentence for the second offense that is imposed on a person who has a criminal record, that takes account of the fact that the person has a criminal record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.225" offset="7129268">Now, let me address each of these three points in more detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.257" offset="7141389">First, it's a well-settled principle of sentencing law that this Court has reiterated again and again, that the Court in sentencing may consider a very broad range of factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.166" offset="7184961">Just because a particular factor would not have supported, in itself, a sentence of imprisonment, doesn't mean it can't be used at sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.371" offset="7217771">And this--</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="1766.942" offset="7220070">Mr. Bryson, isn't there a difference between using a factor at sentencing when the judge has broad discretion, on the one hand, and having an automatic enhancement by adding to the criminal history score and making him... perhaps making him eligible for imprisonment for the first time?</text>

            <text syncTime="1782.715" offset="7283182">And for this reason, because it... suppose a judge were to say I would have let you... I would have given you probation, but I see that you have this on your record and therefore I'm going to give you 2 years; that's a discretionary call by the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.944" offset="7332083">It's exactly the same, we submit, as having a guidelines system or some other system of guided discretion that tells the judge that for a first offense you should give an extra 2 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="1804.451" offset="7370117">Yes, but you have to acknowledge that here there's a difference that if you didn't have the automatic addition of the point and the judge took evidence and found that there was this bad conduct committed in the form of a misdemeanor, whether a valid conviction or not, he would have discretion as to whether to enhance or not, but under the Guidelines he doesn't.</text>

            <text syncTime="2530.089" offset="10272635">And they get a civil... they bring a civil action and they get a civil judgment with an injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2549.904" offset="10351942">He goes before a court and the judge says I would have given you probation for this criminal act, but I'm not going to do it now because I see... based on this civil judgment for which the defendant did not have a lawyer, I regard that as a reliable indication that you are effectively a second-time offender in this... in this activity and therefore I'm going to give you jail time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.587" offset="10442640">There's nothing conceivably wrong with that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2966.142" offset="12016883">I'm sorry, Your Honor... made the argument that the fact that you can't directly impose an extra term of... a term of imprisonment for a misdemeanor conviction is inconsistent with allowing you indirectly to impose it by using that misdemeanor conviction at sentencing for another crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.969" offset="12112178">And if you can't do it directly, you can't do it indirectly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.602" offset="12122731">But that I think overlooks the fundamental difference between sentencing somebody for a crime and sentencing somebody for a later crime in which you are using the fact of the prior conviction, not to give them extra time because of... as a means... as a mode of punishing them for the first conviction, but rather to use as a fact the fact that this person has a criminal history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.069" offset="12232654">And let me just use another hypothetical, if I may, to try to demonstrate that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.853" offset="12255747">Suppose you have someone who is convicted of rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.356" offset="12265778">And under Coker against Georgia, that could not lead to a sentence of death, we know that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.740" offset="12295244">Suppose that subsequently that person commits murder and the determination of the sentencer is based on the fact of the murder and, as an aggravating circumstance, the fact of the rape, you are going to get the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.410" offset="12353967">Now, in that setting it could be said... to follow Justice Marshall's analysis, it could be said that the rape, in effect, resulted in the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.485" offset="12386254">And yet we know that that isn't a punishment for the rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.639" offset="12406839">That is a punishment for the murder, which is authorized... the death penalty is authorized because the person has a history of violent crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="3071.516" offset="12438395">Well, another way of looking at it is that we don't really care whether it's for the first or the second or some combination, because both have been counseled convictions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3097.615" offset="12542780">I think that's open to argument in that case that you put.</text>

            <text syncTime="3113.747" offset="12607355">And that's my only point with respect to the hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.399" offset="12613938">It does, I think, demonstrate that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.801" offset="12619580">Finally, I think to look at the question of the importance of this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.387" offset="12653853">Counsel suggests that this really isn't all that important and that the States can live with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.600" offset="12678721">Well, of course the States can live with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.042" offset="12684468">If you tell them they have to live with it, they will.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.843" offset="12695649">But I think it's... it's, in fact, very important that the States be able to conduct recidivism programs, and to the extent that we do, that the United States be able to do that, in which you do give leniency to someone who is a first-time offender, in which you do take account of the fact that the person has a criminal record when they come back and they do it again, and that you do sentence those people much more harshly than you would the first offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.121" offset="12800765">What, in effect, the rule of Baldasar, if extended to this case, would do is to say that everyone, at least everyone who didn't bring a lawyer with them to a misdemeanor... a prior misdemeanor proceeding, or who didn't have the State appoint them a lawyer for every misdemeanor... everyone is to be treated as a first offender every time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.755" offset="12891358">And drunk driving is a perfect example of where we say, well, first time a fine, second time a heavier fine, third time jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.742" offset="12927302">And yet if you follow the theory of Baldasar into this setting, what you're saying is there's never a second time and there's never a third time unless, of course, the State decides to provide everybody with a lawyer, even if they're only going to have a $250 fine, as in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.744" offset="12995325">And we think the Sixth Amendment does not require that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3220.203" offset="13033151">Your Honor, the structure of the Sentencing Guidelines have made convictions very different from prior conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.537" offset="13050496">Prior conduct can be used to change the sentence within the range, but not to automatically enhance to a different range, and that is a distinct... the distinction of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.094" offset="13088739">This case is like Baldasar in that sense; it increased automatically to a higher range.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.648" offset="13106920">Now, original convictions... the original conviction in Georgia was constitutional, but it wasn't constitutional for all purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.341" offset="13133670">That's so even under Scott.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.993" offset="13140253">And we think that there are examples... I mentioned that the criminal... the juvenile adjudication is an example of that, where an offense was valid for one purpose and not for another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.188" offset="13181108">I believe it was Lewis, Lewis v. United States, where the Court had a situation where someone had a prior felony uncounseled which clearly would have been not useable for many purposes, but it was used for the limited purpose of preventing somebody the status of not possessing a pistol or not possessing a weapon of some kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.427" offset="13286016">That is an obvious example also of offenses being used for different purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.651" offset="13302943">I believe that in this case a rule that recognizes that this offense is not reliable and perhaps not fair, perhaps fairness is another... another element of this... to be used by someone who unsuspectingly is led to believe that this is of little consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.083" offset="13368667">Later on it's used to impose imprisonment; I suggest that's inappropriate.</text>
