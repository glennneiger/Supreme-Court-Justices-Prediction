            <text syncTime="208.861" offset="989146">We didn't go into the facts of the other benefits in the case because as a matter of fact the judge sustained their motion for failure to state a cause of action, so there was no fact hearing on the measure of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.105" offset="1042122">The judge in the bankruptcy case that we take the appeals from and this cert is from held that he was bound by the then, he thought in effect, bankruptcy appellate panel decision in Madrid, the 1981 or '2 case, and he felt that controlled him.</text>

            <text syncTime="1201.072" offset="4957982">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.658" offset="4984313">The issue in this case is whether a bankruptcy court may invalidate a real property foreclosure sale that was properly conducted under State law and held before the bankruptcy proceeding began on the theory that the consideration received at that sale was not a reasonably equivalent value for purposes of section 548.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.770" offset="5056829">I would like to focus here on two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.989" offset="5065606">First, that the language of the statute, taken in context, does not require the result petitioner seeks, and second, that a rule permitting invalidation of such a sale is inconsistent with the principles this Court has articulated for construing the Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.065" offset="5117956">First, the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.465" offset="5123598">The key statutory phrase is the reference to reasonably equivalent value in section 548, and in our view the key consideration in interpreting that phrase is the difference between that phrase and the phrases that Congress used in other places where it confronted valuation questions in the Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.793" offset="5192875">Most commonly, it used the unqualified term, value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.228" offset="5206563">In several places it referred to fair market value.</text>

            <text syncTime="1266.264" offset="5218788">Well, Mr. Mann, I think, you know, it's pretty easy to conclude that reasonably equivalent value means something other than market value, but does it also mean, we accept as a per se rule that a foreclosure sale yields reasonably equivalent value, or is it a case... is it open to a case-by-case inquiry, or is it only a presumption?</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.331" offset="5318994">The cases are all over the ball park in how to deal with this.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ronald J. Mann</label>
            <text syncTime="1295.699" offset="5336444">Yes, they are, Justice O'Connor, and I think the way to go about it is to try and ascertain why Congress would have chosen the particular words that they used and then look at them through the lens that the Court has used for evaluating other similar problems the Court has faced under the Bankruptcy Code where you could interpret language in a way that would disrupt systems that the States have carefully put together for dealing with difficult policy questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.565" offset="5431948">When Congress said the value needed only to be reasonably equivalent, as you noted, it must mean that it could be something less than market value, but it seems to me that it also must have meant that the set of considerations that are relevant are going to be different than the ones that would have been relevant if you were just trying to ascertain fair market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.293" offset="5498821">Along those lines, it seems to me you have to realize that the question of value is not an objective, perfect question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.463" offset="5531526">Everyone talks about how, well, he should just bid 70 percent of the fair market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.934" offset="5549394">A person bidding at a foreclosure sale can't know exactly what the value will be determined by a judge several years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.505" offset="5571755">He's going to bid the amount that he believes the property is worth to him, and then the bankruptcy judge task later is to determine... try to recreate a market transaction and to ascertain what would have happened if the property had been sold in a market transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.562" offset="5627970">In our view, when the property, as it has at a foreclosure sale, has already been sold at a market transaction, there's no reason to believe, absent Congress telling us that the Court should do that, that Congress intended for the judge to attempt to do a better job of pricing the property than the market.</text>

            <text syncTime="1963.238" offset="8006681">When you impose a fiduciary duty, people are subject to suit, people may not wish to undertake the duty, and therefore you may have less competent people performing the sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="2030.311" offset="8274906">Well, I think if you take a step back and look at section 548 as a whole it becomes clear what's going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.881" offset="8293192">Section 548 is designed to recover fraudulent conveyances, and the reason that we're worried about fraudulent conveyances is that when borrowers become insolvent, they don't have any incentive to seek a reasonably equivalent value for their property because it's all going to go to their creditors anyway, and so Congress passed a statute, like the overwhelming majority of the States, that would allow a representative of the creditors to recover the property if it was transferred for less than a reasonably equivalent value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.295" offset="8386919">Now, in order to do that, someone is going to have to look and determine what the actual value of the property is, because you can't tell if you didn't get enough until you determine what the value is, and if the property has been transferred in a voluntary sale such as the one to which Justice O'Connor referred, the only way that the judge can evaluate the sale is by attempting to recreate a market transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.909" offset="8473332">But if the transaction that has already occurred was one in which anyone who wished to purchase the property was free to show up and purchase it and the highest bidder purchased the property, it would seem unlikely that a judge would be systemically placed to make a better determination of value after the fact than the market made at the time, and I think if you take that point and add to it the point that this is area in which the States have traditionally been responsible for, the Court has been reluctant to interfere with the--</text>

            <text syncTime="2135.747" offset="8696731">So the notion of the Seventh Circuit at least was that the Bankruptcy Code provisions must be interpreted in light of what is a driving force of the Bankruptcy Code, which is different from the driving force of the State law provisions dealing with foreclosure.</text>

            <text syncTime="2156.826" offset="8781054">The first point is not necessarily in response to your question, but I want to mention the Seventh Circuit rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.980" offset="8801639">It may seem initially attractive to have some sort of rebuttable presumption to allow things to be considered, but from our view the real problem with such rule is that it doesn't really do much better than a 70 percent rule, because it leads people who would wish to purchase at a foreclosure sale in the predicament of not knowing for sure that they actually are purchasing anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.424" offset="8871438">With respect to your question, I think that the purpose of section 548, as I was trying to explain to Justice Souter, it really hinges on the notion that the debtor doesn't have any incentive to secure an appropriate value for the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.834" offset="8921071">When it's sold by a foreclosure sale, the debtor is not in a position to be attempting to dissipate the assets of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.570" offset="8948029">He has no choice in the matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2200.636" offset="8956284">And moreover, at least in this case, and I think that under State law it's generally true, although it's not that clear, the sale is conducted by a third party who is charged under State law with a fiduciary duty to obtain the highest possible price for the property, and I think in those circumstance it's quite difficult to see that there really is a separate bankruptcy policy to which the State has not attended.</text>

            <text syncTime="2989.583" offset="12111980">The California law recognizes that we don't get the best price at a foreclosure sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.987" offset="12137685">They recognize it in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.772" offset="12144790">First, if you use the private power of sale that people use for the most part, you can't get a deficiency judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.057" offset="12165897">If, to get a deficiency judgment, you resort to the judicial foreclosure, then to get a deficiency judgment you have to have a hearing on the fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.746" offset="12196721">You have to have a hearing on price and values.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.282" offset="12206857">Now, mention was made about mortgagees and trust deed holders, and California law, we use mortgages occasionally, but generally deeds of trust, and there we have a third-party trustee who does have fiduciary duties to trustor and beneficiaries of the trust deed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.009" offset="12285747">In the mortgage States, where they don't use trust deeds, I doubt that that is present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.980" offset="12301629">I doubt that requirement's there at all in some of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.932" offset="12313437">A flat out, conclusive presumption will prevent questioning the reasonably equivalent value in a case where there's 2 or 3 percent bid at a sale, and there are sales that happen like that, and certainly we should leave the door open to question those sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.775" offset="12376757">Now, to review what the circuits have done, we have circuit courts in five circuits that have definitely decided that there's no conclusive presumption.</text>

            <text syncTime="3172.196" offset="12842468">Now, we have one case I cited in the brief, and I forget the name of it, where someone failed to get a markup.</text>

            <text syncTime="3191.758" offset="12920731">So we can have situations where we could set aside sales that are liquidation sales, or sales that are... that are below retail value but above wholesale value.</text>
