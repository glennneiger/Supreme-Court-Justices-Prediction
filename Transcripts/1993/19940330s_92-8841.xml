            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="8.677" offset="125683">This case concerns the retroactivity of the Court's 1991 decision in County of Riverside against Mclaughlin.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.637" offset="165493">When a person is arrested without a warrant, the Fourth Amendment protects him against unreasonable seizures post for a prompt judicial determination whether probable cause exists for continuing the person in detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.627" offset="233412">As a rule, Mclaughlin held prompt means within 48 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.163" offset="259639">The petitioner in this case, Kitrich Powell, charged in late 1989 with the murder of his girlfriend's four-year-old daughter, was detained by Nevada police for four days before a magistrate confirmed the existence of probable cause to jail him pending prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.167" offset="351590">The Nevada Supreme Court in 1992 held that the 48-hour rule prescribed in Mclaughlin was inapplicable in Powell's case because our 1991 decision issued many months after Powell's 1989 arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.409" offset="424628">In so ruling, the Nevada Supreme Court overlooked Grifitth v. Kentucky, a 1987 decision, in which we declared a rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or federal, not yet final when the rule is announced.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.851" offset="518355">We, therefore, vacate the Nevada Supreme Court's judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.641" offset="533506">Our decision does not mean Powell will succeed in overturning his conviction where several questions remain open on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.323" offset="572272">Most prominently, the Nevada Supreme Court has yet to consider closely the appropriate remedy for a delay in determining probable cause for detention pending prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.219" offset="623785">That issue is one this Court did not address in Mclaughlin.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.543" offset="645101">Justice Thomas joined by the Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
