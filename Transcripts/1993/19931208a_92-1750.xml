            <text syncTime="61.343" offset="389787">The application of the dual standard for the award of attorney's fees to petitioner Fogerty in this case results in a perversion of the policies of the Copyright Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.200" offset="437225">The Ninth Circuit standard is based upon an implicit assumption about the nature of the parties to a Copyright Act, to wit, that the plaintiff is a copyright author who is seeking to sue a business enterprise that has copied his work, but in this case, we have only one author.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.883" offset="519877">That's John Fogerty.</text>

            <text syncTime="108.192" offset="577137">He applied for his attorney's fees, as was authorized in section 505, and the court denied those fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.455" offset="606185">They denied the fees because he was a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.277" offset="617470">There is no policy in the Copyright Act that justifies the distinction against this author based upon his status as a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.567" offset="662610">What possible policy could there be under the copyright laws that the plaintiff in the case, a copyright owner, had Fantasy won the case, would be awarded its fees, but Fogerty, the author in the case, would not be awarded his fees even though he had done exactly what the copyright laws asked him to do, which is create a new original work?</text>

            <text syncTime="310.013" offset="1384425">I believe the first Civil Rights Act was a '64 act, and then this Court had its Alyeska decision, and then there was the '76 Civil Rights Attorney's Fee Act that Congress enacted in response to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.425" offset="1442104">It's only in the very recent past that there's been any suggestion from even the courts that have the dual standard, and I think they're just make-weight, drawing an analogy to the civil rights statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="383.982" offset="1680341">You also had the statute case, Community of Non-Violence v. Reid, which was a declaratory relief action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2785.445" offset="11286192">1988, which also has the same language, and also gets construed exactly the way the Ninth Circuit construed section 505 for prevailing defendants... 1988 is the attorney's fee provision that allows 1983 prevailing plaintiffs to get their attorney's fees, and as Your Honor knows, 1983 has been the engine for recovery for a number of plaintiffs who don't look anything like the typical civil rights individual struggling against the wealthy corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.153" offset="11392981">Golden State, you know, the Virginia Hospital Association, these are wealthy corporate plaintiffs who had the wherewithal to bring that lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.342" offset="11437807">They won it under 1988... 1983, and in some cases have gotten their attorney's fees, and I don't think that the metaphor translates very well, nor do I think that 505 should be specially carved out for one type of plaintiff, another type of defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.973" offset="11504262">The statute I think deserves the kind of categorical construction that the analogies in similarly worded fee-shifting provisions warrant.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth I. Sidle</label>
            <text syncTime="2853.310" offset="11557656">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.411" offset="11569986">I would like to respond to a couple of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.244" offset="11577405">The Zipes case is somewhat difficult to conceptualize as a copyright case, but if we did, I think it would be fairly easy to see that that's a good case that illustrates what the rule should be in copyright cases versus what the rule is in civil rights cases, and I submit that because there's a dual standard in civil rights cases, this Court had its problems in Zipes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.729" offset="11667266">If you had had an even-handed standard, it wouldn't have been that difficult, but if we have an intervenor, let's say, in a copyright case that comes in and says, hey, but I have a copyright, and that keeps the plaintiff from bringing this case, and the plaintiff prevails against that, on an even-handed standard he would get his fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.490" offset="11734349">The problem in Zipes was, you in effect had two people that were in the category of the favored plaintiff in a civil rights case, and maybe Justice Blackmun's dissent was correct that the defendant TWA should have won the costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.647" offset="11778966">That at least would have been consistent with the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.448" offset="11786176">But I think that the Zipes case is a strong argument for why, in the copyright area, where you just have businesses fighting over control of literary properties, that there should be an even-handed standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.185" offset="11829121">Now, opposing counsel says that from the patent area we have the law applied that was applied to the defendant in this case, and that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.542" offset="11862558">The only difference is that in the patent law it expressly says that it will only be under exceptional circumstances that fees are awarded, whereas in the copyright law, it just says the court may, without any requirement of exceptional circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="2947.381" offset="11933924">It's even-handed, and that's what we're asking for, is an even-handed standard, and I think Justice Ginsburg's point is well-taken, that Congress decided to change the patent law to make it only exceptional circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.219" offset="11981258">It did not make that decision when it passed the 1976 Copyright Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.032" offset="11996514">It did not put exceptional circumstances--</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="2965.183" offset="12005082">No, but they argued it had been so construed up until... I mean, even before the language went in the statute.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth I. Sidle</label>
            <text syncTime="2969.326" offset="12021696">--But that, I submit, is... and I also submit, despite the analogy of patent law being closer to copyright than civil rights cases, I think there are also some unique considerations in copyright cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.933" offset="12068089">The simple fact is that prior to 1976, the cases were all over the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.657" offset="12083031">You couldn't say that there was certainly any dual standard that was clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.399" offset="12101944">I would point out, the Senate report on the Civil Rights Attorney's Fee Award Act in 1976, which we cite in footnote 16 of our reply brief, the Senate report goes on and recites the history of the '64 Civil Rights Act, the Alyeska case, and then the dual standard, and then it goes on to say that there are other statutes where a similar dual standard has been interpreted by the courts, and it cites the Water Pollution Control Act and the Marine Protection Act as other places where there's a dual standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.541" offset="12234541">It doesn't mention the Copyright Act, and that was enacted the same year as the Copyright Act, so I don't see how you can imply that Congress had in mind that there was a dual standard that they were ratifying by enacting the 1976 Copyright Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.741" offset="12291384">There is an argument that defendants have sufficient incentives to litigate cases, and an example is given that Fogerty defended this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.249" offset="12333389">Well, I dare say that plaintiffs have a sufficient interest to litigate cases whether they get preferential treatment in attorney's fees or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.372" offset="12365885">Typically, plaintiffs in copyright cases are trying to reap a substantial reward that the defendant is reaping.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.008" offset="12400471">If there's any common denominator in copyright cases, it is that the defendant has been successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.492" offset="12422309">Plaintiffs don't bother suing an unsuccessful writer, or author, or songwriter, and they are looking at their pot of gold, and you can make the same... just turn the mirror around and say the same things to plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.162" offset="12477062">Congress has seen fit in certain circumstances to put its thumb on the scales.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.256" offset="12501408">In the copyright laws we have statutory damage provisions, which they say to plaintiffs, well, maybe there's not enough money here to bring a suit, so we'll specifically enact statutory damages that you can enact, and that gives a further incentive to the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.764" offset="12563475">So here we have Congress saying we're going to put the thumb on the scales here, and maybe there's other provisions where we extend the duration of copyright, and we do various things to favor copyright owners, but when it comes to attorney's fees, it doesn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.434" offset="12614153">It doesn't put its thumb on the scales, it simply says the court may award to the prevailing party, and that's what the court should require be done in this case.</text>
