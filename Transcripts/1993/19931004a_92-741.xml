            <text syncTime="11.710" offset="200269">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.732" offset="212286">This case arises out of the financial failure of a large California savings and loan institution in the early 1980's.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.365" offset="242901">The bank had been suffering very serious financial losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.378" offset="262963">It's net worth had gone down from about $100 million to about $15 million in the several months preceding the seizure of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.825" offset="292743">In the week preceding the seizure, depositors removed about $70 million from the bank's deposits.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.718" offset="320328">The bank was seized by the California Savings and Loan Commissioner because she thought the bank was operating in an unsafe manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.204" offset="350212">She appointed the F-S-L-I-C... FSLIC, which has since been replaced by FDIC... as the receiver, and FSLIC was also appointed receiver under Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.850" offset="392844">Under FSLIC's policy then, which is still FDIC's policy, when a thrift institution fails for financial reasons, they immediately terminate all the top management of the bank, for obvious reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.798" offset="448642">That's the management that got the bank into the financial condition that required the seizure, those are the highest paid people, but perhaps most importantly, the receiver's job is either to terminate the bank, or to merge it with another going institution, and for the purposes of doing that, it's very important not to have the top management there, because the institution into which it's merged will have its own management.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.866" offset="548847">Pursuant to that policy, the four top officers of Fidelity were terminated... the president, the plaintiff in this case, Mr. Meyer, who is the president's brother, and two other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.414" offset="599107">The bank was... what happens is, the bank is terminated... the receiver takes over at the end of one day, and at the beginning of the next day the bank reopens as a new institution which is chartered by the Federal Home Bank Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.702" offset="652188">Six months later, that new institution merged the bank into Citibank, I think, in California, and it continues to exist in that form.</text>

            <text syncTime="151.390" offset="758976">The only ones which proceeded to trial were claims not of a breach of contract but claims under the due process clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="233.863" offset="1088851">The suit that he has recovered on, a jury... the two suits that went to the jury were a claim against FDIC for the deprivation of his property without due process, and a claim against the receiver for deprivation of his property, his contract right, without due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.834" offset="1144753">The jury found for the receiver on the ground that he had qualified immunity, but the jury found for the plaintiff against FDIC in the amount of $130,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="3302.875" offset="13364939">I think the Court could look at those actions and could say it was clearly the purpose of Congress to include within the Federal Tort Claims Act those actions that are common law torts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.161" offset="13410078">That's the meaning of that last phrase, so that if there is a common law tort that is not... that is accepted either implicitly or plicitly by the Federal Tort Claims Act, then that still would be cognizable, but here we're talking about constitutional torts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3385.669" offset="13696067">--Yes, I am, and it's my position that the logic of the Bivens action, namely, that this Court has the primary duty to enforce constitutionally protected rights, and that it should not be surprising that Article III courts, in protecting constitutionally protected rights would turn to traditional judicial remedies like damages to do that, applies with equal logic to a sue-and-be-sued agency, and that sue-and-be-sued agency has a waiver of sovereign immunity by Congress, so I believe that... I believe that your logic in Bivens makes perfect sense for a sue-and-be-sued agency, and there has been a waiver of sovereign immunity.</text>
