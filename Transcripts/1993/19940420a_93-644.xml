            <text syncTime="12.409" offset="204636">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of Oregon to decide whether a defendant in a civil case has a right to any judicial review of a jury verdict alleged to be excessive under applicable State or Federal substantive damages law, or indeed, a plaintiff claiming that a verdict is insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.981" offset="278823">In the Texaco Pennzoil case a punitive verdict of $3 billion was returned by the jury, and it was reduced on judicial review by $2 billion.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.639" offset="325530">In Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Company, a $125 million punitive verdict was reduced to three and a half million dollars.</text>

            <text syncTime="70.669" offset="437648">The standards may vary.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.409" offset="452590">They are a matter of the State substantive law of damages, the State substantive law of punitive damages, which will set up a structure for determining the amount of damages not in any liquidated or definite sense, but in some general sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="108.042" offset="587068">The only point that I wanted to make is that if those verdicts had been returned in Oregon, the Court would have lacked the power to consider whether they conform to the law of Oregon.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="126.164" offset="659584">Well, I think it's very important in understanding this question to distinguish between the procedural due process requirement... that is, what procedures must be provided, which is what we're talking about this morning, and the substantive law of damages, which is to say, what law determines how much is an acceptable range of damages on a given set of facts?</text>
            <text syncTime="146.978" offset="742863">We are not saying in this case that the State of Oregon, or that the other States in those cases, have to have any particular substantive law of damages.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="159.997" stopTime="167.992">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="159.997" offset="794899">Mr. Frey, would it be sufficient for a State to say, as long as the award is not the product of passion or prejudice, it is not excessive?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="167.992" stopTime="205.509">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="167.992" offset="826872">I doubt that.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.894" offset="838575">The question... if you're asking for passion or prejudice... if you are saying to me... I guess I want to give a two-part answer to that question, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.180" offset="875669">The first is, passion or prejudice means different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.293" offset="888103">In our view, the term is ordinarily used as a rubric for actually conducting excessiveness review, but it could be the reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.087" offset="919346">That is, you could look at the size of the verdict and say it's a product of passion and prejudice, or you could say, we will not look at the size of the verdict at all, but if we see other evidence, such as an improper jury argument or some other extraneous evidence that might cause passion and prejudice.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="205.509" stopTime="229.514">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="205.509" offset="977024">The thing about punitive damages review, it seems to me, is that if you're reviewing a verdict for actual damages and talk about passion or prejudice or the weight of it, you've got some fairly concrete things to hang on to... the amount of the medicals, the amount of... cost of maintaining someone who's disabled... but the punitive damage is much, much harder to pin down.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="229.514" stopTime="287.903">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="229.514" offset="1073050">Well, it may be much harder to pin down, and that suggests that there is a difference between liquidated kinds of damages inquiry and the kind of unliquidated inquiry where you're asking how much pain and suffering the plaintiff experienced as a result of his or her injury, or how much is an appropriate amount of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.486" offset="1148910">But State law says, for example, deterrence is relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.389" offset="1164479">State law may say comparative review is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.062" offset="1179212">That is, the verdict should not be disproportionate to other verdicts that have been returned in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.414" offset="1196557">Now, I'm not saying the Federal Constitution requires the State to have such a rule, but I am saying, if the State does have such a rule, we have a right to have that rule applied to the verdict in the case by a judge to determine whether the verdict comports with the State's substantive law of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.605" offset="1261341">The State's substantive law of damages may be that damages are disfavored and should be small in product liability cases, because they affect the... punitive damages, let's say, because they affect the cost of goods to consumers.</text>

            <text syncTime="292.484" offset="1324871">What are the procedural limits?</text>
            <text syncTime="297.169" offset="1343679">You have not answered whether passion and prejudice... maybe you want to continue that.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.722" offset="1365831">I would be interested in knowing whether you think a remittitur device is constitutionally required, whether you think it's compatible with due process to have a new trial limited to the punitive damages only, or whether you'd have to have an entire trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.312" offset="1428211">What exactly are the components of this due process for which you're arguing?</text>

            <text syncTime="330.072" offset="1475232">I think passion and prejudice is not enough, because even a well meaning jury not inflamed by passion and prejudice can make a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.705" offset="1501772">They can misunderstand the legal constraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.427" offset="1512639">They can come up in good faith with an aberrant verdict which violates the State law, substantive law of damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="359.451" offset="1592783">That is, the Supreme Court would not be asked that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.243" offset="1603963">The State supreme court... there is a State law of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.004" offset="1619010">If you had... imagine a bench trial in which the judge has to determine the amount of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.520" offset="1641057">State law, which may not be very articulated or detailed in the form of a code, but it exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.006" offset="1663000">There are principles that guide his or her selection of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.847" offset="1678360">For instance, to take compensatory damages for pain and suffering, the amount is supposed to be the amount that would appropriately compensate the plaintiff for injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.253" offset="1707930">Now, I understand that there is a range within which reasonable people could disagree, and it may be a very substantial range, and any verdict that is within that range by a jury, or any judgment returned by a judge within that range, is acceptable, but... and therefore not subject to being set aside.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="1586.099" offset="6499310">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.581" offset="6517282">I think I might begin with, I think a crucial question that Justice Kennedy has been pressing, because I was rather surprised by the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.716" offset="6549779">It seems to us that really no argument whatever has been offered by Honda, either historical or functional, for the peculiar thing they say they have a right to as a matter of procedural due process, namely, review by a judge after the verdict... and I underline the phrase, after the verdict... to assure compliance with State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.431" offset="6636714">Now, apart from the proposition which I think has been explored by Justice Souter and Justice Scalia of how circular their claim is... I mean, State law doesn't give them what they say they have a right to... and apart from the decisions of this Court, summarized in a footnote in our brief, holding that there is no Federal right to make sure you get everything the State promises, outside the very limited context of Cleveland v. Loudermill and entitlement theory, apart from that, the fact is that Oregon has precisely the procedure about which Justice Kennedy asked, and it's not that different from Federal practice, although it's in a damages context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.975" offset="6778820">The leading case, indeed, their brief reads as though this Court granted cert to review it 44 years out of time, is Van Lom, in Oregon, in 1949, and Van Lom very carefully, at page 467 of 210 Pacific 2nd, reviews a series of cases... Lyons, McDaniels, Weatherspoon, British Empire... all explicitly holding that it is legal error, reversible notwithstanding Article VII, section 3, which just prevents reexamination of a jury verdict based on evidence, legal error for a judge not to cap the damages at the highest level the judge believes would be sustainable under the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.574" offset="6965230">That, in a sense, disposes of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3314.467" offset="13412773">There is no such procedure in Oregon for unliquidated damages, and somebody asked whether it would be fair for this Court to saddle the Oregon courts with such a procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.414" offset="13456659">If the Oregon courts chose to have such a procedure and gave people notice that it was available, that might satisfy the Constitution, but you could not affirm this decision on the ground that such a procedure exists in Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.205" offset="13511725">It's up to the Oregon courts to decide how they are going to comply with the requirement that there be some judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.997" offset="13534921">So you would have to say there has to be some, we send it back, and then the Oregon courts would craft something which may or may not be procedurally adequate to assure fundamental fairness.</text>
