            <text syncTime="644.244" offset="2726183">It is a very different proposition, states raise and lower taxes on different taxpayers and different items of property, as does the Federal Government, for a host of reasons, drawing distinctions between types of property and owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.892" offset="2784802">But when governments exempt you are usually dealing with a very powerful policy choice on a government's part that suggests that perhaps a very different policy is at work, and that is exactly the kind of policy choice that drove the wording of the comparison class and caused it to be limited to property subject to a property tax levy.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.816" offset="2872469">So it is not the illogical result in any sense to say that if we want to equalize railroad property and insure that they are not taxed higher than some average, we will look to some comparison that consists of taxed property.</text>

            <text syncTime="1335.106" offset="5489625">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.740" offset="5512195">Under the state's reading of the statute the 4R Act would literally prohibit every imaginable form of state tax discrimination other than discriminatory property tax exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.070" offset="5569455">If there is an eye in this needle it would be large enough to drive the entire camel through.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.805" offset="5600384">The state, instead of simply preferentially taxing non-railroad property, could not tax it at all, exempting it entirely from the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.241" offset="5642180">The courts of appeals have unanimously concluded that that interpretation of the act is not sensible and doesn't respond to either its language or its history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.090" offset="5689514">In the view of the courts of appeals subsection (b)(4) prohibits a discriminatory tax by any means other than those already prohibited in the prior subsections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.829" offset="5748551">This is, after all, national legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.151" offset="5761821">For example, Ohio could enact a tax that discriminates by assessment rates and that tax would violate (b)(1) and (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.997" offset="5797243">Oklahoma could enact a tax that discriminates by tax rates and that tax would violate (b)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.361" offset="5826605">If Oregon enacts a tax that has discriminatory exemptions that tax in the language of the statute is another tax that results in discrimination against railroads.</text>

            <text syncTime="1460.357" offset="5990654">Lehnhausen built upon what I think we can call the pigeon hole rule, which was adopted in an opinion by Justice Frankfurter in 1940 in the Chesapeake and, I'm sorry, in the Nashville and Chattanooga case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.570" offset="6055437">Putting those two rules together, what this Court has held is that the Constitution doesn't bar the states from treating railroad property differently from all other kinds of property.</text>

            <text syncTime="2022.807" offset="8240423">In our view Oregon unquestionably treats the railroad property worse than it treats the majority of the other property within the state, and accordingly respondents urge the Court to hold that Oregon imposes a tax that results in discriminatory treatment against rail carriers as that language appeared in the original version of what is now 49 U.S.C. section 11503(b)(4), and therefore the tax is unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.802" offset="8340420">In turn respondents urge the Court to hold that the only appropriate remedy for that situation is to enjoin the state from imposing that personal property tax and thereby treat the railroad property just as it treats the majority of other property within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.943" offset="8401024">In doing that there are essentially three issues in this case, although at this stage you might have lost sight of a couple of them because the state for its part focuses almost exclusively on the threshold question of whether or not (b)(4) applies to anything at all, almost in some respects, but certainly it raises the question of whether (b)(4) applies to ad valorem taxes and whether it challenges its exemption practices in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2832.156" offset="11477831">I have two thoughts about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.396" offset="11482742">First of all, the use of the term discriminate in the preamble talks about discriminating against interstate commerce, whereas the term discriminate in subsection (b)(4) talks about discrimination against rail carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.453" offset="11527045">So I'm not sure that it's fair to infer that those necessarily reincorporate each other, and it's an odd phraseology.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.267" offset="11554317">And again, I think if you take the (b)(1) through (b)(3) and too narrow constrain them, what you do is violence to the language differences between (b)(1) and (b)(3), and (b)(4).</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.104" offset="11593605">The specific exemptions provide that they are taking out exemptions for making assessment ratio decisions, and they are taking out exemptions from trying to make rate judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.882" offset="11636760">That makes perfect sense if anybody has ever tried to do a ratio assessment, an assessment ratio analysis, because it's very hard to figure out how you're going to assess property that has never been taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.059" offset="11677406">So it makes perfect sense to take it out of that context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.531" offset="11687333">It's a much more streamlined and sensible way of implementing the tax scheme, but that's not a reason then to go and take away from (b)(4) the language that every court of appeals has embraced and said is a catch-all prohibition against all forms of discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="3138.405" offset="12702869">Under those provisions it is never available to the railroad to argue that the differentials in rates for personal property should be compared to real property as a basis for seeking some kind of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.721" offset="12744038">And it seems to us if you don't compare it for (b)(3) there is really no reason to compare it for (b)(4).</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.416" offset="12762846">Second of all, it is wholly arbitrary to decide that you're going to make a comparison with respect to real property but then you're going to exclude all intangible personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.451" offset="12802970">And the stipulation in this case is that there is $60 billion worth of intangible personal property in the State of Oregon, all of which is exempt, so that if you were to include that into the mix you would end up with something akin, under the state's reply brief analysis of all the property things, you'd end up with an 89 percent exemption of property while we're getting taxed fully.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.403" offset="12882800">Under those circumstances it seems clear to us that would be invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.435" offset="12894921">But we have never argued, none of the railroads nor the carlines have ever insisted on that kind of a comparison.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.290" offset="12914356">What we ask for is to be treated like the property holders who are most comparable to us, business and commercial industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.225" offset="12942151">That is all we have asked for, and it seems reasonable to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.797" offset="12952391">One last observation I would make with respect to the Government's justifications argument, it seems to me clear that justifications are not provided for for (b)(1) and (b)(3), and no reason appears under our theory of a majority rule to have justifications applied for (b)(4).</text>

            <text syncTime="3282.350" offset="13278608">Railroad property is subject to the same set of exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.012" offset="13293236">If railroads own timberland they receive the same tax treatment as any other taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.678" offset="13319881">As a result of that, that is true with respect to any exemption, business inventory as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.528" offset="13343287">The point of that is that in fact there is extraordinary uniformity in the State of Oregon in its taxing scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.335" offset="13374529">Railroads and carlines are in the host of a great number of population that consists of a large number of taxpayers, a large number of taxed property, and they are in very good company in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.933" offset="13428969">They receive exactly the same average tax rate and assessment of every other taxpayer in the State of Oregon.</text>

            <text syncTime="3335.974" offset="13493125">Beyond that our only other point is the point we began with with this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.807" offset="13520397">When Congress crafted subsections (1) through (3) and defined the comparison class it was not simply declining to deal with exempt property as the United States' Solicitor suggests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.236" offset="13566164">It was defining discrimination in the process of doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.898" offset="13580792">And the express policy choice plain in the text of the statute was that states may exempt property from their taxation schemes without penalty to railroads in the form of lower taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.527" offset="13631261">That same express policy runs directly to timberland and agricultural land as to, you can no more put exempt property back in the calculus and be true to that policy choice than you can put timberland or agricultural land back in the formula as well.</text>
