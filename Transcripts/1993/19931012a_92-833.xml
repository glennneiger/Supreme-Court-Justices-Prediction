            <text syncTime="233.064" offset="1078076">The charge... the invocation of criminal process; the bringing to bear of the most severe power possessed by government against an individual; the requirement that the individual at that point do whatever is necessary, whether it be the posting of bond with the State, whether it be the securing of counsel, whether it be the procuring of investigative services, whether it be whatever else is necessary in order to defend not just his reputation but his very liberty, his very ability to lead his life as he has chosen to lead his life; that is what is at stake at that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="292.584" offset="1316209">And what troubles me about the case you're bringing is you start out with a potential Fourth Amendment claim, an analogy to the common law false arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.243" offset="1370857">That's what the police officer does and that's what he's responsible for.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.684" offset="1384650">And then you're shifting over to substantive due process because you missed out on what you conceive to be the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.593" offset="1428222">The Fourth Amendment governs the police officer's conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.614" offset="1444313">It says thou shalt not seize unreasonably without probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.569" offset="1464166">Why isn't that the rubric under which this case should be treated?</text>
            <text syncTime="335.700" offset="1488721">Why should we suddenly get into a new territory simply because the action was started arguably too late?</text>

            <label>Mr. John H. Bisbee</label>
            <text syncTime="343.387" offset="1519441">Justice Ginsburg, it is altogether correct, as you state, that the police officer's original and customary duty is to make the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.763" offset="1556953">You're also absolutely correct that the criteria in the Fourth Amendment governing reasonable searches and seizures govern his actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.359" offset="1599272">But with all respect, Justice Ginsburg, your statement is incomplete in that in most jurisdictions, including Illinois, a police officer plays a substantial role in the institution of the criminal charge itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.469" offset="1659771">And it did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.071" offset="1666145">And most often, Your Honor, the police officer is the one, because of the burdens placed upon the prosecutor's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.227" offset="1694775">As the Court enunciated so clearly in Imbler v. Pachtman, 10, 15 years, it is the police officer who is the one who is privy to and has knowledge of the investigative sources, the people who are able to give him information as to when crimes are--</text>

            <text syncTime="406.879" offset="1773352">He made an arrest and then the person technically is in arrest status until the criminal case is over.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.384" offset="1807415">He's released on bond, but he is technically arrested for the duration of that procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.969" offset="1833747">So why does the police officer's participation shift from the arrest... initial arrest, and then whatever statements he makes thereafter is consistent with maintaining the arrest, rather than shifting the police officer from the role of police officer to the role of prosecutor?</text>

            <text syncTime="448.176" offset="1938550">The officer did far more than simply create the impetus for the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.569" offset="1960179">He attested to the charging document itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.770" offset="1968956">He attested to the facts that he asserted, that Kevin Albright had sold controlled substances to someone named Veda Moore.</text>

            <text syncTime="484.748" offset="2084836">And certainly a police officer who participates, particularly as materially as Detective Oliver did, in the attestation to the criminal charge, has begun an action the natural consequence of which, the inevitable consequence of which is going to be the criminal prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1507.680" offset="6176552">First, that the Court should not expand the concepts of fundamental liberties and substantive due process in order to reach a claim that an individual was charged with a crime without probable cause so long, of course, as that individual was not incarcerated pending disposition of the charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.320" offset="6239141">Secondly, to the extent that there might be some intrusion on a liberty interest, the focus for purposes of due process should be on whether the State provides adequate procedures in order to protect against the risk of an arbitrary deprivation of that interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.112" offset="6302357">And in this case I would point out that the petitioner concedes he advances no challenge to Illinois' procedures for processing and filing of criminal charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.556" offset="6332137">Finally, in the event that the Court determines that there would be a fundamental right which could potentially be implicated under the circumstances of this case, we would submit that principles of substantive due process should not be implicated unless a petitioner or a plaintiff alleges facts which are sufficient to support an inference of malice or improper purpose or some other form of intentional or egregious misconduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="2528.479" offset="10259804">As a result of that, under the petitioner's probable cause standard it is conceivable that virtually every criminal defendant, after acquitted, could turn around and sue in Federal court claiming that the evidence was insufficient to support the charges against me.</text>

            <text syncTime="2634.286" offset="10682987">But, again, we know from cases in the grand jury context such, as the United States v. Williams, that that's not the case.</text>
