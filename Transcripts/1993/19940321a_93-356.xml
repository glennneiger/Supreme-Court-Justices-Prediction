            <text syncTime="941.752" offset="3918363">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="953.319" offset="3964652">I'd like to start, if I could, with the text of 203(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="958.042" offset="3983564">I think it's clear that, as a practical matter, what the Commission has done here is not to eliminate the tariff filing requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.577" offset="4009687">We think that's also true as a textual matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.219" offset="4024211">What the Commission has done here is to make the requirement conditional.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.461" offset="4041243">In theory, this requirement continues to exist and operate for every carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.135" offset="4067888">The question is whether the carrier meets the conditions that trigger the requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.118" offset="4087845">It seems to us it is as much a modification of a requirement to change the conditions that trigger it as to change the obligations that are, in fact, triggered.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.635" offset="4125879">The Commission has done no more than that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.256" offset="4136328">Additionally, we think that section 203(c), in fact in particular the first sentence of 203(c), makes clear that the Commission has the power to remove the tariff obligation entirely, because it says that service must be provided under tariff unless otherwise provided by or under the authority of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.132" offset="4231832">Plainly, section 203(b)(2), in our view, which is the very preceding sentence in the Act, is authority conferred in the Act to remove the tariff filing obligation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1141.751" offset="4718337">But it seems to us that the logic must be that if the Commission has the authority to remove it in some circumstances, therefore the necessary implication is that it's not in those circumstances indispensable to the functioning of title II if the logic that would allow the Commission to take that step exists with respect to 10 carriers and also exists with respect to a hundred or four hundred carriers, that there's no natural stopping place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.030" offset="4827424">That if the logic works for that... for the small number of carriers and the logic works equally well for the large number of carriers, the Commission ought to have the discretion to expand that power to include a large number of carriers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1245.510" offset="5133370">What I take to be AT&amp;T's central argument is that title II of the Act cannot be enforced absent tariff filings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.685" offset="5162105">We think that that is simply wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.126" offset="5171822">Although tariff filing is one method of enforcing an antidiscrimination provision, it is clearly not the only method.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.471" offset="5197213">The Commission has made a decision here, in its discretion, that it wants to use the complaint process as the statutory... as the principal enforcement method.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.497" offset="5233367">That is a decision that is owed substantial deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.038" offset="5243502">It's a reasonable policy decision, particularly given AT&amp;T's concession that nondominant carriers can't charge unreasonable or discriminatory rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.554" offset="5277566">Indeed, many non... many price discrimination statutes, the antitrust laws, the Robinson-Patman Act, State unfair competition laws, are routinely enforced without any requirement of published rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.809" offset="5318630">The logic that allows those statutes to function is a logic on which the Commission ought to be entitled to rely here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1297.615" offset="5341827">Well, it's also... those statutes are applied to competitive industries as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.437" offset="5361053">I'm not sure those statutes help you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.690" offset="5374114">I mean, they... those statutes operate on the assumption that the mere presence of competition does not eliminate price discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.794" offset="5398565">Indeed, the price discrimination is a tool that's often used most often in fiercely competitive industries.</text>

            <text syncTime="1317.989" offset="5423329">But they do operate on the assumption, Justice Scalia, that the very existence of competitors is likely to ferret out the price discrimination, and that competitors have an incentive to find out what the other competitors are charging, and that customers have an incentive to disclose the best offers they're getting from one competitor in order that another competitor can come in and meet or beat that price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.412" offset="5512981">And therefore it's a matter of disclosure of the rates being offered that counts here, that makes the enforcement mechanism work, and that's the kind of logic the Commission relied on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.630" offset="5553837">In our judgment, that was plainly a reasonable decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.772" offset="5566480">The third point I'd like to make is... if I could, is that it would, in our view, be an unwarranted extension of the filed rate doctrine to apply Maislin here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.528" offset="5601484">In our view, by far more... the case most on point is Permian Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.289" offset="5616531">In Permian Basin this Court faced an analog to the question faced today; does an agency have the statutory authority to remove a tariff obligation, in that case, the tariff obligations of section 4 of the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.969" offset="5671179">In Permian, this Court squarely held that the Federal Power Commission had that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.782" offset="5694480">And it did so in a statute, section 4 of the Federal Power Act, that imposed an unequivocal obligation on every carrier to file all rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.347" offset="5732723">Section 4 of the Natural Gas Act also imposed a nondiscrimination and a reasonable pricing requirement, just as does the Communications Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.705" offset="5766160">In fact, the Natural Gas Act was modeled on the Interstate Commerce Act and was passed in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.988" offset="5787267">Despite all that, this Court concluded that the Federal Power Commission did not exceed its statutory authority in removing that requirement for small producers of natural gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.914" offset="5831048">Now, that exemption from the tariff requirement in Permian Basin, if one goes back and reads the agency decision at 34 Federal Power Commission 235, applied to 2,000 of the 2,100 producers of natural gas who, in the aggregate, produced 15 percent of the natural gas supply.</text>

            <text syncTime="1472.939" offset="6043058">The agency's made a decision that this... that removal of tariffs in this circumstance will advance the public interest, will make this market more efficient and more competitive, and in our view that's a judgment that ought to be respected.</text>

            <text syncTime="1525.503" offset="6253396">The issue in this case is whether Congress has given the FCC the power to exempt a broad and concededly potentially unlimited class of communications common carriers from a statutory requirement that was copied, almost verbatim, from those of the Interstate Commerce Act, and that is utterly central to the statutory scheme for the same reasons this Court identified in the Maislin case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.108" offset="6347750">And we submit that it's very clear from the language of the Act, both 203 looked at in isolation and in context of the Act as a whole, and from its history, that the Communications Act just isn't susceptible to the FCC's interpretation, which was the basis for the court of appeals' decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.641" offset="6413892">But that even if the statutory terms were ambiguous, a century of decisions of this Court, reaffirmed recently in Maislin and the '86 Square D decision, established that exceptions to statutory filed rate requirements can't be inferred from general or ambiguous provisions, and there's no way that section 203(b) is an explicit exemption.</text>

            <text syncTime="2090.034" offset="8511525">And the key thing, as you said in Maislin, is that the rates charged each customer be stated in or ascertainable from the public filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.091" offset="8555724">So if that purpose is being served, I think they can do lots of things to these other requirements, so long as that purpose is served.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.995" offset="8587280">And the example I just gave you, where they allowed things that aren't traditional rate schedules, would be an example of the modification of the requirements of the statute that does modify the requirements of 203 but's consistent with the statute as a whole because it doesn't affect the enforcement of the other provisions that the filing requirement is designed to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.189" offset="8672126">So there's all sorts of things that I could imagine being done in modifying the requirements of 203, but the one thing that can't be done, which is that there can't be any modification of the requirement that the rates and the terms and conditions affecting the rates be filed so that similarly situated customers are in a position where they can know what they are and demand them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2269.160" offset="9228012">But that's just wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.021" offset="9231460">I mean, section 203(c) says that carriers have to charge only filed rates, except as provided... unless otherwise provided by or under the authority of this chapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.108" offset="9283809">It says chapter, not section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.931" offset="9291123">If it were referring to 203(b), it would say section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.171" offset="9304080">And it's argued in the reply that there's no other provision in the statute that authorizes exceptions to the requirement... that... in which the FCC is authorized to create exceptions to the requirement that carriers charge only filed rates, but that's just untrue too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.385" offset="9372939">In our brief, page 20, note 26, we list a number of examples, and in each of them the FCC is delegated authority to enter orders or take other actions that will have the affect of excusing carriers from the obligation that they file... they charge only filed rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.035" offset="9435528">Just to take one of them, the first one we list is 201(b) and 211, which say... 201(b) which is page 1a of our statutory appendix, says that nothing in this chapter will prohibit contracts between carriers for exchanges of service if the FCC enters an order that it's in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.918" offset="9506999">So under this procedure, you file a contract with the FCC, if it approves then you're authorized... the carriers are authorized to swap services with one other and not charge each other filed rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.595" offset="9545765">That's true of each... every other example we list.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.694" offset="9554124">In each of those other provisions, 205, 210, and the newly enacted 332, the FCC is authorized to take specific action that will have the effect of relieving carriers from the requirement that they charge only filed rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.755" offset="9614415">And the fact that Congress enacts these specific exemptions just shows that the modification authority isn't as broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.459" offset="9637194">And if you want contemporaneous evidence that Congress didn't understand the modification authority to include the authority to exempt people from the rate-filing requirements whatsoever, at the same time Congress enacted the Communications Act, or the year... the next year it enacted the Motor Carrier Act, and it has the same filing requirements, same modification provisions applicable both to motor common carriers, that's section 217 of the Act, and motor contract carriers, that's 218.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.046" offset="9751505">And in the contract carrier provision, it has the rate-filing requirement, then it has the modification provision, then after that there's a provision that says:</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.563" offset="9781599">"The ICC is authorized to grant relief from the requirements of this statute. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.105" offset="9799780">That clearly shows that Congress didn't understand the modification authority reaches as broad as they say, because it enacted a specific additional provision authorizing them to grant relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2516.577" offset="10217634">There's no doubt that the existence of competition is an extremely significant fact in this regulatory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.253" offset="10244384">As we have said, in trying to get deregulation for ourself, it justifies modifications of the rate-filing requirements, it justifies elimination of cost-support requirements with the filings, it eliminates... it justifies eliminating active forms of cost-of-service regulation, shortening the notice period to as little as 1 day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.056" offset="10327558">So it's a very significant fact, but the statute says you can modify in particular circumstances, not exempt, and all... all competition allows within... under 203 is the sorts of streamlined regulation that we are seeking in this petition that we filed that people keep misquoting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.197" offset="10396103">So competition is very significant, but it doesn't eliminate the need for the rate-filing requirements for the reasons that I said earlier, because you'll have price differences even in competitive markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.403" offset="10440929">They're not anticompetitive, but they are price differences that Congress sought to eliminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.346" offset="10460782">Congress wanted equal rates for similarly situated customers, and decided the way to achieve that is making everyone file rates so that all customers would know what they were and could demand them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2641.549" offset="10717514">Our point here... and I... our point here is only that whatever the significant of that distinction for other purposes, you can't be... it can't be a basis to exempt carriers from what the statute unambiguously requires that all do, which is to charge only filed rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.939" offset="10783133">As I've said, that we think this case, even if you were to disagree with us that the statute is susceptible to the FCC's interpretation, we think this case is controlled by the decision in Maislin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.228" offset="10840289">Because it establishes, as, you know, many prior cases had, that rate-filing requirements are so central to the statutory scheme that even broad and facially applicable provisions of the law, like the ban on unreasonable practices at issue there, can't be construed to authorize exceptions to the great filing requirement unless Congress has explicitly so provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.891" offset="10922941">I believe today, and certainly in the reply belief, that Mr. Verrilli tried to distinguish Maislin by saying that it didn't involve the requirement that rates be filed, but only a requirement... which is a requirement of section 203(a) of the statute... that involved only a requirement that carriers follow whatever tariffs they've filed and that they not charge rates that are different from those that are set forth in the tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.319" offset="11028580">And they say there's a fundamental distinction in the statute between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.912" offset="11042999">Now, even if that were true it wouldn't do these petitioners any good, because they're doing exactly what they say what Maislin said they couldn't do, they're charging lower rates than those set forth in the tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.147" offset="11079989">That's what MCI did in the underlying litigation that led to this; it was negotiating discounts of 5 to 10 percent below its generally applicable tariff rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.344" offset="11116769">And the FCC and MCI each explain in their brief that the consequence of their position is that carriers can go off and cut secret deals, rebates, all the things that 203(c) of the statute prohibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.861" offset="11162745">So even if there were the distinction that they're positing, it wouldn't xx them any good here because this order allows exactly what Maislin prohibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.477" offset="11197226">But the more fundamental point is that there's no distinction in the statute between merely filing rates, which they say is a 203 obligation, and merely following tariffs, which they say is the 203(c) duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.156" offset="11248008">The two obligations are absolutely parallel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.328" offset="11260652">They're just different ways of saying the same thing; they're opposite sides of the same coin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.049" offset="11275594">If you charge a customer a rate that's lower than that set forth in your tariff and don't file the lower negotiated rate, you're violating both section 203 and 20... both section 203(a) and section 203(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.180" offset="11340064">You're violating 203(a) because you're not filing all your charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.342" offset="11356678">You're violating 203(c) because you're charging a customer a rate that's not filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.408" offset="11381024">The two obligations are parallel and they overlap and there's a violation of each, and for that reason Maislin relied both on the duty to file and on the duty to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.943" offset="11423133">At page 126 of the opinion, 497 U.S. at 126, the Court said that the negotiated rates policy was inconsistent with both, quote, the duty to file rates with the Commission, citing the counterpart to 203(a), and the obligation to charge only those rates, citing the counterpart to 203(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.845" offset="11498679">So what this case ultimately boils down this... and this is, you know, really more in the reply briefs than the argument today... is they're arguing that you shouldn't follow the Maislin precedent here because the case involves, they say, a different industry and a different statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.977" offset="11555208">And in arguing that, they're asking you to overrule another line of cases which says that statutes that are modeled on the Interstate Commerce Act are to be construed the same way unless there's material differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.982" offset="11599303">That principle dates back at least to the 1932 U.S. Navigation case, which we cite in our brief, and it was the basis for Maislin.</text>

            <text syncTime="2913.457" offset="11805148">It allowed the large... the pipeline with whom the small producers sold to file the rates, and the Court said that that would be consistent with the statute if it were the case... and it was a remand, but if were the case that in regulating the rates of the large producer, it could be assured that the small producers' rates were just and reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2948.830" offset="11946627">I think if you could ever have a situation like that, comparable to that in the telecommunications industry... which I can't imagine, but if you ever could it would okay because the rates would be on file and the Commission would be in a position to assure that the rates were lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.490" offset="12005350">So I don't think... and the Texaco case that they cite says that the Commission cannot exempt carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.745" offset="12038369">It says they cannot be exempt, carriers, from the requirements of section 204, which is where the rate-filing requirement lives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.499" offset="12069298">So it's a curious citation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.841" offset="12074732">So I think their position ultimately boils down to an argument that you shouldn't follow the Interstate Commerce Act precedents because this case involves a different statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.237" offset="12112348">But Maislin rejected that, because there the Court applied pre-1935 decisions under the original Interstate Commerce Act, which applied only to railroads, and they applied it to motor carriers who were operating under a statute which to them was a successor to the 1935 Motor Carrier Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.681" offset="12182043">And in this situation, the Interstate Commerce Act precedents absolutely should apply because the statute was... the provisions we're dealing with here, sections 201 to 210, were copied almost verbatim from those in the Interstate Commerce Act, and this is a case like Laurilar v. Ponds where Congress exhibited, you know, detailed knowledge of the provisions of another statute, copied those provisions it wanted to follow, and then departed from other provisions it didn't want to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.478" offset="12301265">Sections 201 to 210 of the Communications Act were copied from those of the Interstate Commerce Act, and then they didn't want to allow the FCC to preempt State regulation in the ways that the ICC had been allowed to do under an earlier precedent of this Court that was at issue in the 1986 Louisiana v. FCC case, so they put other provisions in the statute to make sure that the FCC wouldn't in those limited respects have the same powers the ICC had and wouldn't be subject to the same restrictions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3229.483" offset="13069265">In response to AT&amp;T's comments about Maislin and the filed rate doctrine, it is true, as has been pointed out, that that's a different issue arising under a different statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.763" offset="13114405">I'd also like to suggest that it's instructive to consider what... how... what would happen if the Communications Act said that the FCC may modify any requirement, including the tariff-filing requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.481" offset="13169262">If the statute said that, I think there'd be no doubt... we wouldn't be here today, it would be clear that we could modify the tariff-filing requirement if the statute said modify any requirement, including the tariff-filing requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.718" offset="13218268">Now, in this hypothetical statute, in that circumstance what had been said in a different context arising under a different statute wouldn't matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.494" offset="13253377">In fact, that phrase including the tariff-filing requirement would be redundant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.337" offset="13272707">The statute says "modify any requirement", and it would be a peculiar rule of statutory construction that required Congress to be redundant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.064" offset="13311577">Now, one thing that's clearly come out--</text>

            <text syncTime="3327.488" offset="13461311">We think that it's clear that it therefore reads 203(b)(2) to say modify some requirements, not any requirement, and that is what the statute says.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.916" offset="13503003">One final point, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.967" offset="13511257">You know, the... it's been suggested that Congress would... couldn't imagine a detariffed world.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.041" offset="13543545">Well, just last summer with respect to commercial mobile carriers like cellular carriers in section 332(c), Congress authorized... what Congress did was say that these cellular companies are generally subject to the title II requirements we've been discussing today, but it said that the Commission may waive any requirement, including the tariff-filing requirement, except for three that it specified: 201, 202, and 208.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.799" offset="13650542">202 is the one that prohibits unreasonable discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.382" offset="13664857">So Congress, as shown last year in its enactment concerning cellular telephones, clearly envisions that unreasonable discrimination may be prohibited without tariffs.</text>
