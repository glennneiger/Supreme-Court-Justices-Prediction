            <text syncTime="12.080" offset="193242">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.902" offset="204527">This case presents the question whether it is constitutionally permissible to insist that certain claims be litigated all at once in a single Federal class action, rather than through numerous repetitive and possibly inconsistent lawsuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.913" offset="268579">Our position is, first, that there is no due process bar to this useful procedure where, as is no longer disputed in this case, the class action court has jurisdiction over the class and the interests of the class members were fairly represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.766" offset="339946">Where those conditions are met, the choice whether to have a mandatory class action for particular kinds of claim should remain only a matter of policy, including where monetary claims are at stake, and second, even if the Constitution requires more than the interest in avoiding multiple suits to justify mandatory class action, such as the interest reflected in (b)(1) and (b)(2) of current Rule 23, those additional interests are present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.795" offset="460109">Now, if I can put aside the question of personal jurisdiction, which is now conceded here, I want to begin with the relevant history as to class actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.481" offset="494800">That history has two aspects, the first--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="90.456" offset="506712">Mr. Taranto, I hope in your history you will cover whether you think (b)(2) and (b)(3) classifications are interchangeable so that if you have a group where some might prefer the (b)(3) class, that is, making compensatory damages the thing, and others are content with the (b)(2) classification, a court can nonetheless force on the people who might prefer the (b)(3) class the one in which you cannot opt out.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_g_taranto" startTime="121.154" stopTime="307.411">
            <label>Mr. Richard G. Taranto</label>
            <text syncTime="121.154" offset="629487">--I think that as a constitutional matter, it is permissible for the rulemakers or for Congress to decide that once the conditions of numerosity and adequate representation are fully guaranteed, that the interests in having a single mandatory class and therefore denying opt-out rights are constitutionally sufficient, necessarily notwithstanding the desire of certain individuals to pursue their own litigation, and I think, as a constitutional matter, that is in fact consistent with the history of this Court's treatment and the evolution of the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.139" offset="777445">This Court has, beginning in the 1854 case of Smith, on through the insurance benefit cases in the early decades of this century, then on through Hansberry v. Lee and later cases, always identified adequacy of representation as the constitutional benchmark, and some of those cases, notably the insurance cases, specifically involve monetary claims where in some sense (b)(3) in current terms might have been available for certain people who wanted to opt out.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.828" offset="904191">What the Court has never done is to declare the particular circumstances where mandatory class actions have been permitted are the only ones where that is constitutionally so, and in particular, the one sentence in Shutts, Phillips Petroleum v. Shutts, that the Ninth Circuit relied on, doesn't do that, because Shutts is only about the prerequisites for personal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.325" offset="998232">The second aspect of the history that I think is important here is precisely the evolution of choices about when mandatory classes are appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.213" offset="1033758">One set of choices is, of course, embodied in the current Rule 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.097" offset="1049327">Another set of choices is currently under consideration by the advisory committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.000" offset="1064896">An earlier set of choices was embodied in the original 1938 rules, and still before that, before the rules in 1938, there was a wide variety of opinion among all sorts of courts about when mandatory class actions were appropriate with... and the important point about that variety of opinion and the evolution of choices is that the debate has always been on nonconstitutional grounds, insofar as relevant today.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.128" offset="1173461">There was once a jury trial issue, but that's not any longer a live issue after the merger of law and equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.343" offset="1202300">So what the history I think stands for is precisely flexibility as a policy matter about when the interests in consolidating all actions in a single proceeding override any remaining individual interest, and that flexibility I think is perfectly correct under the prevailing due process analysis of Mathews v. Eldridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.218" offset="1293833">The reasons for mandatory class actions derive from the basic defining characteristic of numerosity.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.503" offset="1318911">Where that is present, there are strong interests in avoiding costly, repetitive, possibly inconsistent results, and these interests have a number of overlapping aspects that can appear in different mixes in different kinds of cases.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="307.411" offset="1374604">May I ask if it's your view that if the district judge here had determined that (b)(3) was the appropriate mode for this, that that would also be all right, that this is totally a matter of discretion for the initial trier?</text>
            <text syncTime="324.553" offset="1443149">If he styles this a (b)(2) class, then that's okay, but equally, it wouldn't have been wrong, would it, for the trial judge to have said, this case I think belongs under the (b)(3) mold, and there should be notice and an opportunity to opt out, because some people might prefer compensatory relief?</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard G. Taranto</label>
            <text syncTime="343.757" offset="1519949">I think it is a matter of discretion in the sense that courts of appeals review certification decisions under a fairly deferential abuse of discretion standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.864" offset="1560387">I think a certification under (b)(3) rather than under (b)(1) or (b)(2) where those conditions are met can in fact be an abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.372" offset="1594450">One of the points that has been made by many courts is that (b)(3) is a kind of catch-all provision, and most cases that would properly fall under (b)(1) and (b)(2) could also come within (b)(3), and the structure of the rules therefore suggest that there will be some cases that really should be categorized under (b)(1) and (b)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="384.134" offset="1681490">There are cases, and I think this is properly one, in which at a minimum it was proper to certify the case under (b)(1) and (b)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="393.671" offset="1719629">Whether the certification was so clearly proper under those standards that certifying it under (b)(3) instead would have been an abuse of discretion, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.768" offset="1759962">Of course, if this had been certified under (b)(3), this whole constitutional issue would not in fact have arisen, because then opt-out rights would have been provided in the original lawsuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="412.704" offset="1795698">Mr. Taranto, can... do you think a State or Congress could establish a system in which you no longer have the choice of your own lawyer to prosecute causes of action, saying, you know, lawyers have gotten too expensive, we're going to establish a career attorney system, and you simply get assigned your lawyer when you want to vindicate some civil right?</text>

            <text syncTime="647.724" offset="2735792">But let me return if I may for 1 minute, it is true that this Court has not... had not had to deal with a class action, a mandatory class action outside some broad view of what a limited fund is, but other courts did in fact deal with such cases, and if one looks at some of the prior history, prior to 1938, some of the cases discussed in the influential articles by Professor Chafee, I think what that shows is that various courts were in fact treating the avoidance of multiple litigation as, by itself, a sufficient interest to have a single, mandatory proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="894.983" offset="3724893">I mean, the... Rule 23 does not itself determine the preclusive effect of judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.048" offset="3745059">It plainly was intended to provide that everybody included within the judgment shall be bound by the judgment but does not itself lay down the preclusion rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.797" offset="3788109">The preclusion rules continue, by and large, to be a matter of Federal common law, and those rules, if one looks at the Restatement or this Court's cases, basically say that a representative action where adequacy of representation is guaranteed shall have preclusive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.449" offset="3854669">There are certain elements of discretion embodied in those rules, but in general the finality and efficiency purposes that preclusion rules are designed to serve do in fact require a certain measure of clarity as to those standards as well, and therefore the discretion as to preclusion is relatively minimal, though there is a genuine important judgment to be made about when the representation was truly adequate.</text>

            <text syncTime="998.849" offset="4140344">Well, let me say two things about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.122" offset="4149435">First, I think that that would necessarily present a question about adequacy of representation that is not presented in his Court, but second, I think in this particular case that would not make sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.229" offset="4189872">If one puts oneself back in the framework of 1985 and 1986, and looks in particular at the dispute over whether Arizona and Wisconsin and certain other States were different in relevant respects from the other States affected by the class, I think it is very hard to question the judgment of not only adequate but in fact quite vigorous representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.057" offset="4293108">Recall, back in '85, within 3 months of the filing of this lawsuit, this Court decided the Southern Motor Carriers case, suddenly creating a much more substantial... indeed, what the district court in Philadelphia thought, a pretty clearly winning State action defense on antitrust grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.311" offset="4370117">There is also the McCarran-Ferguson question, which has still not been finally resolved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.827" offset="4400210">Those are questions that, of course, have taken the FTC 9 years to litigate, and the judgment is still not final as to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.792" offset="4432080">Beyond those two questions there is at least the question, not present in the FTC case, of seeking damages, and where damages are alleged, there would be the additional burden of establishing that, even if the participation in the rating bureaus was illegal under the antitrust laws, that the resulting rates were higher than what they would have been in a purely competitive system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.466" offset="4522777">And with respect to all of those factors, what Judge Van Artsdellon decided, and what the lower courts in this case decided, was that there really were no concrete appreciable differences between Arizona and Wisconsin on the one hand, and the other States on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.956" offset="4592785">And whatever differences there may have been were so outweighed by the prospect of 9 years of additional litigation, all for the prospect of possibly no damages at the end of the day, that it was a perfectly reasonable, responsible choice of a vigorous advocate to say, we will settle for the following sorts of injunctive relief, some of which is retrospective, in the sense that it provides additional insurance benefits to all members of the class, and so I think in this particular case there really is no ground for deciding that some higher level of representative adequacy is necessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1153.005" offset="4756939">I suppose it would follow from what you say that it would at least be constitutionally open to provide a trial regime in which a Court could conclude that one were... that a given plaintiff was not subject to a summary judgment motion, and was not subject to a dismissal motion, but on grounds of unlikelihood of success, in effect could suffer a dismissal, because that in effect is the standard by which you are judging, or I think you were judging the reasonableness of the decision that was made about the adequate representation of those who wanted to go all the way for damages, or at least claimed they did.</text>

            <text syncTime="1201.065" offset="4949200">Well, I think it is important to separate the question of adequacy of representation leading to an adjudicated decision and adequacy of representation leading to a settlement, although the two are necessarily, in practical terms, interlinked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.997" offset="5020880">Here, I think, in fact both of those that the representation was perfectly adequate as to both, just as I think it was perfectly reasonable to certify this particular class under both (b)(1) and (b)(2), and (b)(1), the critical point is... what (b)(1) says is that we should certify a class if there's a risk of varying inconsistent or varying adjudications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.483" offset="5110846">And what that has been used for time and again are cases not simply in which the defendant might be told by one court to do something and another court to do precisely the opposite, but rather for a whole range of circumstances involving Government benefits and other kinds of situations where the defendant has some kind of legal obligation to act consistently toward all the plaintiff class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.009" offset="5204991">Here, the defendants do have that obligation, and they have that obligation not only prospectively in terms of the rates that they would charge or their behavior in establishing insurance rates within a particular State, but retrospectively as well, because any damages that would be paid would in effect create a retroactive rate, and all the... all the State regulatory regimes here declare that there shall not be discrimination through all of the writs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1316.067" offset="5409164">That would, though, however, have been quite dramatically changed by this Court's decision in Southern Motor Carriers, because by the time the FTC brought its action in early 1985, and these actions were then filed literally within days of the FTC action, the participation in the rating bureaus was by and large over, so in that sense, at that time, they were mostly looking for retrospective relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.096" offset="5517311">What Southern Motor Carriers did was suddenly, in a very real sense, to raise the prospect of future participation in rating bureaus being permitted.</text>

Lee, it can't mean that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.780" offset="8155992">The basic principle that's at issue here is the principle that parties that are not... persons who are not party to a lawsuit may not be bound by a judgment entered in that litigation, and that an attempt to enforce such a judgment against such a person is violative of both the Fifth and the Fourteenth Amendments, and that is in the critical paragraph spanning pages 40 to 41 of Hansberry v. Lee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.615" offset="8255361">So we already know that there is a principle that is equally applicable under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2097.181" offset="8533618">In fact, this Court, when dealing with foreign nationals, has treated their right to protection from jurisdiction of any United States court as stemming also from the Due Process Clause, not from Article 3, so arguments about greater sovereignty of a Federal court potentially, had Congress granted that, versus a State court, really can't be what Shutts is about.</text>

            <text syncTime="2151.430" offset="8750643">Having disposed of that issue, as this Court did in Shutts by concluding that there was no requirement for minimum contacts by absent class members, the Court then went on and described what was required as a matter of minimal due process, and it does so in terms of a host of protections that are traditionally thought of in terms of procedural due process equally owed by a Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.626" offset="8839459">There is nothing in the opinion, other than in responding to the personal jurisdiction arguments that had been raised below, that suggests that the decision should not apply to a Federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2348.137" offset="9537451">The governmental interest in avoiding multiple suits, we contend, is equally protected in (b)(3) actions with one exception, and the one exception is where, in the case of a settlement class, the settlement is not fair to all of the claimants, and where the settlement is not fair, the governmental interest in avoiding multiple cases must give way to the fairness that is owed to the adversely affected class members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.709" offset="9667750">Few people opt out of settlements that are fair, particularly where they need to then go fund the litigation, and particularly in class action situations where the amount of damages typically is not as large as a normal private suit might involve.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.366" offset="9718428">So the reason for attempting to avoid opt-out can't be because there's a strong governmental interest in avoiding multiple suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.852" offset="9752282">The principal reason is because defendants seek to avoid all future litigation in the settlement, seek to use it as a way to cut off any future claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.431" offset="9794601">Well, allowing that to occur certainly does foster greater efficiency in the sense that it ends litigation, but it doesn't foster greater fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.177" offset="9833575">If opt-out is allowed, those who opt out are opting out because they believe their claims will be adversely affected by the settlement that is proposed, or in the more typical case, which is not this case, where the certification occurs at the beginning of the case, not when the case is being settled and those individual class members are able to exercise their full... their full power under the basic principle of Hansberry v. Lee to decide their own litigation fate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2517.310" offset="10214127">They didn't know there was a case in the first place.</text>
