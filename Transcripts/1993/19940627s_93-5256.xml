            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="91003">The opinion of the Court in No. 93-5256, Williamson against the United States will be announced by Justice O'Connor.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="9.088" offset="127261">This case comes here on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.252" offset="151921">The petitioner, Williamson, was convicted of various drug crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.504" offset="168952">One piece of evidence against him was the confession of a confederate, Reginald Harris.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.263" offset="192045">In that confession, Harris admitted to transporting cocaine but also said other things that implicated Williamson.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.806" offset="226213">Because the confession was made out of court, it was hearsay but the District Court admitted it as a statement against penal interest in the proceeding against Williamson, pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="51.753" offset="297997">Rule 804(b)(3) allows hearsay statements to be admitted if they so far tend to expose the person making those statements to criminal liability that a reasonable person would not make them unless they were true.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.944" offset="362676">Williamson appealed his conviction claiming that Harris' statement was not actually against Harris' penal interest because it tried to shift blame and curry favor with the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.913" offset="418579">The Court of Appeals rejected that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.574" offset="433207">In an opinion filed today, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.877" offset="458494">We hold that rule 804(b)(3) allows only the admission of those individual statements in a confession that are actually against the declarants' penal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.265" offset="504051">It does not allow the admission of the entire confession just because some parts of it are against the declarant's interest or because the confession, seen as a whole, is against the declarant's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.263" offset="555983">Because at least some of what Harris said really did not implicate Harris himself, but only implicated Williamson, we conclude that those statements should not have been admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.875" offset="602481">We remand the case to the Court of Appeals to apply these principles in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.868" offset="626409">Justice Scalia who has joined this opinion also filed a concurring opinion; Justice Ginsburg has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment which is joined by Justices Blackmun, Stevens, and Souter; Justice Kennedy has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which the Chief Justice and Justice Thomas join.</text>
