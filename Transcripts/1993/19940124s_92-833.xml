            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="91414">In the last of the four cases which I have to announce is Albright against Oliver, No.92-833.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.360" offset="128821">This case presents the question whether the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment recognizes a substantive right to be free from criminal prosecution except upon probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.922" offset="175006">Upon learning that an arrest warrant had been issued charging him with the crime of selling a substance that looked like an illegal drug, petitioner, Kevin Albright in Illinois, surrendered to respondent, Roger Oliver, a policeman, and was released after posting bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.266" offset="244387">Later at a preliminary hearing, the policeman, Oliver, testified that Albright sold a look-a-like substance to a confidential informant and the court found probable cause to bind Albright over for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.516" offset="301438">However, the court later dismissed the action because the charge did not state an offense under Illinois law.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.957" offset="331218">Albright then filed this suit under Section 1983 alleging that Oliver deprived him of substantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to be free from criminal prosecution except on probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.143" offset="387956">The District Court and the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ruled against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.166" offset="411989">In deciding this case, we have produced a veritable cornucopia of opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.842" offset="434767">I have filed an opinion with the Clerk, joined by Justices O'Connor, Scalia, and Ginsburg which concludes that Albright's claimed right to be free from prosecution without probable cause must be judged under the Fourth Amendment and not the vague area of substantive due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.580" offset="509687">Since Albright asserted only the latter, his claim must fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.482" offset="529331">Justice Scalia and Ginsburg have filed separate concurring opinions; Justice Kennedy has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment which is joined by Justice Thomas; Justice Souter has also filed an opinion concurring in the judgment; Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Blackmun has joined.</text>
