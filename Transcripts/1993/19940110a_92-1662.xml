            <text syncTime="9.272" offset="176348">Mr. Hungar.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas G. Hungar</label>
            <text syncTime="10.422" offset="180946">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.010" offset="199336">Respondent was convicted of a felony that carries a maximum sentence of 5 years in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.145" offset="219921">Under the Sentencing Guidelines, the presumptive imprisonment range was zero to 6 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.465" offset="241132">Instead of sending respondent to prison, the district court imposed a sentence of 60 months probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.769" offset="258373">Shortly after he began serving that sentence, respondent tested positive for cocaine, and the district court revoked his probation and sentenced him to 20 months in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.725" offset="298183">The court imposed that sentence under 18 U.S.C. section 3565 (a), which provides that when a defendant possesses illegal drugs while on probation, the court shall revoke the sentence of probation and sentence the defendant to not less than one-third of the original sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.551" offset="357534">The court of appeals reversed, holding that the phrase "original sentence" refers to the presumptive range of imprisonment that could have been imposed under the guidelines rather than the sentence of probation that was actually imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.625" offset="409779">We submit that the court of appeals erred in reaching that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.862" offset="426706">Our argument has two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.881" offset="434856">First, the interpretation adopted by the court of appeals and urged by respondent is flatly inconsistent with the plain language of the statute and must be rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.587" offset="473622">Second, once respondent's interpretation has been rejected, there are only two suggested ways to read the statute, and of those, only our interpretation is consistent with the statutory structure, context, and purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.830" offset="530673">Turning to the first point, our principal disagreement with respondent concerns the plain meaning of the phrase, "original sentence".</text>
            <text syncTime="105.233" offset="560244">In our view, under either the dictionary definition, or the ordinary, common sense understanding of that phrase, it has only one possible meaning in the context of Federal sentencing law.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.125" offset="603816">It means the initial judgment of the court specifying the punishment to be imposed on a convicted criminal.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="122.279" offset="628371">If that's the case, then you're arguing for a sentence of probation all over again, only one-third of... with a one-third minimum of the original.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.967" offset="659196">I mean, if plain meaning is good, you've got to take plain meaning all the way.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas G. Hungar</label>
            <text syncTime="134.270" offset="676437">With respect, Justice Souter, we don't agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.955" offset="687095">We certainly agree that we have to take plain meaning all the way, but the fact that "original sentence" means the sentence of probation that was imposed in this case does not mean that the defendant here had to be sentenced to a new sentence of probation, and there are two reasons why that is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.881" offset="742788">We agree that the phrase, "one-third of the original sentence", if considered in isolation, has two possible meanings.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.452" offset="769119">It could refer to the length of the original sentence, in this case 20 months, or to the length and the type of the original sentence, in this case 20 months of probation, and if that were the only thing we had to go on, the answer you suggest would be the only one possible under the Rule of Lenity, but we have other guides to congressional intent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.247" offset="840277">First, and most important, is the context in which that provision, one-third of the original sentence, rests.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.834" offset="870683">In section 3565(a), Congress required the court to revoke the sentence of probation before resentencing the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.089" offset="903702">The word "revoke" is a term of art in Federal sentencing law in the context of probation or other forms of conditional release.</text>

            <text syncTime="204.683" offset="958037">If Congress had more clearly expressed its intention, then obviously we wouldn't be here, but we don't believe the statute is so poorly drafted that we can't discern, by applying normal rules of statutory construction, the meaning that Congress in fact intended.</text>

            <text syncTime="220.043" offset="1019477">Mr. Hungar, following up on Justice Souter's question, I suppose at the time the statute was enacted there might well have been people still incarcerated who were sentenced to a term of imprisonment followed by a term of probation, and supposing someone was in jail on a 15-year sentence, 10 years jail imprisonment plus 5 years probation, and that had not expired at the time the statute was enacted, and that person had his probation revoked in the third year of the probation period, what would the appropriate sentence be there?</text>

            <text syncTime="254.864" offset="1158761">Well, as I understand the preexisting sentencing scheme, Your Honor, that would not be a possible sentence, because the way probation formerly worked was that it was an alternative to imprisonment.</text>

            <text syncTime="276.713" offset="1246115">The judge would either impose a sentence and then suspend the execution of that sentence, or would suspend sentencing, so either there would be a suspended sentence of imprisonment, or no sentence at all, then the defendant would be on probation, but probation could not... you couldn't sentence a defendant to so many years of prison followed by so many years of probation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2830.322" offset="11460619">This statute... the effective date of this provision was to those defendants whose term of probation began in 1989.</text>

            <text syncTime="3151.382" offset="12744799">Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy I think and others have suggested that our interpretation is not consistent with the plain language, so we just have to pick and choose between various inconsistent interpretations... that is, interpretations that aren't consistent with the plain language, but our interpretation is consistent with the plain language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.109" offset="12807702">It is possible for the phrase, "one-third of the original sentence", to refer to the length but not the type of the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.197" offset="12836123">Indeed, Congress used exactly that same formulation in section 3583(g), because there the Congress... the term of imprisonment to be imposed depends on, and is based on one-third of the term of supervised release, but we know from the context that Congress didn't mean a new term of supervised release that's one third as long as the old term, even though it used the same structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.695" offset="12918043">It meant, in prison, and it made that very clear in section 3583(g).</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.397" offset="12932881">We think it's equally clear here in context, because when Congress said, sentence the defendant, Congress had already said, revoke probation, so we know probation is not an option.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.419" offset="12969034">Therefore, by saying, sentence the defendant to not less than one-third of the original sentence, Congress had to be saying, sentence the defendant to prison, and the only question is how long, and that is answered by the phrase, not less than one-third--</text>
