            <text syncTime="36.385" offset="294990">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="39.457" offset="307320">The previous case considered the relationships in a maritime tort system between the claimants and the nonsettling tortfeasors.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.755" offset="348489">In this case, we're going to consider the relationship in a maritime tort system between the settling tortfeasor and the nonsettling tortfeasors.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.589" offset="379836">This proceeding arises from a limitation of liability case filed as a result of an accident which occurred on the navigable waters of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.674" offset="416198">The accident was a collision between a sailboat and an electric power line in a place called Gasparilla Pass on the West Coast of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.531" offset="451620">Boca Grande Club was the owner of the sailboat.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.522" offset="463532">Florida Power &amp; Light Company was the owner of the power line.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.725" offset="476384">The sailboat had been rented to Dr. Robert Polackwich, who was a member of the club, and his stepson, Jonathan Richards.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.558" offset="503760">Both Dr. Polackwich and Mr. Richards died from electrocution as a result of the collision.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.053" offset="529674">Boca Grande Club started this limitation case, and claims were filed in the action by the Polackwich and Richards personal representatives, relatives of the deceased, Florida Power &amp; Light Company, and O'Day Corporation, the sailboat's manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.314" offset="594771">Boca Grande Club filed a motion for summary judgment with the district court as to all claims, based on the contention that the collision was solely caused by the fact that Florida Power &amp; Light Company did not erect and maintain the power line at the minimum height above the navigable waters as required by the Army Corps of Engineers permit.</text>

            <text syncTime="140.363" offset="710964">The choice between a proportionate credit rule and a pro tanto or dollar-for-dollar deduction rule would, if the Court selects a proportional credit rule, basically eliminate any claim for contribution as an operation of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.263" offset="778569">The claim would not arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.685" offset="784211">The district court in this case granted Boca Grande Club summary judgment as to the contribution claims of Florida Power &amp; Light Company following settlement with the Polackwich and Richards Claimants.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.127" offset="845964">The basis of the summary judgment granted by the district court was the decision of the Eleventh Circuit in Self v. Great Lakes, which had recognized the settlement bar rule with respect to contribution claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.832" offset="896851">The Eleventh Circuit decided a subsequent case, styled Great Lakes v. Tanker, before the time to appeal the summary judgment had expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.980" offset="937393">Boca Grande... excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.621" offset="947947">The Great Lakes case held that the settlement bar rule announced in Self was dicta, and said that both settling and nonsettling tortfeasors could sue for contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.878" offset="992982">The Great Lakes Tanker case does not place a limitation as to whether the party bringing the contribution claim is one who himself has settled, or one who is seeking contribution from a party who already settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.826" offset="1048779">Florida Power &amp; Light Company appealed the summary judgment, and the Eleventh Circuit reversed on the basis of its decision in Great Lakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.373" offset="1078977">The relief Boca Grande Club seeks is reversal of the ruling by the Eleventh Circuit and establishment of a rule in this case that will allow it to be protected from contribution claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.251" offset="1126520">This relief can be accomplished regardless of which settlement credit the Court may adopt as a result of the McDermott case.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="321.211" offset="1434347">Well, if the Court in the preceding case were to adopt a proportionate fault rule... I don't know that it will, but if it did, what would be our best disposition of this case, just to vacate and remand?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_f_pope" startTime="340.153" stopTime="428.409">
            <label>Mr. David F. Pope</label>
            <text syncTime="340.153" offset="1510102">Justice O'Connor, I believe that would be correct, because the cause of action upon which Florida Power &amp; Light Company sues... namely, the contribution claim... would cease to exist as a matter of law, because it could not be paying more than its proportionate share of the fault, period, so there would be no... the contribution as a theoretical right would exist, but not for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.039" offset="1605605">As Justice O'Connor has indicated, under the proportionate credit, or sometimes it's been called the pro rata rule, the nonsettling tortfeasor receives a credit for the settling tortfeasor's concurrent fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.229" offset="1666418">The nonsettling tortfeasor is held responsible only for its own fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.043" offset="1689615">No claim for contribution exists, since the nonsettling tortfeasor is not being held liable for anyone's fault but its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.297" offset="1722634">We would suggest, however, that even under a proportionate credit or pro rata rule, a settlement bar would still be necessary because of the ruling of the Eleventh Circuit in Great Lakes v. Tanker, which permitted settling tortfeasors to seek contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.242" offset="1802464">Under those circumstances, it is conceivable that there could be a complete settlement between all of the parties, and nonetheless one of the settling parties believing it had paid too much, institute contribution actions against others.</text>

            <text syncTime="659.913" offset="2789161">I'm sorry, because what happened in the Great Lakes case was that Chevron early on settled with all of the personal injury claimants who were crew members of the other vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.020" offset="2833569">Great Lakes, the owner of the other vessel and employer of the crewmen, did not settle with its employees because the employees had claims under the Jones Act and for unseaworthiness that they did not have against Chevron as the owner of the other vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.300" offset="2898667">In point of fact, throughout the case, Chevron settled early on, Great Lakes settled with Self, the last remaining claimant, after the second appeal to the Eleventh Circuit, so in fact all the claims were settled, none of them were ever tried, and the district court in the Great Lakes remand is now faced with the unhappy prospect of trying eleven separate personal injury actions between two settling defendants on damages for people that 10 years ago left the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.993" offset="3041504">In fact, the district court entered an order on December 22nd in that case scheduling the case for trial the weeks... during the trial term beginning in April of 1994.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.031" offset="3085599">The Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act and the Restatement of Torts, Second, in 886A recognized this type of credit, but I would point out that the Restatement lists all the credits that are possible, a proportionate, a pro tanto credit, and a settlement bar with a good faith hearing requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.384" offset="3175042">We would submit that any good faith hearing requirement under a pro tanto credit regime, which goes beyond satisfying the court that the agreement between the settling parties is noncollusive, would have an extremely adverse effect on settlements.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.946" offset="3245259">In effect, there would be a minitrial, trying to equate the settling parties' fault or proportional fault and damages in advance of the main trial, which would necessarily involve factual issues, and therefore probably would be subject to appeal, and the benefit derived to the settling tortfeasor of being able to close his books on this matter would be lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.251" offset="3334493">There would probably be an appeal, and the matter might be kept alive for a great amount of time.</text>

            <text syncTime="837.708" offset="3500319">And basically the thrust of that opinion, which is called Dasdorian... I can't remember the second name of the party, but the Dasdorian case said that henceforth in Florida we're not going to allow cases to go forward where as part of the settlement agreement the settling defendant either agrees to participate in the trial and lay off blame, or help the plaintiff lay off blame on the nonsettling defendants, or agrees to assist or aid the claimant in some way that is improper.</text>

            <text syncTime="872.453" offset="3639290">A Mary Carter agreement is an agreement whereby, at least as I understand it in Florida, whereby a defendant secretly settles with the plaintiff but nonetheless agrees to participate in the trial and assist the plaintiff in the prosecution of the claim against the nonsettling defendant, and the Florida courts have outlawed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.207" offset="3718284">The... I would like to note that the agreement that was described to you earlier in the prior argument is what I would call in Florida a high-low agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.831" offset="3748796">That is, an agreement whereby a defendant agrees to settle, and if you recover X dollars from the nonsettling defendant, I'll pay you this, but if you don't get that much, I'll pay you X plus something else, and that's called a high-low agreement, and the Florida said that kind of agreement's okay, as long as you don't procure assistance to subvert the trial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.969" offset="3849315">In other words, what they try to do is protect the nonsettling defendant's day in court, as I understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.430" offset="3867182">If a pro tanto credit with full contribution, which is the Eleventh Circuit rule, is adopted, any settlements in a multiparty maritime tort case will be extremely unlikely.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.439" offset="3923293">I say this for the following reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.371" offset="3934996">The settling tortfeasor is subject to the results of the trial he does not participate in.</text>

            <text syncTime="1011.453" offset="4195280">We would go back to the Eleventh Circuit rule and suggest to the Court that a settling tortfeasor who is subject to the results of the trial and does not participate in it would probably be disinclined most... extremely disinclined to enter into any settlement agreement with the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.057" offset="4277723">An additional disadvantage to the settling tortfeasor is that he cannot close his books on this casualty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.863" offset="4304890">He has to keep this matter open until the claim is ultimately resolved against the settling tortfeasor, and if there is contribution, that's resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.348" offset="4342924">In this very case, we may be looking at procedures 3, 4, and 5 years in the future if the Eleventh Circuit's ruling is upheld, given the State court appeals, the possibility of a retrial in the State court, and then perhaps a contribution action at some later date against Boca Grande Club who, as a limitation plaintiff, the only place that court... that case could be heard would be in the U.S. district court in Tampa, so we have that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.605" offset="4451907">I heard it mentioned in the earlier argument that a full contribution or nonsettlement bar probably would penalize a claimant, too, because a cautious settling defendant would probably insert into the settlement agreement an indemnity provision or maybe escrow some of the funds, I don't know quite how... there's many ways it could be accomplished, but which would protect the possibility if contribution... there were no settlement bar, that the settling defendant might have to pay back some money at some time in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.815" offset="4572698">Every maritime court, other than the Eleventh Circuit, which has considered the settlement bar issue, has opted for a rule that terminates the contribution claim either by a proportionate credit or by a pro tanto rule with a settlement bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.179" offset="4650229">The cases other than this case that have adopted pro tanto and settlement bar have all opted for a good faith hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.645" offset="4688054">This Court... excuse me, those courts that recognize a settlement bar rule are recognizing a corollary principle of conservation of judicial resources and encouraging settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.565" offset="4743747">We believe that these policies are worthy of consideration in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.346" offset="4762869">Boca Grand Club does not believe that any decisions of this Court prohibit adoption of a settlement bar rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.211" offset="4794320">The rules established in reliable transfer for comparative fault in Cooper for contribution and Edmonds for joint and several liability can still all operate as between the nonsettling parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.222" offset="4850327">Nothing in those cases would prohibit a settlement bar rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.463" offset="4867359">None of them dealt with the situation of a settling tortfeasor and a nonsettling tortfeasor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.068" offset="4893795">Boca Grande Club notes that in the recent decision of Musick, Peeler, this Court recognized its authority to provide a just and equitable remedy for cases within admiralty jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.118" offset="4945935">We would submit that recognition of a settlement bar rule is further recognition of a just and equitable resolution of this maritime tort problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.933" offset="4981253">The arguments advanced against a settlement bar rule by Florida Power &amp; Light in the United States are flawed because the basic assumption of those arguments is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.709" offset="5024302">I believe in the earlier argument we alluded to this a little bit, but the basic assumption of Florida Power &amp; Light in the United States is that the primarily liable tortfeasor who is the deep pocket, as that term is used, will be called to go to trial, while the... excuse me, I misspoke myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.084" offset="5113850">The primarily liable but impecunious defendant who settles will transfer his liability to the less liable but deep pocket defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.593" offset="5167871">In other words, the plaintiff will proceed to trial against the party that can best pay the judgment, rather than the party that has the greatest culpability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.309" offset="5202771">This is really not an objection to a settlement bar rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1322.037" offset="5437664">We don't see any reason why the plaintiff among the nonsettling defendants can't collect all of its judgment from one of those defendants and then they settle among themselves on contribution, since they didn't settle their respective proportionate degrees of fault, so we think the rules still operate, but they should operate only as to the nonsettling parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.773" offset="5532541">We would also point out that if a settling tortfeasor really has limited assets, all the discussion about contribution is somewhat meaningless, since the contribution claim is going to be basically worthless either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.894" offset="5601086">If he wasn't interested in defending his position and trying to get out cheaply on the initial claim, I doubt seriously any contribution claim would cause any great concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.510" offset="5647480">A final matter on the arguments of Florida Power &amp; Light and the United States, they suggest that if a tortfeasor is truly the most culpable and will settle, that the claimant will go along with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.172" offset="5718219">It has been my experience that the claimant, the plaintiff in an action, avoids if at all possible an empty chair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.129" offset="5749984">It is stretching the imagination to suggest that the empty chair the plaintiff will accept for a minimum settlement is the most culpable defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.234" offset="5786451">In other words, he will go to trial against a deep pocket who is not really culpable and let out the very party who is the most culpable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.070" offset="5825739">If nothing else, the defendant, given the fact of joint and... excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.033" offset="5841622">The plaintiff, given the fact of joint and several liability, would continue and keep in the less culpable but impecunious defendant because he can recover it all if he proves fault... any fault on the other party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.562" offset="5903689">He wouldn't settle with anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.624" offset="5907973">He wants that chair filled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.086" offset="5913824">He wants that party defending his position, and he doesn't want to be the person standing up in front of the judge or the jury defending somebody that is the most culpable for the very accident for which he claims relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.871" offset="5956978">Boca Grande Club submits that the better rule among the proportionate credit and the pro tanto rule is the proportionate credit rule, although we recognize that that really is a decision for the prior case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.071" offset="6021762">The proportionate credit best accommodates the competing interests of the parties in a multiparty maritime tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.628" offset="6051960">The claimant can settle part of his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.479" offset="6063453">The settling tortfeasor can close his file, and his liability is extinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.292" offset="6082680">The nonsettling tortfeasor receives a credit for the settling tortfeasor's proportionate fault.</text>

            <text syncTime="1545.181" offset="6330216">We're dealing with the settlement in the context of a multidefendant maritime tort action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.466" offset="6347352">With Florida Power's time, I'd like to focus briefly... very briefly on one key and, we think, critical point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.931" offset="6381207">In the event this Court does not adopt the proportionate credit approach, of the remaining options for dealing with partial settlements in this setting, law and fairness dictate that the settlement bar rule and the pro tanto setting be rejected and the contribution approach adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.652" offset="6452051">The first and foremost reason for this position is one of simple fairness, and it's been discussed and alluded to today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.367" offset="6486951">The settlement bar rule tends to disrupt the normal litigation incentives and the pattern of risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.322" offset="6518820">That is to say, the settlement bar rule creates an incentive for the settling parties to saddle the nonsettling defendant with an amount of liability or culpability that far exceeds its true share.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.691" offset="6568244">The settling defendant is willing to settle at a deep discount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.664" offset="6592172">The settling plaintiff may be willing to extend that deep discount because it knows, as a certainty under the pro rata settlement bar rule, that any shortfall or any bad bargain it entered into, has to be made up by the nonsettling defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.486" offset="6663434">The net result is that the nonsettling defendant will bear the burden of a settlement to which it was not a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.841" offset="6696871">The extent of the nonsettling defendant's liability in that setting will not be based on its true fault or culpability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.878" offset="6733024">It will instead be based on an outside-of-court, private deal made by parties and the settling defendant was not a party to the agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1742.541" offset="7119636">As far as Florida Power is concerned, we will be happy with either rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.555" offset="7135728">We will accept either proportionate credit or the contribution approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.799" offset="7152655">I'm assuming that in the event that this Court doesn't opt for the proportionate credit approach, I'm trying to highlight the unfairness of the settlement bar rule in that setting, and I think part of the unfairness comes out of this Court's own cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.247" offset="7214513">Supreme Court cases tell us... for example, in the Cooper Stevedoring case, this Court disapproves a rule that permits a plaintiff to force the entire liability on one of two defendants even if that defendant is equally... that is, the settling defendant is equally or more at fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.130" offset="7290059">In the Reliable Transfer case, which has been discussed at length, this Court talked about principles of fair fault allocation and the fact that those principles should take precedence over quick but inequitable settlements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.669" offset="7348156">Now, it's also been discussed that the settlement bar rule perhaps has one advantage in the pro tanto setting over a contribution approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.626" offset="7387966">The one advantage that the proponents of the settlement bar rule claim is that it is efficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.210" offset="7410327">The argument runs as follows: it's efficient because it has promoted that initial settlement between the plaintiff and the first settlor, but in practice the rule is not efficient, and in practice the rule really doesn't encourage the sort of settlements that the courts want to encourage, the sort of settlements that affect the true judicial economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.824" offset="7492769">In practice, the settlement bar rule and the pro tanto setting frustrates complete settlements, and it will only encourage that initial partial settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.810" offset="7528714">The reason is the reason I gave earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.350" offset="7538849">The settlement can, in effect, serve as a war chest for the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.353" offset="7558911">The plaintiff will be encouraged to litigate against the nonsettling defendant because it knows that whatever bargain it struck at the outset, the nonsettling defendant will be required to make up the shortfall, the discount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.705" offset="7624322">The nonsettling defendant will be required to save it from its own bad bargain, and what makes it particularly unfair, thinking of Reliable Transfer and Cooper Stevedoring, is that that will be the case even though the settling defendant is far, far more culpable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.565" offset="7683777">Of course, in this case the Court required, we do not yet know the relative culpabilities of Florida Power &amp; Light vis-a-vis the Boca Grande Club.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.601" offset="7719930">Another efficiency that has been claimed on behalf of the settlement bar rule as an advantage over contribution has to do with ancillary litigation and the good faith hearing requirement that we've heard discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.309" offset="7774683">It is true that the contribution approach necessarily definitionally involves a second proceeding, a contribution action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.645" offset="7812090">It is also true, however, and the settlement bar rule's own proponents almost universally acknowledge this, that if you're going to administer the settlement bar rule in any sort of meaningful way, and in any way that would detect, perhaps not collusion, that's been discussed, but certainly patent unfairness, then the good faith hearing itself to be efficacious is going to have to be akin to a minitrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.762" offset="7916580">It's going to have to be a full evidentiary hearing on the merits, and it's going to necessarily entail--</text>

            <text syncTime="2657.125" offset="10778033">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.603" offset="10823904">A lot of the lengthy discussion that has gone on this morning, I think it might be useful to step back for a minute and emphasize a few points about the fundamental principles relative to the cases before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.601" offset="10867894">First, the Court's modern maritime cases consistently have emphasized the virtues of a comparative fault regime, because such a regime tends to allocate responsibility in accordance with fault, and that in turn tends to give all maritime actors an appropriate incentive to avoid accidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.013" offset="10941560">Each of the rules that Mr. Kelley and I have urged would be consistent with that principle, because each ultimately would result in solvent defendants who do not settle being held liable for a share of the total damages proportionate to their share of the fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.751" offset="10996521">The second principle the Court has followed, absent congressional intervention, is a principle of joint and several liability, under which a plaintiff is entitled to receive all of its damages from any single tortfeasor so that the tortfeasors as a group bear the risk that one or more of them are insolvent, or that one or more of them may have some statutory defense to liability, as in Edmonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.876" offset="11080949">Again, neither of the rules that we have urged today would undercut that principle, except in cases where the plaintiff voluntarily chooses to accept from a defendant a sum less than that defendant's proportionate sum of damages... share of damages, and in that case we see no inequity in holding the plaintiff to the burdens as well as the benefits of the bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.967" offset="11153360">Now, we suggest another principle that should guide the Court in deciding the cases today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.221" offset="11174363">A settlement agreement between two parties should not have the effect of altering the liability to the tort claimant of third parties that are not a party to the settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.396" offset="11215114">Now, the position urged by petitioners in this case, adoption of a contribution bar, is the only one of the three principal rules discussed in the briefs that would lead to that anomalous result, and we submit that the opportunities for collusion, together with the alternate ways of resolving the problem, counsel against adopting that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.598" offset="11287839">Now, with respect to the question of collusion, I thought it would be helpful if we explained what we see as the type of collusion that courts are concerned about in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.914" offset="11317096">I think that if you look at a simplified version of the facts in the McDermott case, you can see the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.127" offset="11337994">You have a plaintiff who owns a boat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.411" offset="11355130">A subsidiary of the plaintiff... we can call it Hudson Engineering... designs a device for picking up a very heavy object on the boat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.555" offset="11383760">For one reason or another, the device doesn't work, the object falls, it causes a lot of damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.620" offset="11403927">The plaintiff sues everybody... the people who made everything, the people who did everything, and then one of the defendants--</text>

            <text syncTime="2825.137" offset="11450007">Now, one person who might have some liability is the person who designed the sling that picked up the thing and dropped it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.338" offset="11474876">Now, since that person is... in fact they might have a very large share of the liability, but because that person is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the plaintiff, the plaintiff could enter into a settlement agreement with that party under which that party pays $100,000, even though you might think that the damages are $10 million or $20 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.340" offset="11538823">Now, if you adopt a contribution bar rule with the pro tanto approach, let's say you go to trial, the nonsettling defendants, the parties that aren't related to the plaintiff, there's a verdict for $10 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.448" offset="11587307">Under the contribution bar rule, the verdict is reduced by $100,000 to take account of the settlement with the related party and the plaintiff, and that leaves the nonrelated parties paying $9,900,000 although the jury might have found that they were responsible for, say, 50 percent of the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.587" offset="11651881">That's the type of collusion that we think is unfair.</text>

            <text syncTime="2924.540" offset="11847695">--No, I think that it's useful to explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.862" offset="11864936">The Court has... I think the reason that people try to call that rule the proportionate fault rule is because your cases say that you like proportionate fault, though Reliable Transfer case rejected the flat divided damages rule in favor of what you can call a proportionate or comparative fault regime, which says that everybody is liable for their percentage of the damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.847" offset="11944871">The reason we call it proportionate reduction is because you're reducing the plaintiff's claim proportionately, and if you do adopt that rule in McDermott, then it seems to us there would be no need for a good faith hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.314" offset="11994712">Now, the issue that Justice Souter and several people were talking about towards the end of Mr. Markman's argument, a Mary Carter agreement, that seems to us an entirely separate question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.230" offset="12026373">The issues before the Court today I think have to do with how you account in the claim for the effect of a settlement to one of the tortfeasors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.924" offset="12065138">Now, there are separate common law rules, and I would presume this Court would consider on the proper occasion how to deal with a situation where a plaintiff in one of the tortfeasors enter into an agreement under which the defendant... the settling tortfeasor's going to assist at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.396" offset="12123026">In many States and many common law jurisdictions, the rule is not that that agreement is illegal, the rule is that it is supposed to be presented to the fact-finder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.503" offset="12159493">It's discoverable, it's admissible at trial, the nonsettling defendant comes in and says, don't believe what the settling defendant is saying, he's getting paid to say that, don't listen to him, it's his fault and not mine, and that is a separate rule, and the Court as a matter of its maritime power under Article III could consider adopting such a rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="3049.403" offset="12347052">We're just wondering if we go down the road of proportionate reduction on the theory that that is going to simplify proceedings, are we acting on an assumption which is in fact true, because if we had to... if later on we found that the courts were saddling the proportionate reduction rule with collateral proceedings to look into good faith, we wouldn't have gotten quite as much for our rule as we thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.907" offset="12445168">And I think you're answering that by saying the interest that might lead you to worry, or a court to worry about the terms of the settlement, does not necessarily portend another collateral proceeding, it simply portends a disclosure rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="3172.362" offset="12838885">The reasons why we don't favor that rule first are that it seems to us it would have an adverse effect on settlements, because it's going to take away from the plaintiff the incentive to make a settlement, because if the plaintiff makes a good settlement, he doesn't get the benefit of it, so it certainly is going to decrease the plaintiff's incentive for settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.834" offset="12912864">A second problem with that rule with respect to your concerns is that it doesn't necessarily get rid of the one recovery problem that seems to concern you, because at least as I understood the rule that was proposed, the person would choose immediately after the settlement was made whether they wanted pro rata or pro tanto, so if he chose wrong, the plaintiff still might get more than one recovery, and the third problem with it, it seems to us--</text>

            <text syncTime="3255.667" offset="13172208">I would like to go back over one thing mentioned by Florida Power &amp; Light Company in its presentation, would suggest to the Court that a review of the documents contained in the Joint Appendix with respect to the settlement reached between Boca Grande Club and the Polackwich and Richards claimants will contain representations that in fact the settlements were made for noncollusive purposes and were made in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.022" offset="13273563">We would also note that this Court has recently approved changes to Rule 11 that in the Federal procedure, since we and the claimants in that case submitted documents to the court signed by counsel which represented that they were being submitted to the court for appropriate purposes, would probably... could probably lead to sanctions if in fact it later turned out that the claimants had procured the cooperation unduly of Boca Grande Club or its employees, and that wasn't disclosed in the settlement papers submitted to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.823" offset="13404802">We would also submit that there has been some discussion about collusive situations, and I think the Court needs to distinguish between collusive situations which is what we've talked about, whereby as part of the settlement agreement the settling party agrees to cooperate with, however that may be, in presenting the case against the nonsettling party and enhancing or assisting the plaintiff outside of the normal court processes, and the normal trial practice of the empty chair.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.445" offset="13535310">It is an anathema to plaintiff's counsel to have an empty chair, and it is the ideal situation for the defense counsel to have somebody to point to who isn't in court that can be suggested as the more culpable party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.103" offset="13589853">We would suggest that any requirement for a good faith hearing be limited to... under a pro tanto situation to an examination to determine the collusive effects, and even in the Federal court system we would suggest that the Rule 11 would pose severe concerns to a counsel who participated in a collusive agreement and then obtained a dismissal from a U.S. district court based on some pleadings submitted to that court that it turned out resulted in a collusive effect at the trial which later took place, and I would submit that certainly the nonsettling defendant would be well aware of what happened later at the trial.</text>
