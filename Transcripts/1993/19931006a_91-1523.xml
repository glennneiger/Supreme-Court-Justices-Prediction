            <text syncTime="12.870" offset="202625">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.871" offset="210671">In the Burlington decision, this Court recognized that one of the judicial remedies available for a school district's failure to provide an education meeting the requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is reimbursement of the child's parents for the cost of removing their child from the public school and putting he or she into a private school that provides an education that is proper under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.277" offset="304294">The Court in Burlington explained that conclusion in part on the ground that where parents select a private school placement that is found to be "proper under the act" the award of such reimbursement does nothing more than pay the parents the cost that should have been paid initially by the public school for the placement that should have been provided in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.259" offset="388199">The issue presented in this case is whether, as the court below held, this right to reimbursement under Burlington arises wherever the private placement selected by the parents ultimately proves to be beneficial to the child, or rather, whether such placements are constrained, as are all other placements under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act by the obligation to provide a free appropriate public education, which is defined precisely and specifically in the act.</text>

            <text syncTime="288.700" offset="1305933">So you seem in that passage to be recognizing that there are cases where there can be deviations from both the IEP requirement, the FAPE educational standards, so doesn't this controversy, then, boil down to whether this case fits that description?</text>

            <text syncTime="348.700" offset="1545946">If they have such a list, in all likelihood, it's going to be necessary for the parents to go to somebody and ask for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.291" offset="1564336">If there is no list, it is in the same way necessary for the parents to go to someone, perhaps, and ask the question, here's what I'd like to do under my Burlington rights, I want to put the child in a private school, can you tell me whether this facility meets standards?</text>
            <text syncTime="367.851" offset="1622537">We would have a different case here if what had happened was the parents had done that and been given either no answer, or been given an answer which is, we won't cooperate with you, we won't help you.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.268" offset="1668199">That might be a case where you could say that the realization of the free appropriate public education simply couldn't realistically be accomplished here even though the parents tried to do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1659.875" offset="6790707">Before we get into the issues, I'd like to take a moment to review some of the factual questions that are important in responding to Mr. Ayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.990" offset="6823098">In 1983, when Shannon was 13 years old, she entered the seventh grade at Timmonsville School.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.625" offset="6849639">Her mother told the school officials that Shannon could not read and requested that she be evaluated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.508" offset="6869178">The school system evaluated her, concluded that she was lazy, unmotivated, a slow learner who needed to be pressured harder to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.423" offset="6900839">Relying upon that, the parents pressured their daughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.396" offset="6912751">By February of 1985, she was 16, functionally illiterate, had become suicidal, and was severely depressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.900" offset="6942739">Her parents obtained counseling for her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.873" offset="6950680">The counselor recommended that Shannon receive a complete psychological evaluation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.004" offset="6967190">The results found that Shannon had a severe learning disability and intense educational services were recommended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.699" offset="6993939">Following this, the school did evaluate Shannon and concurred that Shannon had a severe learning disability and was average to above average in intelligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.904" offset="7026749">At a conference with parents and school personnel, an individualized educational program was presented to the parents that proposed a resource program for Shannon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.620" offset="7061649">This resource class would be one where Shannon was going to be placed with emotionally disturbed and mentally retarded children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.774" offset="7086308">The parents said that was not appropriate for Shannon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.776" offset="7098220">The school then offered an itinerant program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.467" offset="7108983">This program consisted of 3 hours of special education a week, and after a year in the tenth grade as a 17-year-old, her reading still would have remained at the fifth grade level, and she would have fallen further and further behind her peer group.</text>

            <text syncTime="1769.286" offset="7228310">The parents said that was not... inadequate, and based upon the advice of the evaluators that were working with the family and with Shannon, requested at that time a self-contained learning disabled program such as the one that was offered right down the road in Florence County School District One.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.368" offset="7292676">Now, Florence County has multiple school districts, and this is a case against District Four, not against Florence County itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1796.335" offset="7336457">The parents then requested a special education due process hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.258" offset="7352235">At the August 20 due process hearing, the Carters requested funding for either two neighboring schools or Trident Academy, a special educational school accredited by the Southern... excuse me, Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.205" offset="7412003">The issue at the special education due process hearing and before the district court judge was whether or not District Four's itinerant program was appropriate.</text>

            <label>Ms. Amy L. Wax</label>
            <text syncTime="2666.672" offset="10817848">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.750" offset="10862152">Under the broad remedial provision of this statute, a judge is allowed to award any remedy that he deems appropriate, and as this Court said in the Burlington case, appropriate means appropriate in light of the purpose of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.789" offset="10922338">We think that the answer to this case and the answer to many of the questions that the justices have posed today comes in asking the right question, and that question is, what is the purpose of this statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.587" offset="10969463">What is its aim?</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.819" offset="10974478">Why did Congress enact the IDEA?</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.662" offset="10989838">Congress enacted IDEA to provide a basic floor of educational opportunity for disabled children, to ensure that those children received an education that was calculated to enable them to receive benefit, and in deciding what remedies are appropriate, we believe that basic equitable principles dictate that the legal standard should be no more onerous and no more complicated than are absolutely necessary to effectuate the statutory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.040" offset="11103314">Now, with respect to the questions that Justice Ginsburg have raised about whether parents have to make reasonable inquiries or reasonable efforts to comply with the particulars of section 1401, or whether they have to choose a school from a list, the position of the United States is that no such per se requirements should be imposed as a rigid matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.726" offset="11198086">There should be no requirement as such that parents make inquiries, and the reason for this, first of all, is that the statute contains no such requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.941" offset="11238942">There is no explicit mandate that parents make inquiries, seek information, confer and consult endlessly before they may challenge the IEP proposed and received a remedy.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="2783.899" offset="11286798">Of course, they always have an incentive to ask for a list anyway, or to select a school from a list that is provided, a very considerable incentive, don't they?</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.645" offset="11325773">That is to say, if the school district has provided a list, you know that you can get reimbursement so long as you pick one of those schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="2800.251" offset="11352209">Well, it certainly increases your chances of getting reimbursement, Justice Scalia, but part of our point is that just because you choose a school from a list doesn't mean you satisfy the substantive showing that it's appropriate for your child.</text>

            <text syncTime="2854.465" offset="11569025">Correct, and they could contest that, too, and those are the two elements of the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.027" offset="11583236">Now, it's important to realize that every time you set up a requirement like, the parent has to make inquiries, the parent has to look at a list, that requirement comes at a cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.774" offset="11630256">It comes at a cost to the parents and the children seeking a remedy, and that's because although it may seem simple to ask parents to pick up the phone and call the school district, as this Court recognized in Burlington, the reply that they're likely to get is, we'll get back to you, we'll look into it, call back next week, when the right person is here, and that produces delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.449" offset="11720953">And when there's delay, the parents are in a quandary, because each day that the child is in an inappropriate and unsatisfactory setting, is a day that's lost to the education of that child, and it also produces uncertainty, because the parents ask themselves, how much of an effort is enough, how much of an official response is sufficient, when can we cut our losses and move our child, and all of those uncertainties get played out at the remedial phase of the statute, when the judge is asked to consider how much effort is enough, whether what the school district did is equitably sufficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="2926.493" offset="11857103">Ms. Wax, we're going back now to the setting in the school system and not when we're in court talking about the parents' choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.299" offset="11900362">In the school system, isn't the thrust of the act that the parents and the school authority should be trying to work with each other to the maximum extent possible, rather than an incentive for the parents to pull that child out of the public school system quickly and put it in some superior private school?</text>

            <label>Ms. Amy L. Wax</label>
            <text syncTime="2957.521" offset="11981237">Your Honor, that overstates the statutory interest in having parents and school districts consult and confer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.317" offset="12008405">That interest in mutual cooperation is fully exhausted by coming together to try and formulate an IEP in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.133" offset="12043722">Once that proposal is signed and sealed and proposed, then under the statute parents have no openended obligation to consult and confer without end, and in fact as this Court recognized in Burlington, to incorporate such a requirement would be very much to the disadvantage of parents, because the school district always has the upper hand in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.935" offset="12122925">On the contrary, under section 1415 of the act, the parents have an immediate right to challenge the adequacy of the IEP, to challenge any aspect of the school district's proposal at the administrative level, first by directing the challenge to the school district itself, then with appeal to the State, and finally, judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.670" offset="12201815">So I think petitioners vastly overstate the statutory interest in consultation and cooperation, and if their proposal was adopted, it would work to the detriment of the parents and the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.456" offset="12253015">So the point is that the requirement that parents choose from a list, which vastly reduces their options for providing their child's education, and that they inquire of the school district, creates tremendous obstacles and complications to their receiving relief, and the question is, the equitable question is, do those added complications come at some benefit to the effectuation of the statutory purpose, and the answer has to be no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.976" offset="12359072">The statutory purpose is fully effectuated when a judge determines whether in a particular case the education that the child received in the parent's chosen institution was an appropriate education within the meaning of Rowley.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.124" offset="12415706">That is, it accomplished the purpose of the act, which was to provide a basic floor of educational opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.088" offset="12439529">And if the education lives up to that standard, then consideration of whether the school's on a list, or whether inquiries were made, or whether certain formalities were complied with, really becomes superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.675" offset="12489894">They become beside the point, and in that case it would effectuate the statutory purpose to allow reimbursement, and it certainly would defeat the statutory purpose to deny reimbursement.</text>
