            <text syncTime="12.879" offset="203478">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.902" offset="215495">This case arises out of the purchase by a purchase... the purchase by a pension plan of an insurance policy to provide guaranteed annuities to plan participants and beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.940" offset="267635">Under the provisions of the contract, the premiums paid are paid into John Hancock's general account and become part of Hancock's general corporate assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.156" offset="308491">The fundamental issue in this case is whether Hancock's general corporate assets are also to be considered assets of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.331" offset="341196">Hancock unquestionably exercises authority and control over the management of its own corporate assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.168" offset="372543">If any of those assets are also deemed to be plan assets, then Hancock would be a fiduciary under ERISA and under ERISA's fiduciary rules would be required to manage its corporate assets, or at least a part of them, solely in the interest of the plan's participants and beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.338" offset="441297">Congress specifically addressed contracts issued by insurance companies to pension plans in ERISA section 401(b)(2), and that section can be found at page A-94 of the Appendix to the Petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.738" offset="506917">It is referenced there as 29 U.S. Code section 1101(b)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="95.384" offset="533457">In substance, that section states that in the case of a guaranteed benefit policy issued to a plan, the contract itself is a plan asset, but the insurance company's assets are not plan assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.523" offset="593957">The Second Circuit concluded in this case, the GAC 50, the contract in issue, is, in part at least, a guaranteed benefit policy within the meaning of section 401(b)(2), and that Hancock is not a fiduciary to the extent that guaranteed benefits have already been purchased by the trustee under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.836" offset="675250">That court went on to hold, however, that Hancock should be considered to be a fiduciary with respect to what the court referred to as the contract's free funds.</text>

            <text syncTime="146.136" offset="736481">Hancock and the Government take the position that Hancock is not a fiduciary at all with respect to its corporate assets because Harris Trust, as the plan trustee, has at all times had the right under GAC 50 to purchase additional guaranteed benefits to the full extent of the contract's so-called free funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.120" offset="816416">The contract in its entirety, therefore, is a guaranteed benefit policy under section 401(b)(2).</text>

            <text syncTime="237.427" offset="1101673">And among those options, of course, was the ability to use the so-called free funds to purchase or to provide so-called nonguaranteed benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="248.185" offset="1144618">Does John Hancock, in issuing policies to plans like this, ever issue anything that might be called an insurance contract that does not provide for some guaranteed benefit?</text>

            <text syncTime="309.835" offset="1391214">And I could visualize, though I don't believe any such contract has ever existed, that it would provide for variable benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1143.247" offset="4724856">If I can respond first to Justice Ginsburg's question about whether our position would be any different if the Senate bill had been passed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1154.987" offset="4771877">The Senate bill very clearly provided that general account assets are not plan assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.871" offset="4795387">The conference committee rewrote the provision in its present form, and we believe that it made the following modest change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.805" offset="4831123">It provided that to the extent that a general account plan could be used to provide variable benefits, something that is... that was and is highly unusual, that to that extent it would not be a guaranteed benefit policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1189.640" offset="4910430">Well, there's one important exception which is illustrated in the 1978 advisory opinion that we've referenced, that's the College Retirement Equities Fund in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.384" offset="4949405">Since 1952 it has provided variable annuities out of a general account, and in 1978 it went to the Department of Labor for confirmation that it was not a fiduciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.454" offset="5009696">Because the Department had earlier said, somewhat echoing the language of the Senate bill, that general account assets are not plan assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.779" offset="5043028">When the Department in 1978 was faced with the example of CREF, the College Retirement Equities fund, and realized that there was this exception under which variable annuities could be paid from general account contracts, it then recognized that, no, CREF was a fiduciary in that circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.051" offset="5116066">And if I could take 1 minute to explain why... why that Labor thought that that was an important distinction and why Congress might well have thought that was an important distinction, I'd really like to explain that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.950" offset="5163714">If variable annuities are paid, then the amount that pensioners receive depends on how the general account is performing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.907" offset="5195583">It seems clear that Congress would want an insurance company to be a fiduciary in that circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.061" offset="5228184">It's different with gen... with group annuity contracts paying fixed benefits like those here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.665" offset="5250545">The pensioners have been promised fixed benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.206" offset="5260785">In the case of those pensioners whose benefits have already been guaranteed, they will receive monthly payments for the rest of their lives from John Hancock, no matter how long they live and no matter how the general account performs.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence Kill</label>
            <text syncTime="1700.313" offset="6953206">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.815" offset="6971178">In the case of an insurance carrier, the statute tells us exactly what is covered and what is not covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.992" offset="7003883">It is not necessary to go beyond the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.061" offset="7016109">The statute does not define plan assets except in the case of an insurance carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.887" offset="7043485">And in the case of an insurance carrier, the definition of plan assets is anything other than a guaranteed benefit policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.873" offset="7079429">We all agree that guaranteed benefits are exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.686" offset="7102626">Our position is that variable benefits or variable payments to a plan are plan assets and subject to ERISA's fiduciary duty rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.325" offset="7153199">The language of the statute is an effort by Congress to make certain that the traditional or standard annuity... where pension funds are given to a carrier in exchange for a promise to pay specified benefits at a specific time in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.478" offset="7225820">Congress was exempting the traditional standard annuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.459" offset="7241702">In Peoria, Jude Posner makes that analysis and I think it follows from a reading of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.193" offset="7264690">Guaranteed benefits are exempt; everything else is within the four corners of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.008" offset="7291962">The definition of fiduciary is functional, and you look at a person's activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.533" offset="7322055">The activities here by Hancock are specified in a contract which is labeled guaranteed benefits, nonguaranteed benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.559" offset="7362179">Two different distinct promises are made and were made in 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.651" offset="7382554">The payment of guaranteed benefits has nothing to do with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.514" offset="7398019">The payment of nonguarantees has everything to do with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.958" offset="7411707">It was understood that Hand could... Hancock would invest pension funds in order to... in order to create money for the payment of nonguaranteed benefits, if sought by the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.876" offset="7467400">In this case the plan demanded that Hancock use the excess funds for the payment of nonguaranteed benefits and Hancock said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.092" offset="7504285">In 1982 they turned off the spigot and said we can't use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.195" offset="7524661">Can we have it back?</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.597" offset="7530303">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.388" offset="7533438">What can we do with it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.507" offset="7537931">Nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.348" offset="7541274">Until 1988 when the nonguaranteed portion had risen from $18 million to in excess of $55 million, the plan was frustrated in its ability to use those excess funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.566" offset="7594146">In 1988, Hancock finally agreed to a plan amendment which allowed us to withdraw almost $55 million of free funds... a term coined by Hancock, not the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.174" offset="7644615">Under that amendment we could withdraw it without suffering the penalty of contract termination and the repurchase of annuities and, in effect, convert the contract into a deferred annuity contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.633" offset="7694456">Now, the question as to whether the $55 million, when in the possession of Hancock, was not free funds but the moment it was transferred it became free funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.910" offset="7731550">Now, Hancock's position in this case is a resurrection of the Senate bill, plain, simple resurrection of the Senate bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.354" offset="7761330">The DOL recognizes that that does not make any sense and Congress must have something else in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.289" offset="7789020">And as a guess, and they say it's a guess, they sought to close a large loophole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.632" offset="7810440">That is the sale of variable annuities out of the general account.</text>

            <text syncTime="3233.765" offset="13086966">But if I may finish the answer, because 75-2, upon which the Department seeks deference through today, so-called settled expectations, is not factual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.442" offset="13129702">First of all, they issued advisory opinions that are fundamentally in conflict with Interpretive Bulletin 75-2.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.266" offset="13156974">They told the Second Circuit they did not have a position; that it was very important, very complex.</text>

            <text syncTime="3303.449" offset="13365745">But you look at the thoroughness, the reasoning, the consistency, and the persuasiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.623" offset="13382358">In light of the history, I think that the DOL has not established any of these elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.738" offset="13406914">They... as late as last year telling the Second Circuit they did not have a position.</text>

            <text syncTime="3319.431" offset="13429588">The position today is fundamentally inconsistent with IB 75-2, upon which they rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.344" offset="13453307">They said... IB 75-2 was intended to give a blanket exemption, like the Senate bill, to insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.009" offset="13483923">Today they stand up and say no, this was intended to cover variable annuities sold out of general accounts, even though that's illegal in all 50 States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.365" offset="13513389">But those are two inconsistent positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.527" offset="13526032">The DOL has not made a consistent position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.288" offset="13537108">They have, in fact, supported the trustee on numerous occasions in advisory opinions and in other ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.562" offset="13566156">And if you read their brief, except for the bottom line they're very supportive of Harris Trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.056" offset="13584128">They point out that our position has merit, that it would protect pensioners, it would protect plans against... it said added significant... significant is their word... legal protections to protect plans against losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.905" offset="13635537">That is what ERISA is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.905" offset="13643583">So the history of the Department's interpretation of this statute has been ambiguous, not the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.643" offset="13682453">And I dare say today their interpretation is fundamentally at odds with the meaning of the statute.</text>
