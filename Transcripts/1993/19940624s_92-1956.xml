            <text syncTime="6.392" offset="116514">The first decision that I have to announce is No. 92-1956, Consolidated Rail Corporation versus Gottshall which comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.951" offset="186731">I have this along with a companion case that the Circuit also ruled on, Consolidated Rail Corporation versus Carlisle.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.842" offset="226332">Respondents, James Gottshall and Alan Carlisle, each sued their former employer, petitioner Conrail for negligent infliction of emotional distress under the Federal Employers' Liability Act or FELA.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.825" offset="294251">That is a statue that provides remedies to railroad workers injured through the negligence of their employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.003" offset="330927">In Gottshall's case which stemmed from an incident in which Gottshall witnessed a close friend under rather strain circumstances and co-worker die of a heart attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.294" offset="384112">The District Court granted summary judgment to Conrail.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.495" offset="400935">The Third Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.585" offset="409294">The court noted that State Courts have developed several tests in order to limit recovery for emotional injury, but reasoned that these common law tests must be disregarded when they bar recovery of valid FELA claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.632" offset="481496">The court held that a suit for negligent infliction of emotional distress under FELA must alleged facts sufficient to assure the genuiness of a claim as well as the usual tort elements including foreseeability.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.427" offset="536667">Satisfied that Gottshall's claims had met these threshold burdens, the court remanded for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.052" offset="567178">Carlisle sued Conrail for emotional injury from work-related stress.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.268" offset="596017">The jury awarded him nearly $400,000 in damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.774" offset="614094">The Third Circuit affirmed concluding that Carlisle had produced sufficient evidence that his stress-related injuries were genuine and had been foreseeable to Conrail.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.780" offset="662055">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse the judgments below.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.606" offset="681385">We agree with the Third Circuit that employers have a duty under FELA to avoid negligently inflict emotional distress upon their employees, but we reject the lower court's definition of the scope of that duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.198" offset="739795">The Third Circuit disregarded the common law's treatment of the right of recovery pursued by respondents and created a standard that would in effect, make railroads, the insurers of the emotional well-beings of their employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.318" offset="800190">Our case has established, however, that FELA is not an insurance statute but a negligent statute and what constitutes negligence for the purposes of FELA cannot be ascertained without reference to common law principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.479" offset="860899">We adapt the common law zone of danger test for evaluating claims for negligent infliction of emotional distress brought under FELA.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.450" offset="900814">This test best reconciles without FELA jurisprudence, the concerns underlying the common law restrictions on emotional injury claims the potential for a flood of trivial or fraudulent suits and the possibility of unpredictable and unlimited liability for defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.606" offset="981376">Under this test, a railroad worker within the zone of danger of physical impact due to his employer's negligence will be able to recover for emotional injury caused by fear of physical injury to himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.804" offset="1038218">The zone of danger test had been adapted by a significant number of states at the time FELA was enacted in 1908, and it currently is followed in 14 jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.671" offset="1089627">It, therefore, is a well-established common law principle suitable for delimiting the duty of railroads to avoid inflicting emotional injuries upon their workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.997" offset="1134976">We remand Gottshall's case to the Third Circuit for reconsideration in light of the zone of danger test announced today.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.303" offset="1168203">In Carlisle's case, however, we remand with instructions to enter judgment for Conrail.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.256" offset="1192027">Claims arising from work-related stress are not compensable under the common law zone of danger test nor are they cognizable under FELA.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.295" offset="1232151">Justice Souter has filed a concurring opinion; Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Blackmun and Justice Stevens have joined.</text>
