            <text syncTime="18.803" offset="256728">Mr. Klein.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joel I. Klein</label>
            <text syncTime="20.496" offset="263520">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="23.247" offset="274491">The district court incorrectly held that Florida's legislative districting plan violates section 2 of the Voting Rights Act by diluting the votes of Hispanics living in Dade County.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.552" offset="315765">The Florida plan provides Dade County Hispanics with a proportional share of majority districts, and we submit that such an allocation necessarily gives them the same opportunity as others to elect voters, to elect representatives of their choice, which is all that section 2, by its terms, requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.757" offset="400611">The United States agrees with us that proportionality is sufficient, but it argues that we must show proportionality with respect to all Hispanics in Florida, not just those living in Dade County.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.485" offset="451497">But the problem with that argument is that it's flatly inconsistent with this Court's decision in Gingles, which held that any group claiming vote dilution must show that it is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.417" offset="519207">In Florida, there's only one such group of Hispanics who can meet that threshold requirement, and those are the Hispanics living in Dade County, and they, as I've said, already have proportional representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.675" offset="568212">The remaining Hispanics in Florida are so geographically diverse that it is impossible to construct anything remotely resembling a compact district in which they could be a majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.622" offset="616069">Now, the United States' response is, well, you can create more districts for Hispanics in Dade County.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.275" offset="642609">But that simply misses the point of Gingles, which is, in the absence of compactness, the State plan simply doesn't dilute Hispanic votes, and therefore there's no violation under section 2 and no remedial districts in any location are required.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.819" offset="716797">The United States' argument also has the other problem of being incompatible with the text of section 2, which protects a right to elect representatives, not a right to have representatives elected by others of the same race who may live hundreds of miles away in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.860" offset="788999">A concept that the United States calls, quote, virtual representation, but which is nowhere mentioned in the statute, legislative history, or numerous decisions of this Court addressing section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.597" offset="835915">So, if I can, let me state the principle that we think governs the appeal, and that is that a State plan satisfies section 2 if it provides a proportional share of majority districts to each geographically compact group of minorities, something that the Florida plan indisputably does.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.592" offset="919925">If I might, now, let me return--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="187.583" offset="931837">Mr. Klein, I assume that you are asking us to reject this notion of the Statewide frame of reference totally, for this case and for every case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joel_i_klein" startTime="195.488" stopTime="228.720">
            <label>Mr. Joel I. Klein</label>
            <text syncTime="195.488" offset="963497">--I think you have to reject it in the following sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.810" offset="976767">Unless you can show reasonable geographic compactness throughout the State, which you might be able to show in a case like Bandemer where there were 59 percent Democrats or Republicans.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.768" offset="1016578">Unless you can show that, I think you have to reject it and I think Gingles requires it.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.371" offset="1030998">So I think that is my position.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.492" offset="1039566">And, indeed, I would suggest to the Court, if one looks at the array of voting rights cases, from '65 forward, frankly, they are always brought locale by locale.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.937" offset="1073316">They may be a multidistrict situation, but they're not brought in a Statewide basis for precisely this reason.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="228.720" offset="1096408">Well, even... I had thought perhaps a Statewide basis was the proper focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.575" offset="1123889">But if the proof at trial of those complaining is limited to, as it was in this case, Dade County, I'm not sure that we need to go beyond that now.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joel_i_klein" startTime="248.773" stopTime="256.878">
            <label>Mr. Joel I. Klein</label>
            <text syncTime="248.773" offset="1176656">I agree with you, Justice O'Connor, that the proof in this case was limited to Dade County.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.876" offset="1197032">And I think it's sufficient to dispose of this appeal.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="256.878" stopTime="258.339">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="256.878" offset="1209048">And that's enough to dispose of the case, is it not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joel_i_klein" startTime="258.339" stopTime="289.101">
            <label>Mr. Joel I. Klein</label>
            <text syncTime="258.339" offset="1214900">It is.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.901" offset="1217198">I do want to make the added point... it absolutely enough, but I do want to make the added point that there would be no possible reason for a remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.294" offset="1246769">Because it's not just a failure of proof, it's that you cannot prove geographical compactness, a fact that the United States concedes by suggesting that you basically concentrate additional districts in Dade County.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.953" offset="1297342">But I think you're exactly right, Justice O'Connor, and that's why I'd like to start with the district court's opinion, which, after all, is the case that brought us up here on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.439" offset="1331301">And make no mistake about it--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="289.101" offset="1337989">And the proof, by everybody, basically focused on Dade County.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joel_i_klein" startTime="293.313" stopTime="428.860">
            <label>Mr. Joel I. Klein</label>
            <text syncTime="293.313" offset="1354811">--Absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.964" offset="1357424">The United States contests otherwise, but I think there's no support in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.385" offset="1375082">First of all, the district court's opinion, of course, talks only about Dade County.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.130" offset="1394100">It made the Gingles compactness, the Gingles cohesion, and the Gingles white-bloc voting findings in Dade County.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.284" offset="1426700">It found vote dilution of voters in Dade County.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.117" offset="1442060">The United States went first.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.178" offset="1450211">They had the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.150" offset="1454181">They put on evidence only about Dade County.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.552" offset="1467765">We moved for a directed verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.422" offset="1475288">They said they proved Gingles in Dade County.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.435" offset="1487304">It seems to me that on that record the only issue is vote dilution in Dade County.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.358" offset="1511024">Now, as to that, which the district court, in fairness, did address.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.711" offset="1524398">Where its error is is in its notion that somehow proportionality isn't a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.525" offset="1547700">The district court said, look, we applied Gingles two and three, and we find that there's cohesion and white-bloc voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.729" offset="1580509">We can create more districts than the State did in Dade County, and so we're going to impose 11 rather than 9 districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.154" offset="1614155">That is, of course, a maximization principle, and it would apply equally well to any municipality.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.678" offset="1636307">If you had a city council with five people on there and you had a 40 percent minority in the city, if they lived compactly you could create, just as a matter of math, three out of five districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.417" offset="1687193">It happens every time.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.819" offset="1692836">Now, our submission would be section 2 obviously doesn't require that.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.091" offset="1709868">Where the district court went wrong is in thinking that you don't have to temper the Gingles factors by a proportionality finding, something that the Court in Gingles itself obviously did.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.787" offset="1756679">And the reason that is, is section 2 provides a comparative standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.621" offset="1772039">In other words, you have to have the same opportunity as others.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.284" offset="1786668">Well, when you create 11 out of 18 districts in Dade County that are majority Hispanic, you are diminishing the opportunity of white voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.189" offset="1826269">That's exactly how you do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.732" offset="1832434">And therefore, what you've done is you've created a far greater opportunity for Hispanic voters than you would for white voters, and that's not what the statute requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.088" offset="1869946">So I think proportionality is an absolute touchstone, it has to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.320" offset="1886873">Now, the De Grandy people--</text>

            <text syncTime="450.436" offset="1983318">That is to say in order to... I think this Court in Gingles said the following, and I think this is exactly right, that Gingles stands for the proposition that a large, cohesive, compact... large, cohesive, compact majority does have a right to proportional representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.647" offset="2060118">That's what Gingles says is the equal opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.790" offset="2068686">Now, that means not mandated proportionality, as the United States says.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.991" offset="2085509">You've got to show large, compact, and cohesive.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.654" offset="2100137">In this case where there was large, compact, and cohesive, we gave them proportionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.337" offset="2118945">Whether less than proportionality would have sufficed under the statute is an issue not presented by this case, because everyone concedes in Dade County that there is proportionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.594" offset="2159905">And our only point is that in order to preserve the equal opportunity language, you have to accept proportionality as an upper limit in terms of what the statute requires, whether the State--</text>

            <text syncTime="1027.922" offset="4293273">That is, what our submission is is the failure of the United States to prove cohesion Statewide under its terms, means that it hasn't stated a Statewide claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.201" offset="4346354">It says in order to show a Statewide claim, you'd have to prove cohesion Statewide and white-bloc voting State-wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.134" offset="4374044">We say it never proved either of those things, and a result of that it cannot prove up the very claim that it is seeking to advance in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.552" offset="4415736">However, even if it could prove up both of those points, it would still fail because it failed to prove the first Gingles factor of compactness on a Statewide basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.501" offset="4463592">Instead, what it did was basically to run directly to something the statute disavows, and that is proportional representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.584" offset="4495879">It said we don't care where Hispanics live, their vote is diluted unless they get more districts in Dade County because they're entitled to Statewide proportionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.772" offset="4540601">I think that is so flatly inconsistent with Gingles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.725" offset="4556483">The United States says, well Gingles is just a question of remedy, can you fit these in.</text>

            <text syncTime="1152.714" offset="4792421">Therefore it seems to me, in drawing district lines you have to take into account these communities of interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1169.434" offset="4859295">That is they were... we've never disputed that those criteria are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.466" offset="4871416">Now, I think a very different question would be done if a State, for example, took a computer and simply, truly drew circles on a map as a way of drawing lines and in no way took into account race.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.836" offset="4924914">But in practicality, Justice Kennedy, States do take into account community interests, including both white and black and religious and otherwise, and as long as you are reasonably compact, as Hispanics in Dade County are, we think that's what the Voting Rights contemplates... Act contemplates, and that's reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.754" offset="4988549">So we are not unhappy with proportionality as a solution here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.199" offset="5006312">We think it's a fair one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.629" offset="5012059">It's just when the United States decides to say that there are another few hundred thousand Hispanics who are dispersed over another 12 million people in Florida and we have to give them proportional representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.208" offset="5062423">That, we think, can't be countenanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.040" offset="5069737">And we think, finally, in that regard... let me just make two last points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.642" offset="5088127">One, it seems to me the proof of the pudding here is in the bizarre result the United States is forced to embrace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.088" offset="5121878">Understand, in order to get to 11 House and 4 Senate seats in Dade County, they have to bring in voters all over... actually people all over the State of Florida into their case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.426" offset="5179242">And then what do they say?</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.748" offset="5184571">Not that those voters get a chance to vote for anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.259" offset="5194602">Those voters cannot vote in these minority districts, but people in Dade County who already have a proportional group of representatives, they're going to get extra people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.248" offset="5242563">And the United States says, well, that's because all these people of the same race have a common interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.052" offset="5265760">But that seems to me to be a concept so repudiated by this Court's decisions and by the so-called proportionality proviso in section 2 itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.208" offset="5310377">So I think that is an argument that really falls of its own weight.</text>

            <text syncTime="1535.924" offset="6325287">Now, what I submit is if you have 7 plus percent of the electorate, of the citizens, and you've got 7 plus percent of the seats, then you have exactly the same opportunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1585.387" offset="6523086">It will always be the case that when you're measuring whether a group is under or over represented within a larger jurisdiction, there will be some parts of the jurisdiction where the minority group is under represented and other parts of the jurisdiction where it's over represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.554" offset="6575749">The whole point of looking at this to determine whether the minority group has an equal opportunity to participate and elect, is to determine when you look at those electoral opportunities divided up over the jurisdiction as a whole, of whether it's equal.</text>

            <text syncTime="4477.555" offset="18091778">You can have Hispanics in North Florida who are Democrats who get outvoted by Republican whites.</text>

            <text syncTime="4498.610" offset="18175997">Outside of Dade County there's one other House member in the State of Florida who's Hispanic.</text>
            <text syncTime="4504.682" offset="18200238">He was elected in Hillsborough County, the Tampa area, all right.</text>

            <text syncTime="4740.928" offset="19145244">Now, in fact, the question that came up is if you assumed 20 percent blacks in that group and you have five seats, then if you had 12 percent of the blacks in a compact group they could constitute a majority in one of five.</text>

            <text syncTime="4760.591" offset="19223925">--Absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="4761.081" offset="19225910">Because you cannot... the State's drawing compact single district lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="4765.564" offset="19243778">That's exactly what the Court says in Gingles itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4769.097" offset="19257884">In drawing a line... let's just think of the map as we draw it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4772.749" offset="19272513">Here you have a group.</text>
            <text syncTime="4774.189" offset="19278260">Let's say you have 5 percent of blacks who live in one part of this large county, and the other 15 percent are dispersed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4782.815" offset="19312846">You cannot draw a single-district map that would give them a majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4788.289" offset="19334684">It can't be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="4789.671" offset="19340222">You've got to give them a gerrymander of extreme proportion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4793.414" offset="19355164">If that's true, the question is under section 2, what is the State procedure or standard that's diluting their vote?</text>
            <text syncTime="4800.897" offset="19385153">And the Court in Gingles says there is none because the lines can't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4805.591" offset="19403961">So I submit to you at a minimum... and that's why I think it's called the precondition... if a group of minorities, of any group of minorities, if that group cannot make up a majority within a compact single district, they have no vote dilution claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="4820.609" offset="19463938">Their vote, if it's diluted so to speak, is diluted not by the State but by geography, and section 2 doesn't address it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4828.486" offset="19495494">The last point I'd make before I sit down is you notice nobody mentioned the issue of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="4833.388" offset="19515138">And the reason is whatever else is said, there is Statewide proportionality on the basis of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="4840.213" offset="19542410">And the statute, clear as it can be, refers to citizens, not to population.</text>
