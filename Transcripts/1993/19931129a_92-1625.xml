            <text syncTime="381.227" offset="1666914">The opinion in Gompers talks about the rules being rules of constitutional import having to do with, as the phrase in the case, substantive rights and constitutional privileges.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.682" offset="1752804">And certainly Hicks v. Fiat comes out of the California courts and applies the same rules and the pivotal case for our purposes here, Bloom v. Illinois, is a constitutional case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2536.361" offset="10287531">This Court's cases have steadily recognized, and I think everybody in this case agrees, that the traditional use of civil contempt to coerce a recalcitrant party or witness into doing something that the court wants them to do, traditionally by putting him in jail until he does it, more recently by fines that accumulate until he or she does it, that that's constitutional, whether done in a State or Federal court.</text>

I think the central question in this case, as Justice Ginsburg mentioned at the outset of the argument, is with prohibitory injunctions, where do we draw the line between those which are constitutional and those which are not?</text>

            <text syncTime="2610.477" offset="10583968">One the Court has explicitly recognized over and over again, and that is that civil contempt can be used in civil litigation to compensate a party for damages done to that party by the other party who violates the injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2751.979" offset="11149990">I think there are at least two categories of cases where civil contempt can be used by a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.173" offset="11166708">One is where it's used to compensate one of the parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="2777.638" offset="11252598">On tort proceedings which are civil, you can have even punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.749" offset="11269003">So the use of civil contempt in that situation, the Court has recognized over and over again that the compensatory use of civil contempt is also constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.915" offset="11301709">There's a second category which I think is closer to this case, and which is, I think, the leading example of it, is the National Labor Relations Board's use of civil contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.742" offset="11344967">As this Court has recognized over and over again, there are areas of regulation of conduct that the Government may proceed in civilly rather than criminally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.399" offset="11383629">The Court's OSHA cases show that, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.311" offset="11395332">As I said, the Court's National Labor Relations Board cases show that most prominently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.755" offset="11417065">Where the Court has said, for example, in Republic Steel, the Act is essentially remedial; it does not carry a penal program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.669" offset="11444755">It is perfectly constitutional for a legislature to decide to regulate something civilly, and labor relations are one of the prime areas where that is possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.906" offset="11481640">So the National Labor Relations Board could constitutionally be given the power itself to levy civil penalties for violations of the Act.</text>
