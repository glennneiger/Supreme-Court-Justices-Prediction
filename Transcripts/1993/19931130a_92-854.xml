            <text syncTime="15.170" offset="208218">The two central issues that you are faced with today are whether Congress intended to create a private cause of action for aiding and abetting under 10(b), and secondly, if you so conclude, whether or not recklessness can provide a sufficient level of scienter, even though there is no duty breached either to disclose, or a duty of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.035" offset="295676">Resolutions of these issues is shaped by the unique features of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.337" offset="312917">Specifically, Central Bank was not sued as a primary violator who allegedly engaged in deceptive or manipulative practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.154" offset="352205">Instead, Central Bank was accused of substantially assisting the primary violation of others by agreeing to delay a new appraisal until after bonds were issued, thereby allowing the fraud to occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.672" offset="402256">Central Bank was not involved in selling the bonds or marketing the bonds, but instead acted as indenture trustee, who had specific duties under a contractual document known as an indenture setting out the duties and setting out the bounds of its discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.083" offset="467875">This case was decided originally by the district court on a motion for summary judgment after full discovery, and at that time it was undisputed that the alleged substantial assistance by Central Bank involved no misrepresentation, involved no violation of duty of action or duty to disclose under the indenture, and in fact was a discretionary act under the indenture.</text>

            <text syncTime="984.014" offset="4083640">--Well, Your Honor, I think there maybe three levels to go with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.426" offset="4097224">I said there were two.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.377" offset="4101090">The first level is to find that there is a separate cause of action, and at that point in time, you can then very quickly conclude that Congress intended no such cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.034" offset="4139647">The second level is to say that it is rounding out, but the first thing we're going to do is to look at whether there is a private cause of action, using section 9 and 18 as models, and if you do that, you can come to the conclusion that there's no private right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.112" offset="4195967">You don't have to get into the broader issue even in that second realm of looking at whether or not it exceeds, if you will... whether the conduct exceeds what is permitted by section 10(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.642" offset="4242151">The third is the broader one, and that would be to say that we look at the language, we knew what we said in Ernst and Ernst, and that is manipulation and deception means manipulation and deception, it doesn't mean something else such as substantial assistance of manipulation and deception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.290" offset="4304741">That is the broader ruling, Your Honor, and I think that one would take care of the SEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.895" offset="4327101">However, let me just mention, there is some implication here that the SEC is going to be left powerless if in fact you take that broad ruling, and I think that that is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.371" offset="4365031">Yes, Congress after all has given the SEC aiding and abetting authority in section 15 with regard to these disciplinary proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.366" offset="4397005">And also in 1990, in a recent amendment, they... they held that the SEC... this is the Congress again, Mr. Chief Justice... held that the SEC had cease and desist authority against any person who is violating, has violated, or is about to violate any provision of the statute, or any other person that is, was, or would be a cause of the violation due to an act or omission such other person knew or should have known would contribute to such violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.655" offset="4510167">The point being, it seems to me, that the SEC still does have enforcement authority both in section 15 as well as this section, which is 21(c), added in 1990.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.964" offset="4559382">The second point that I think that this brings out is that Congress knew again how to create liability beyond just the direct liability that is set forth in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.989" offset="4599506">They used aiding and abetting language in the SEC disciplinary proceedings, and they used contribution language in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.254" offset="4632630">Let me just spend a moment, if I may, on the second issue which hopefully you will not have to reach, and that is the issue of what is the proper scienter standard if, in fact, there is such an aiding and abetting right.</text>

            <text syncTime="1215.207" offset="5008375">Okay, and the reason why there shouldn't be enough if it's aiding and abetting would be to recognize that... if you find that there is a separate cause of action for aiding and abetting, or that there is an additional cause of action implied by Congress for aiding and abetting, the principal difference being that that is one step removed from a primary violation and yet carries with it joint and several liability, and so there is a logical basis for saying that in that circumstance we're going to require a higher degree of knowledge or scienter than we are in the primary violation.</text>

Hydrolevel, there you had an express private action under the Sherman Act, and the question there was whether there should be a right against an employer on an agency theory, and similarly there, the courts said, looking at the common law and saying that the agency theory was well-established in the common law, that to be faithful to the purpose of the Congress in the express private action, that the case should reach beyond primary violators to an agency theory.</text>

            <text syncTime="2645.054" offset="10727728">The aider and abettor may not have to make an agreement with this primary defendant, and perhaps the aider and abettor wouldn't have to know that this primary defendant was about to manipulate or deceive, but the aider and abettor would have to know that someone was in a position to do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2728.670" offset="11062200">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.497" offset="11109534">This Court recently reaffirmed in Musick, Peeler that it's the responsibility of the Federal courts to give content to and round out the private right of action that has been recognized under section 10(b) of the '34 act and the Commission's implementing rule, 10b-5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.987" offset="11167526">For the past 30 years, the lower Federal courts have uniformly held that aiders and abettors are properly named as defendants in suits under 10(b) and 10b-5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.415" offset="11209217">There are hundreds of such reported decisions in the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.185" offset="11224264">In our view, a practice that is so embedded in the enforcement of the Federal securities laws should not lightly be overturned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.420" offset="11249237">In our view there... not only are there no compelling reasons for doing so, but the relevant indicia that this Court has looked to in giving content to the 10b-5 cause of action all strongly reinforce the existence of aider and abettor liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.663" offset="11314230">First of all is the very practice that has gone on for 30 years, a point the Court noted in Musick, Peeler, that the experience of the lower Federal courts is itself a factor to be taken into account, but turning to the text of the securities laws themselves, section 10(b), in statutory terms, is written very expansively, referring to any person who directly or indirectly engages in the conduct to which the section speaks, language that is broad enough in itself to include aiders and abettors, especially given the common law background, and we cite a case of this Court going back to 1869 holding aiders and abettors liable in common law fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.119" offset="11480055">Read against that background, and the background of protecting investors, the language of section 10(b) itself is a basis for finding aider and abettor liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="2851.719" offset="11554452">But beyond that, there are a number of other important indicia in the securities laws themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.985" offset="11583500">For example... well, not in the securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.558" offset="11597815">I think I would start with 18 U.S. C section 2, which is significant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.710" offset="11614429">It provides that an aider and abettor is liable as a principal, and we think that is significant, that in terms of giving content to the private right of action under section 10(b), it is important to look to the persons whom Congress has deemed to be responsible when a violation of 10(b) occurs and section 2 of title 18 makes absolutely clear that Congress deemed a person who aids and abets a violation of section 10(b) to be responsible.</text>

            <text syncTime="2904.186" offset="11764267">No, my point is that as applied to section 10(b), Congress has deemed and in fact held criminally responsible persons who substantially participate in a violation of section 10(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.745" offset="11818497">In other words, in terms of rounding out the cause of action, it's not necessary to find that Congress had a specific intent under... in enacting title 18 with respect to section 10(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.490" offset="11857472">My point is simply that Congress has deemed that a person who aids and assists any violation of a law to be liable, and not only liable, liable as a principal, who has substantially participated and therefore is equally culpable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2957.021" offset="11975650">--Well, in the criminal law context, you would of course need a statute to say who is responsible, and the reason the Congress had adopted... enacted section 2, as this Court said in Standefer, was to, for example, overcome the common law rule that if the principal is acquitted the aider and abettor could not be found liable, and Congress wanted to eliminate that artificial distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.115" offset="12068019">After all, someone who substantially participates in a violation of the law is quite culpable in bringing about the injury in this case to the plaintiff, so we think that section 2 is very important, because it not only identifies whom Congress thought was responsible, but also puts the person on notice that his substantial participation in the fraud will give rise to liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="3040.994" offset="12311585">--Right, there was a letter dated May 13th, I think, of 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.085" offset="12323914">The other... the other places in the act where Congress has identified that aiders and abettors should be responsible and the Commission's longstanding ability to get injunctions against aiders and abettors under section 21 also reinforce the idea that aiders and abettors are responsible and therefore set the... an appropriate parameter for the private right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.682" offset="12418269">Also, the statutory analogues that this Court has looked to, particularly sections 9 and section 18 of the act, far from supporting petitioner's position support respondent's position in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.939" offset="12463304">Section 9 imposes liability on anyone who wilfully participates, and participates is an expansive term, in fact the term that respondent elsewhere identifies with aiding and abetting based on this Court's decision in Nye and Nissen, someone who participates in the transaction, so section 9 we think is clearly broad enough to include aiding and abetting liability, and the same with section 18, which refers to any person who makes or causes to be made any misleading statement in a registration statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.868" offset="12575003">And finally, the private right of action for aiding and abetting is a very important supplement to the SEC's own enforcement authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.512" offset="12605619">The SEC can go after aiders and abettors just as it can go after primary violators, but just as in the case of primary violators, the SEC is not in a position to uncover every bit of wrongdoing and also is not in a position to compensate victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.762" offset="12662566">Its role is the different one of deterring violations by disgorging profits or enjoining future violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.886" offset="12691092">That's why, just as in the case of primary violators, the private right of action is important in the case of aiders and abettors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.572" offset="12721812">If I could move on to the recklessness standard, in terms of primary... primary violators, it's settled in all the courts that recklessness is an adequate showing in order to establish liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.752" offset="12786595">That was also true at common law fraud, against which section 10(b) should be read.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.924" offset="12807284">Indeed, in this Court's decision in Cooper v. Schlesinger, the Court said a statement recklessly made without knowledge of its truth is a false statement knowingly made, and when an aider and abettor substantially participates in the making of a false statement, then we believe that the same standard of recklessness that applies to the primary violator should apply to the aider and abettor, because after all, again, the aider and abettor is liable in the criminal law as a principal.</text>

            <label>Mr. Tucker Karl Trautman</label>
            <text syncTime="3278.330" offset="13260874">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.210" offset="13268398">Mr. Gersh's concession that he could not have brought an action against my client for a primary violation speaks volumes as to whether or not my client engaged in manipulative or deceptive conduct which is the keystone of section 10(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.819" offset="13326807">However, I don't want the Court to get the impression that professionals could never be sued under a primary violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.783" offset="13350736">I think clearly they could, but they would have to essentially have participated in and engaged in deceptive conduct, something that did not happen here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.083" offset="13395875">I think as Justice Scalia indicated, the allegation against our client is not that we participated in a misrepresentation, because we didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.836" offset="13430879">We had nothing to do with the selling process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.689" offset="13438298">What we are accused of doing is essentially by our conduct allowing the fraud to occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.901" offset="13459196">The Government argues that the common law was so well-established at the time the Congress passed 10(b) that it must have presumed to have incorporated it, and we think that this Court's decisions in Blue Chip, Ernst &amp; Ernst, and Santa Fe Minerals, essentially made clear that there is not an automatic implementation of those principles into the law, but instead, that there has to be some demonstrated showing that Congress intended to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.654" offset="13598167">The common law... or, strike that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.496" offset="13605586">The Securities Act was not intended to be a panacea for all evils under the securities laws, and I think those decisions indicate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.069" offset="13635888">Finally, let me just comment that, interestingly enough, the very source of the recklessness standard... that is, section 876 of the Restatement of Torts, which talks about substantially assisting, in that standard, recklessness is not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.952" offset="13707359">You have to have knowledge, under the tort law, for substantial assistance, whereas here, what our opponents are asking you to do is to graft on a principle in the deceit context onto substantial assistance, which even the tort law doesn't do.</text>
