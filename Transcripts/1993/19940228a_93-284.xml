            <text syncTime="62.634" offset="401425">This Court in Berwind, Berwind-White Coal Mining v. Chicago and Erie Railroad in 1914 said that a tariff, while arguably lacking some of the formalistic requirements that the act requires and that the Interstate Commerce Commission might require, is enforceable if it is received with no objection as to form and if it is adequate to give notice to the public of the rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.878" offset="486375">This tariff disclosed a rate, the rates were not stated in cents per mile, but they were determinative on getting the mileage.</text>

            <text syncTime="129.238" offset="667874">First of all, the ICC's claimed voiding power does not come from this failure to be listed in the participating carrier's tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.501" offset="692952">The ICC's claimed voiding power comes from the failure to give a power of attorney to the publisher of the guide.</text>

            <text syncTime="146.229" offset="735792">The public reading the regs and reading the guide itself, or the things attached to the guide, would believe that you were no longer using that mileage guide after a certain date.</text>

            <text syncTime="162.018" offset="799009">The statute does not require a mileage guide, the statute requires disclosure of rates, and this tariff, this 501-B tariff, very plainly disclosed what the rate would be for Riss.</text>

            <text syncTime="185.612" offset="893363">This Court acknowledged it in Davis v. Portland Seed, said its defects are inevitable, and if there's a certain defect, what do you look to if you have, perhaps, tariffs that conflict, or tariffs that might be partially incomplete.</text>

            <text syncTime="1023.462" offset="4244769">The statute requires us to file rates, it doesn't require us to file mileages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.673" offset="4261592">You can determine mileages without having a mileage guide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.236" offset="4275907">As a matter of fact, the Commission's own regulations at 49 C.F.R. part 1048, when referring to what are called commercial zones, refers to airline miles around a particular city, which would require some sort of external measurement, so the tariffs don't require precision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.038" offset="4343094">What it requires disclosure of rates in such a fashion that would enable somebody to challenge the rates as discriminatory or unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.754" offset="4377889">One thing this Court cited with approval in the Maislin case was the regular common carrier conference case by the D.C. circuit decided in 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.178" offset="4415610">In that case, the Commission had put forth a rule which basically said, you can put in your tariff, or actually a group of carriers had published a rule which says, you can negotiate whatever you want to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.116" offset="4455420">That was in the tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.057" offset="4459182">That is basically the sum and substance of what was said, and it was challenged by a group of carriers which said, that doesn't meet the requirement for a rate in the tariff, and the D.C. Circuit said, that requirement is utterly central to the act, and the Commission came back and said, well, we have all these other methods of determining tariff rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.379" offset="4532429">And what the D.C. Circuit said is that while those tariffs haven't been challenged yet, what they said... and this is from page 380, 793 Fed 2d 380... for example, under volume discount rules, competing carriers cannot determine the per unit rate, but the carrier is charged with knowing the volume tendered by the shipper, but they do at least know how the per unit rate is determined, enabling them to protest the application of a different formula to a particular shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.886" offset="4634411">So if for some reason some shipper took that extraordinary step and went two tariffs removed from Riss' tariff and was somehow confused about the mileages, at least we have a disclosed rate and a method of challenging that rate and perhaps challenging the application of that rate for a calculation of mileages in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.916" offset="4702539">And by the circuit court's opinion, by upholding the retroactive effect of 1312.4(d), they basically got the filed rate doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.572" offset="4745170">It makes the disclosed rate unreliable, and this Court has said in Berwind, said it in Davis v. Portland Seed, that that disclosed rate, that the carriers at a certain point have to be able to place repose in the tariffs that are on file.</text>

            <text syncTime="2322.136" offset="9439479">Under the Commission's longstanding and consistent interpretation of the Interstate Commerce Act, if a carrier wishes to meet its filed rate obligation by referring to someone else's tariff, he must participate in a continuing agency relationship with that other entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.249" offset="9511890">That interpretation, which goes back more than 50 years, is currently reflected in the Commission's void for nonparticipation rule, which provides that if a carrier allows its participation in an agency tariff to lapse, the tariff becomes void as a matter of law as to that carrier.</text>

            <text syncTime="2355.789" offset="9574062">What's the reason for that nonparticipation rule, Mr. Manning?</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.400" offset="9584511">Is it really just to enable the person who files the other tariff to be able to collect $83, or is there some other reason for it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_f_manning" startTime="2366.959" stopTime="2634.671">
            <label>Mr. John F. Manning</label>
            <text syncTime="2366.959" offset="9618783">Well, as the ICC indicated in its Wonderoast decision, which is cited in our brief and which appears in 8 I.C.C. 2nd, that doctrine is an interpretation of the statutory requirement that appears in two sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.695" offset="9665699">In section 10702 of title 49, it provides that the carrier shall establish the rates for its transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under the relevant subchapter, and section 10762 of title 49 provides that the carrier shall file a tariff containing those rates, and so in effect the ICC has interpreted the statute in a way that places the responsibility on the carrier to set its own rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.574" offset="9785236">Now, the practical reason, I think, for the policy is that these tariffs are very complicated and expensive to put together, and a lot of tariffs are put together by so-called rate bureaus which compile this information and set up the system of rules and practices and so forth that govern the transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the act, and if there were not a participation requirement in the ICC's rules, then everyone would literally free ride on these agency tariffs simply by filing a tariff that referred to the agency tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.074" offset="9915221">That's why the ICC's rules are quite explicit in saying that when a carrier who is a party to a tariff, and that includes its own tariff, refers to a separate tariff, and when its rates are governed by that separate tariff, it must be a participant in that separate tariff as well, and that requirement is contained in section 1312.27(e), and I just want to pause for a moment and address petitioner's claim that the decision in this case is actually inconsistent with the ICC's regulations, when in fact it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.847" offset="10058267">The HGB Mileage Guide, the tariff from which petitioners... I'm sorry, from which Riss' participation was cancelled, is governed by a provision contained in section 1312.30, which is in on pages 9a and 10a of the appendix to our brief, and on page 10a, subsection 4 provides that except as provided in the specified subsection, which refers to Government publications, only distance guides officially on file with the Commission may be referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.362" offset="10196403">Now, that's another way of saying, as the Commission explained in its Jasper Wyman decision, that a distance guide is in fact a tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.915" offset="10218555">Now, if you then turn to page 8a and look at section 1312.27(e), the provision I've just cited, it says that a carrier participating in a tariff which refers to... in tariffs which refer to and are governed by separate tariffs, they shall also participate in those governing separate tariffs, and that means that when a carrier refers to a mileage guide, and when its rates are governed by that mileage guide, it must also participate in that mileage guide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.185" offset="10343629">Now, there's one other provision I want to refer you to, and that's the heart of this case, and that's 1312.4(d), which is cited on page 3a of our appendix, and that provision says that a carrier... and this... I'm starting at the third line down, after the word "however", a carrier may not participate in a tariff issued in the name of another carrier or an agent unless a power of attorney or concurrence has been executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.131" offset="10447387">Absent effective concurrences, or powers of attorney, tariffs are void as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.895" offset="10470480">Now, we believe and the Commission has so held in the Jasper Wyman decision as well as other decisions, that if you read those three provisions together, they require the conclusion that a carrier must participate, must maintain an agency relationship with the publishers of a mileage guide in order to be able to refer to that mileage guide as part of its filed rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.769" offset="10553967">Now, Riss did not do that in this case, as petitioners concede, and for that reason, although Riss did have a filed tariff, its tariff number 501-B was on file, it did not have a filed rate, because a shipper who consulted Riss' tariff 501-B would be referred to the mileage guide to determine the critical quantity term in the tariff, and examining the mileage guide, the carrier would see that the mileage guide in a notice that's in bold letters on page 2 of that tariff--</text>

            <text syncTime="3356.989" offset="13578842">Well, the actual shipping transactions came up pre-Maislin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.741" offset="13597859">The question you deal with, now you have... assuming their argument is right, and you can't use the mileage guide, does that mean you have an incomplete tariff?</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.596" offset="13625340">There's nothing in the law that says you have to have miles, a booklet of miles in order to determine mileages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.161" offset="13647596">The same way Mr. Augello talked about being able to manipulate mileages, you can manipulate weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.083" offset="13667241">You have rates that are in cubic feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.524" offset="13676958">You can manipulate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.967" offset="13682810">There's all sorts of things that you can manipulate that would be illegal, but a mile is something that's finite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.090" offset="13703290">This Court said, in a case called Hewitt Robbins v. Eastern Freightways in 1962, that a shipper is entitled to receive the rate over the cheapest route available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.406" offset="13740488">There's nothing that says tariffs have to be perfect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.766" offset="13746026">If we can't use the mileage guide, if you determine somehow that this reference was illegal, you still have this tariff that continued to be on the shelf that people continued to rely on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.433" offset="13784687">By treating that tariff as void, by putting blinders on and saying, that tariff was there and accepted, nobody ever challenged is nonexistent, well then, of course, you're doing what Maislin says you shouldn't do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.090" offset="13823244">You're allowing a negotiated rate to supersede a tariff that may have some imperfections, but a tariff that disclosed a rate that the public relied on.</text>
