            <text syncTime="50.115" offset="354050">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="53.097" offset="365962">The Court has agreed in this case to decide whether the user fees that are imposed on the airlines and their passengers at the Kent County Airport are reasonable within the meaning of the Federal aviation laws and within the meaning of the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.235" offset="422491">All parties here appear to be agreed that the criteria by which the Court should decide this question are those set out by the Court in the Evansville decision, and we believe those are the minimum criteria that the Court ought to apply in this case, and when the Court applies those criteria, we believe the Court should find that the methodology used by Kent County in fact violates the criteria in at least three different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.433" offset="519353">First, the fee methodology is not based on a fair approximation of use by the various users at the airport... that is, that the costs are not fairly allocated among users... second, the revenues that are produced by the fee methodology are vastly in excess of the airport's own costs in delivering service to the users, and finally, the airport's fee methodology deliberately discriminates against the airlines in favor of local aviation.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.299" offset="630739">I would like to comment on each of these three requirements, and then, if time allows, I would also like to comment on an issue that we do not think is properly before the Court, but that the Solicitor General and the airport do... that is, whether or not, even if the fees are unreasonable, whether the airlines are permitted to bring a legal action to challenge them.</text>

            <label>Mr. Walter A. Smith, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="152.471" offset="763441">Nevertheless, we realize the Court may elect to reach it, so we have briefed the matter in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.864" offset="785071">I was going to start with the allocation issue first.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.615" offset="796042">Under this Court's Evansville decision, airport fees must, in the first instance, be based on what the Court called 7, this means that the fee should not be higher than the airline's properly allocated costs, but in our view, this airport has not even attempted to comply with this requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.091" offset="889979">As the Court knows, at this airport, as at most, there are two main groups of users.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.044" offset="909727">There are the airlines on the one hand, and the concessions on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.727" offset="924460">Both of these two groups of users benefit significantly from costs that the airport expends on what are called the air operations costs, and the reason for that is, without the airport spending money on taking and landing... takeoff and landing facilities, there would be no customers, either for the airlines or for the concessions, and for that reason, in our view, in order to fairly approximate the use, the airport was required to allocate at least some of the costs to the concessions, but they did not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.369" offset="1059043">They allocated none of the costs to the concessions, and the result necessarily was, and mathematically so, as Judge Flaum found in the Indianapolis decision, the fair share of the costs to the airlines was too high.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.068" offset="1109825">They were in fact paying more than their fair share of the cost.</text>

            <text syncTime="274.521" offset="1251722">After all, Evansville was a Commerce Clause decision, and we believe when Congress adopted the AHTA it essentially adopted in part the Evansville requirements, and the Court has often decided other cases where reasonableness in that context was required to be decided.</text>

            <text syncTime="2458.845" offset="9988950">I would like to address briefly the three bright line tests, as Mr. Smith has called them, of the Interstate Commerce Clause test in the Evansville case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.134" offset="10038165">This airport does not retreat from any kind of analysis of the merits of its methodology and the results of its methodology.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.458" offset="10063451">First, the charges must reflect a fair approximation of the use of the airport facilities from which the airlines do benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.586" offset="10103889">In very simple terms, it would appear that could mean one, two, or three things, either that the user charged must receive some benefit from the item for which the user is charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.832" offset="10152895">We certainly pass that test, and to the extent that is a subpart, we agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.095" offset="10169926">To the extent that the benefit may mean that an airport cannot goldplate its facilities... for instance, to have Vermont marble on the ticket countertops or oriental rugs on the floor, we agree that benefit can mean that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.005" offset="10221649">What we would suggest that is the critical issue in this case, whether it be viewed under the Evansville standard or any other standard, is a serious warping by the airlines of what benefit means when they suggest that somehow an airport in determining its charges to one tenant must look, either by cross-credit or by change in cost allocation to the varying benefit that yet a different category of tenant might receive from its business results.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.722" offset="10340454">We suggest that there is no precedent of this Court in any airport or other local governmental setting that would require that a local government as owner and landlord engage in such an evaluation of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.422" offset="10391236">With reference to benefits, I would point out very simply that the district court found in unchallenged fashion that the totality of all airport charges, including the reduced overnight aircraft parking fee and including 100 percent of CFR, constituted only 1-1/2 percent of the gross revenues received by the airlines at this particular airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.696" offset="10484336">The second, and I think the simplest of the so-called Evansville bright line tests, are that the airport charges may not be excessive in relation to incurred costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.783" offset="10528744">In that regard, I would point out that the district court found as a specific critical finding of fact that only break-even costs as defined under the methodology and as shown under the evidence were charged to the airlines and as such I think that automatically satisfies the second charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.818" offset="10608888">And certainly I would indicate further that the Solicitor General has indicated that there is a reasonable latitude even above the incurrence and the allocation of actual costs and clearly that has been satisfied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.634" offset="10660088">The third criteria of Evansville is that the charge does not discriminate against interstate travel, and I would point out first that general aviation and the airlines are not in the same category of tenant under the Airport and Airway Improvement Act or under any other analysis that might be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.068" offset="10729887">They do not, in fact, compete, and there is no evidence to show that they compete.</text>

            <text syncTime="2657.346" offset="10782968">The economy of collection, which is a quotation from a portion of the Airport and Airway Improvement Act, certainly indicates that as to general aviation flights that are unscheduled it is very difficult, when they land without prior notice at an airport such as ours, to be able to apply a standard landing fee, and then to have a separate billing and to know where that billing should be sent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.571" offset="10875859">And consequently this airport and, as the testimony indicates, other airports have gone to different means, which traditionally have included hangar fees, tie-down charges, and more often, also in accordance with the Airport and Airway Improvement Act, so-called fuel flowage charges on the gasoline sold by a local airport to those general aviation entities who may land there, or land there and stay there, and it is in that respect that the airport has chosen to approach the collection.</text>

            <text syncTime="2916.376" offset="11819089">I... there certainly could be a mandatory aspect of the question you ask, but I do not believe that the charge for that facility is covered by the Anti-Head-Tax Act, and I would suggest, Your Honor, that perhaps the simplest analysis of whether concessions are included in section 1513(a) of the Anti-Head-Tax Act is to analyze the argument of the airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.381" offset="11919086">They claim concessions are included in section (a), and they claim that section (b) is a so-called savings clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.155" offset="11946253">If both of those premises are true, it is clear that section 1513(b) did not save concession charges as being illegal under 1513(a), which would leave you with the absurd and I think illogical result that all concession charges at the airport would be illegal, and I suggest that that simple analysis is perhaps the easiest way to approach the very important issue here as to whether concession revenues are at all addressed by or regulated by the Anti-Head-Tax Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.773" offset="12060669">And we suggest that there is no such regulation, that Congress has simply chosen to regulate the mandatory side of airports through, initially, the Airport and Airway Improvement Act, and secondarily, the Anti-Head-Tax Act, certainly in indicating by clarifying language that these types of charges are to be permitted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3003.591" offset="12167980">I mean, you and the United States are proposing that we leave all this to the Secretary, but the strange phenomenon is that the Secretary's had only one case involving this legislation, and there are very major issues such as the one we're just talking about, about whether, you know, concession fees are included, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.613" offset="12232032">How can it be that it's really his bailiwick and yet he hasn't done anything?</text>

            <text syncTime="3023.005" offset="12245616">I would suggest something that I think is outside the record, but yet I think is certainly known, and that is that in many instances with other airports there have been leases that could be of duration, 10, 20, or 30 years, so that these charges have been established in one form or another by negotiated leases that cover long periods of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.801" offset="12340806">Consequently, much of the period of time that would have been taken care of in the seventies and eighties were, I think, at many airports covered by leases of very long duration, and I think that to that extent the issue is now percolating I think to a greater extent than it has before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.133" offset="12418129">But I would suggest to the Court that in the very complex situation of the Massport case that the agency in fact did choose to entertain a complaint by a general aviation entity, chose to intervene in the other proceedings, and continued with an active role throughout all of that, and it was in fact the Massport proceeding that caused this airport to raise the affirmative defenses when it did in late December of '89 and early January of 1990.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.491" offset="12535575">And if I could address I think several questions that came from the Court, the dismissal by district court Judge Bell of the interstate commerce case was not solely on issues of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.360" offset="12586984">I hesitate to be before this Court and talking about answers to interrogatories and discovery, but the airport filed a combined motion under Rule 56 for summary judgment and 12(b)(6), and for the combined reasons of no factual proofs either to support an interstate commerce claim or, perhaps more importantly, to distinguish that claim from an Airport and Airway Improvement Act claim, or an Anti-Head-Tax Act claim, relying on that absence of factual proof and the rationale of the Merrion case, the district court so ruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.589" offset="12707983">And I would point out to the Court that the Sixth Circuit observed the nature of that ruling on pages 30 and 31 of its opinion, commenting that there was a factual aspect and lack of proof as well as to legal, and we stand here today, even without the absence of proof that in my judgment would indicate any violation of the Interstate Commerce Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="3181.387" offset="12879138">That opinion was on the eve of trial, after considerable opportunity to adduce facts that would distinguish and/or support an Interstate Commerce Clause claim, so I'm suggesting that there were two prongs, or two aspects of the ruling of the district court as affirmed by the Sixth Circuit, and the Sixth Circuit noted the contentions of the airport on page 30 and 31 of its opinion in that regard.</text>

            <text syncTime="3327.124" offset="13462086">First of all, at page 46-A of the appendix to the cert petition is where the district court quite clearly dismissed our Commerce Clause claim solely on the ground that Congress had taken action in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.571" offset="13515899">Second, with regard to Justice Scalia's question about whether or not concessions are covered by the AHTA, we take the view that whether or not they are covered, whereas here the concession fees are being paid ultimately by the passengers, the right reasoning is the one that Judge Posner used in Indianapolis, and that is to say that whereas here the total fees being imposed on the airlines and their passengers through this fee methodology vastly exceed the airport's costs, that is precisely what Congress intended to prohibit in the AHTA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.152" offset="13642227">And finally, let me address Mr. DuMont's point that we are relying only on the word 1513 on the merits of the private right of action issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.137" offset="13670126">That is not true at all, as we explained in our brief, but most importantly, whereas here Congress was intending to strengthen the prohibitions of Evansville, a case in which a right of action by the airlines had been recognized, it would be perverse to suppose that Congress was there by sub silentio taking away the most effective way of carrying out the indications in the AHTA of what the Congress wanted to achieve, and that, to us, is grounds enough alone to find we ought to win the private right of action issue even if the Court reaches it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.207" offset="13790393">Finally, I would mention that even if Mr. Hunting is kind enough to give away the CFR issue, if this Court reaches the private right of action issue, it will have to modify the judgment below, and under this Court's precedents the Court is not permitted to do that, whereas here, Mr. Hunting elected not to file a cross-petition.</text>
