            <label>Mr. Robert M. Westberg</label>
            <text syncTime="59.383" offset="381731">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="63.506" offset="398241">The petitioner in this case was convicted of the rape and murder of a 10-year-old girl and has been sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.363" offset="421646">The question in this Court... the question in this Court is whether Miranda applies to statements that he made during questioning in jail, without Miranda warnings, and before he had been formally arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.858" offset="467622">The statements were not by any means a confession of guilt, but were incriminating.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.435" offset="485908">The single issue here is whether the petitioner was in custody at the time of the statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.417" offset="509836">There was an evidentiary hearing in the trial court and it has been reproduced in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.305" offset="529375">Petitioner did not testify at that evidentiary hearing, only the police did.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.694" offset="550900">The State at that time had the burden of proving at the hearing that the petitioner was not in custody in order to show the admissibility of the statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.564" offset="586427">The trial court excluded, under Miranda, part of the statements, but only the part that was said after suspicion had focused in the policeman's mind on the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.341" offset="633552">The trial court found that this happened at the time that the petitioner described an automobile he had borrowed on the night of the murder as a turquoise car.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.260" offset="669183">The trial court made no findings of fact in this case at all, other than as to the particular point in the questioning that the suspicion switched to the petitioner, and the California supreme court affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.863" offset="723622">That court said that the trial court's finding as to the point when suspicion focused on the petitioner was supported by the evidence, and the court pointed out testimony of the police officers that until that point they would have let the petitioner go, had he requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.592" offset="782554">I will try to cover three points this morning: first, very briefly, the facts that we think are material to the custody issue; second, to discuss this Court's decisions, especially the reasoning of the decisions, that show that the State courts used the wrong analysis of the issue and also the factual elements that we think support a conclusion that petitioner was in custody, and third to demonstrate that the respondent's approach is unworkable and has largely been rejected by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.317" offset="881402">The material facts are quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.688" offset="906897">The victim in the case, a Robyn Jackson, disappeared from a neighborhood playground.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.311" offset="929467">Her body was found a very few hours later.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.857" offset="939602">A witness saw a car from which the body was thrown.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.419" offset="953813">He described it as turquoise.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.808" offset="959455">The police were told that Robyn had planned to meet an ice-cream truck driver with whom she had been friendly.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.555" offset="986414">The police found two ice-cream drivers who had been in the neighborhood on the day of the murder... now, we're on the day after the murder... and they determined to interview or question these men.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.474" offset="1026120">The petitioner was one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.864" offset="1035628">Eight police officers, or sheriff's deputies, went to the home of the first driver, not petitioner, and they were told that he was not at home, but they went in anyway and searched from room to room and found him hiding under a bed.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="235.124" offset="1084634">Mr. Stansbury, the question on which we granted certiorari is whether a trial court can determine that a criminal defendant is not in custody for Miranda purposes on the basis of the police officer's subjective intent that they didn't consider the defendant a suspect.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_m_westberg" startTime="250.899" stopTime="251.429">
            <label>Mr. Robert M. Westberg</label>
            <text syncTime="250.899" offset="1147746">That is correct.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="251.429" stopTime="255.179">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="251.429" offset="1149940">We don't ordinarily go into extensive review of facts.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_m_westberg" startTime="255.179" stopTime="326.321">
            <label>Mr. Robert M. Westberg</label>
            <text syncTime="255.179" offset="1164882">The extensive... I'm not going into an extensive review of the facts, Mr. Chief Justice, but the issue as to what caused the suspicion to focus on the defendant was, of course, the principal issue in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.127" offset="1216709">The question for this Court is whether that is the correct standard on which to determine custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.999" offset="1236144">In the case of the petitioner, four police officers went to the petitioner's home.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.636" offset="1274701">They arrived about 11:00 at night.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.542" offset="1282329">They had guns drawn out of the holsters, in their hands, and they knocked at the petitioner's door.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.696" offset="1302913">They told him that they wanted him to come to the police station, and I can refer to the... in the appendix, there's a very brief description of what was said to the petitioner at that time, and the significance of this, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the test that this Court has applied for determining whether there's custody for the purpose of Miranda is whether a reasonable person, in the standpoint of the defendant, believes that he has a choice, and the facts that I am relating to you are the facts from which we would conclude that a reasonable person would not believe that he had a choice.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="326.321" stopTime="338.629">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="326.321" offset="1449408">Well, speaking for myself, I think you're probably right about the standard that we have enunciated, but again speaking for myself, I didn't think the supreme court of California had departed in any material way from it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_m_westberg" startTime="338.629" stopTime="468.624">
            <label>Mr. Robert M. Westberg</label>
            <text syncTime="338.629" offset="1498727">I believe the supreme court of California stated the issue at the beginning as whether a reasonable person would believe himself in custody, but in fact, the analysis that that court made of the facts were focused almost entirely upon what was in the policeman's mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.809" offset="1571452">They talked in great deal about facts that a reasonable person, in the petitioner's mind... reasonable person in the petitioner's standpoint would know nothing about.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.353" offset="1605620">For example, why did they take him to the jail instead of to the police station?</text>
            <text syncTime="369.944" offset="1623906">They talked about difficulties getting into the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.506" offset="1638221">They talked about the nature of the information that was available to the police before they had gone to pick him up.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.630" offset="1662672">In other words, the California supreme court, although it mouthed the standard of a reasonable person, actually decided the case on the basis of the findings that had been made by the trial court, and they found only that the trial court's conclusion as to when suspicion shifted to the petitioner was supported by the evidence, and that until that point the police officers would have been willing to let him go.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.182" offset="1744905">At the trial, all of his statements came in through the point that he described the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.145" offset="1808748">These were used as substantive evidence of his guilt, and the jury was instructed that if they believed that he'd made false statements to the police, that could be considered as evidence of consciousness of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.813" offset="1859426">I don't think that there is any real dispute between the parties to the case that the lower courts applied the wrong standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.666" offset="1898819">The issue of the focus of the suspicion, the extent to which the police officers may have suspicion of guilt... it's a test which may have come from the Escobedo case... has been rejected by this Court all the way back as far as the Beckwith decision in 425 U.S., and it was made explicit in Berkemer.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.660" offset="1978858">Berkemer has said specifically that the strength or content of the Government's suspicion is not material to the issue of custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.485" offset="2014071">Now, it's very important--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="468.624" stopTime="474.888">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="468.624" offset="2018668">So you're acknowledging, then, that the answer to the question presented is no?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_m_westberg" startTime="474.888" stopTime="485.274">
            <label>Mr. Robert M. Westberg</label>
            <text syncTime="474.888" offset="2043746">--The question presented, may a trial court determine custody on the basis of the suspicion in the policeman's mind, the answer is no.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="485.274" stopTime="493.380">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="485.274" offset="2085228">So there is no dispute about the correct answer to the question presented, and the only question is what we do from there on?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_m_westberg" startTime="493.380" stopTime="597.228">
            <label>Mr. Robert M. Westberg</label>
            <text syncTime="493.380" offset="2117725">I think that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.707" offset="2123054">In choosing the correct standard, I think it's important that the Court be aware that we are not asking to expand Miranda in any way, or expand the rights of criminal defendants generally beyond what this Court has already laid out in cases such as Berkemer and Beheler and Miranda itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.744" offset="2211139">Berkemer and Beheler apply an objective standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.508" offset="2238202">The only relevant inquiry in deciding custody is whether a reasonable person in the position of the suspect would have understood his situation, not whether there's a formal arrest, and not whether the police think he's in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.908" offset="2299850">The court specifically rejected arguments that the undisclosed intentions of the police are relevant, because as a matter of logic, the police suspicions have nothing whatsoever to do with the concerns that moved the Court in Miranda, which were that the compulsive effect of in custody interrogation is inherently coercive, and as a matter of policy, the Court also in Berkemer thought it was not a good idea to have minitrials on the subject of what is in the police officer's mind, which would be decided primarily on self serving testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.879" offset="2435687">The principal difference between our position and the State's, given that the wrong standard was used, is that the State would look at each of the factors in this case on what I might call a divide and conquer approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.169" offset="2508830">That is, they pick up one fact, look at it, say this fact alone does not mean custody, put it aside, and never think about it again.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="597.228" offset="2533072">Well, why isn't the appropriate thing if the wrong standard was used, for us to say that's... the rest of it should be redone by the California court and not by us?</text>

            <text syncTime="648.583" offset="2738499">If the Court cannot say that, then the Court should either determine there was custody, or remand it back to the State courts to make that determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="797.149" offset="3332732">Our position that there was custody here is based upon the cumulative effect upon a reasonable person in the suspect's position of these factors: that he was questioned in an 8 x 10 foot room inside the jail at Pomona.</text>

            <text syncTime="994.772" offset="4123302">The petitioner did not testify, however, so there is no testimony that he actually saw the guns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.020" offset="4148275">The question, I think, for the Court, is whether he could have seen the guns, and if a reasonable person could have seen the guns, then whether Mr. Stansbury actually saw them or not is not the issue, because the question for the Court is to examine the police conduct and examine whether the police conduct was such that it would persuade a reasonable person in the defendant's position that he was not free to make a choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.213" offset="4249003">At the time of his interrogation, he was totally in the control of the police, whether or not they would have released him if he had asked to be let go.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.428" offset="4297904">The fact is, he didn't ask to be let go, and they didn't release him, and in fact after he described the car, he was given a Miranda warning, and when he said he thought he needed a lawyer, then he was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.734" offset="4351090">Looking at the situation from the standpoint of somebody in the suspect's position, this case... there's simply no comparison between this case and the facts in Mathiason or Beheler, on which the State principally relies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.664" offset="4418799">Both those cases involved questioning at a police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.069" offset="4436458">One was a State patrol office... Mathiason... one was a police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.488" offset="4454117">None of the cases involved questioning in the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.442" offset="4461953">In both the cases the individual had been told specifically that he was not under arrest and was not in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.142" offset="4492778">In the Mathiason case, in fact, the policeman had gone by his house, left his card, asked him to call him, the individual called, he came down voluntarily to the State patrol office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.200" offset="4533006">Our case is simply... there's simply no comparison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.525" offset="4554322">Now, I have to say that we don't have anything to offer to the Court by way of a bright line approach to custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.147" offset="4588804">If custody is going to depend upon the reasonable perception of somebody who was situated as was the individual in the case, there simply isn't any way to have a bright line test.</text>

            <text syncTime="2896.957" offset="11732040">Stansbury never hesitated in his responses, never asked to leave, never expressed any desire to stop the interview, even temporarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.688" offset="11766939">In Berkemer v. McCarty, this Court held that the defendant</text>

            <text syncTime="2949.232" offset="11941124">The questioning was neutral, nonaccusatory, the answers largely narrative.</text>

            <text syncTime="2973.349" offset="12037568">Mr. Chief Justice, Justice Stevens, the Supreme Court said at page 471 that focus was one of the most important factors, and they listed the focus of the degree of suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.718" offset="12091067">After it made the general statement about the reasonable person standard, it's obvious that they looked at focus as one of the most important, and it was in fact key to the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.245" offset="12129206">Your Honors, the argument that there was a disclosure to this petitioner that he was only a witness is not supported by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.991" offset="12168180">He was told that he was a witness, and at one time that he was possibly a witness, but he was never told that he was only a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.941" offset="12199945">In fact, the record doesn't even show what was actually said to him, and that may be the most important thing that would influence a reasonable person, but unfortunately this record simply has a description of the police officers, of what they said, and there are only four pages in the record that bear on this... pages 36 and 37--</text>

            <text syncTime="3036.588" offset="12290538">--Under People v. Sam, California has allocated that burden to the State to demonstrate the admissibility of the testimony, and in fact, in People v. Sam, California supreme court cited in the brief, the respondent does not disagree, Mr. Chief Justice, that the burden of proof was on the State in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.502" offset="12374234">We made that point in our opening brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="3083.850" offset="12479560">That it was required by this Court, or unless they did it in a way that this Court thought deprived constitutional rights, but in this case they've allocated it to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.598" offset="12510593">There was nothing said to him... there's nothing... no evidence of what was said to him in the interview room, as well as no evidence of what was said to him at the trailer, except for the four pages in the Joint Appendix, 36 and 37, and 56 and 57, that contains the description of the words that were expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.542" offset="12582378">We certainly don't argue that Mathiason or Beheler should be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.197" offset="12597006">It's not our view at all, and those cases are totally different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.337" offset="12609545">In both of those cases the police made clear what the status of the citizen was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.273" offset="12625219">One characterization of the State's argument is that it's up to the citizen to make clear what his status is, so when you come to the door and there are people with guns in their hands, you are supposed to say, am I under arrest, do I have a choice, and I think that's just a totally... it's a dangerous proposition as well as a totally unreasonable proposition, but in both Mathiason and Beheler the police said, you are not under arrest, and in fact in both cases they completely had the cnoice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.372" offset="12721663">The argument that there was nothing threatening here when he made his agreement to transportation to go to the police station, the answer to that is, there were four officers on his porch at 11:00 at night with guns, and what would a reasonable person do?</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.414" offset="12777878">The point as to the brevity of the questioning, it was... the record showed it was 20 to 30 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.646" offset="12802747">That might show lack of custody if they let him go at the end of 20 to 30 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.346" offset="12821555">In this case, they arrested him at the end of the 20 or 30 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.813" offset="12835452">We think that it cannot be said that he was not in custody, and that therefore this Court's choice under its own precedents would be either to find that he was in custody, which I think is indicated from Berkemer, because he was (a) in the jail and (b) he was in a situation where a reasonable person would think he couldn't leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.695" offset="12926985">Now, that's tantamount to a formal arrest, but--</text>
