            <text syncTime="11.039" offset="191476">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.121" offset="203805">The Government defends the must-carry law primarily by analogy to the antitrust laws, saying that it protects the broadcast system from anticompetitive actions by cable operators, but there is a critical flaw in this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.739" offset="266290">The law does not just prohibit anticompetitive activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.594" offset="285725">It prohibits all decisions not to carry broadcast stations for whatever reason the cable operator may choose.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.918" offset="314983">Thus, we submit, the Government must put forth an interest to justify what the law actually does, which is to override all editorial discretion with regard to carriage of broadcast stations, and we further submit that neither interest put forward by the Government can meet that burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.603" offset="393768">First, an interest in promoting particular programming does not meet the burden, because Government can't generally promote speech that it favors by the means of ordering others to carry it, or by discriminating against disfavored speech, and the interest in protecting the economic viability of the broadcast system as a whole does not support the law, because even without must-carry, cable systems carry the vast majority of broadcast stations, and the broadcast system is concededly thriving.</text>

            <text syncTime="164.489" offset="805249">The first is that even least access doesn't require any showing of anticompetitive behavior by the cable operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.885" offset="842865">It is again a law that is directed to all cable operators and simply removes discretion from those operators to program particular channels, whether they've ever engaged in any economic misconduct or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="275.821" offset="1250584">The cable operator has a choice of a number of different sources from which it can obtain programming, including, as you suggest, Justice Souter, creating its own programming, and what the must-carry law deliberately aims at doing is saying when you make that choice you must make it in a way that the Government directly controls, and not because the Government is saying you're engaging in some anticompetitive behavior, simply because the Government wants you to make a different choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="317.248" offset="1416305">I suppose the position that the carrier is in here, the operating company is in here, is somewhere in between that of the newspaper and the telephone company, and how should we decide whether the significance of a limitation on editorial discretion should be analyzed as if it were a newspaper, or on the other hand as if we were looking at it as an analogue to the phone company?</text>

            <text syncTime="421.617" offset="1833846">The question is, what, in fact, do the subscribers to a cable system, the readers to a newspaper, the patrons of a bookstore or a movie theater... what will interest them?</text>

            <text syncTime="440.127" offset="1907825">It seems to me that any member of the media can make decisions, and to say, for example, that we are simply going to say that you are making a decision for an economic reason, if a newspaper decides that it's going to carry a particular political cartoonist because that political cartoonist is popular and that will increase circulation, that may be entirely a business decision, but that's certainly something we don't think the Government can step in a preempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.455" offset="2009180">So the... indeed, this goes very much to the point that I'm trying to make, which is it seems to me that Government does have a legitimate interest in saying, when you are acting in a way that we typically prohibit under the antitrust laws, the laws that regulate competition, then when we tell you that you can't exercise your discretion for that reason in order to injure somebody anticompetitively, then we have the power to impose some regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.235" offset="2128299">But when Government goes further and says, we're going to control all of your decision-making with respect to a particular subject, whether you're acting anticompetitively or not, then it seems to me to have crossed a very important line.</text>

            <text syncTime="554.874" offset="2366849">The difficulty that I have with least access from the standpoint of cable systems is that, like the must-carry law, it does take away the discretion to program particular channels, and as I mentioned before, it doesn't do that based on any determination that there is anticompetitive activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.397" offset="2452948">It simply makes the decision that we are going to preempt the programming for those channels.</text>

            <label>Mr. Drew S. Days, III</label>
            <text syncTime="1509.759" offset="6186369">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.875" offset="6222836">What Mr. Farr wants the Court to do is basically ignore significant elements of the congressional decision to enact the 1992 law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.140" offset="6263900">At least two things can be said with conviction about the regulation of electronic media in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.114" offset="6287828">First, the Federal Government made a promise to the American public in 1934 that it would make available so far as possible to all the people of the United States a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide and worldwide wire and radio communications service, and it expected that the administrative agency charged with promoting that policy would do so consistent with public interest, convenience, or necessity, and do so in a way that was fair, efficient, and equitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.285" offset="6412485">Second, the electronic media field has been from its beginning, to quote Justice Frankfurter in the 1943 National Broadcasting Company case,</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.921" offset="6446966">"a field of enterprise the dominant characteristic of which was the rapid pace of its unfolding. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.106" offset="6471730">Over the intervening 50 years, Congress has striven to strike a balance in the best interests of the American people on the one hand by developing a regulatory framework that does not retard the growth of the electronic media and increased outlets for expression while on the other assuring the growth of the electronic media did not disserve the goals of diversity and broad, equitable, and free geographic distribution of access to electronic media.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.843" offset="6586669">It is a dynamic, not a static process that has required Congress to be alert to the existence and impact of new technologies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.818" offset="6618643">It is a process that goes on as I speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.880" offset="6630868">It is this morning's headline news.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.893" offset="6642885">We respectfully submit that the lower court correctly upheld the constitutionality of the must-carry provisions of the 1992 act, finding it essentially economic regulation designed to create competitive balance in the video industry as a whole.</text>

            <text syncTime="3037.629" offset="12297872">Secondly, the act in section 11, I believe, actually tries... 11 or 12... tries to get at the problem that independent programmers have been encountering, faced with competition by affiliated programmers, so that what Congress has done is try to give them a better position in the competition for access to these channels, but there are public educational and governmental channels that have been given over that can't be used by programmers, there's leased access that can't be used by programmers... this is an effort by Congress to deal with another problem in the same way that it dealt with the problems that PEG and the leased access arrangements did, so this is not in any sense an effort to get the programmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.331" offset="12500687">It's consistent with what Congress has tried to do over the years to create a marketplace in which people who have televisions without cable, and people who have cable availability, can get quality program stations both broadcast and cable and have the type of diversity of information and education that, as I indicated at the outset, Congress had in mind in 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.483" offset="12637255">Before I close, I'd like to just respond to some of the questions that were put to Mr. Farr.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.087" offset="12667662">He was asked about the capacity of stations, how many local stations would have to be carried, and he said 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.001" offset="12691381">I think that's very high.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.702" offset="12702143">For one thing, the act recognizes that there does not have to be duplication, so that in the case where there are 15 stations, there's bound to be some duplication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.480" offset="12741223">Congress also found that 9,000 of the 11,000 cable operators had unused capacity, and just to pick up in closing on the questions about a municipality and whether it could make decisions about which cable operator to carry, based in part on programming, Mr. Farr gave a very modest response by suggesting modest regulations, but I think the fact is that what this case presents, as do those hypotheticals, is a situation where economic regulation, where the need to ensure that the best service is provided to a community, comes into the decision-making process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.939" offset="12911123">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="3195.951" offset="12931185">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.701" offset="12938081">I would just like to briefly address, if I may, a few of the points of the economic theory on which the Government is relying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.439" offset="12973085">First of all, I could not emphasize more strongly that this is not a law that is tailored to the economic problem that the Government is talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.874" offset="13014777">It's the problem set out at findings 15 and 16 at 6 and 7 of the Joint Appendix, which is that cable operators will drop popular programming in order to divert advertising revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.284" offset="13064514">That's the theory on which it is based.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.875" offset="13074859">But the law does not prohibit cable operators from dropping broadcast stations for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.780" offset="13106414">It prohibits them from dropping them for any reason, however protected that might be in First Amendment Terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.792" offset="13130447">But second, if one looks at this practice which the Government has identified and the supposed threat to the local broadcast system, which is what is predicted in finding 16, there are two immediate problems with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.994" offset="13199306">First of all, as I have said, 7 years of experience without must carry show that in fact cable operators drop very few broadcast stations, and of course, even the numbers that are shown by the Government don't reflect the fact that cable operators also drop cable stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.824" offset="13258656">They're changing their programming as time goes on, so many cable programmers have been dropped during this period, too, from particular stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.769" offset="13282375">But in addition to that they carry virtually all stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.091" offset="13299721">They carry the most popular stations, which are their greatest competitors for advertising revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.084" offset="13319678">The FTC staff study that we lodged with the Court last week shows that, of the stations that are dropped, they either don't compete for advertising because they're public TV stations, or in fact they are very little watched, so they are very weak competitors for advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.163" offset="13375998">And overall the number of stations carried on broadcast systems has gone up, and Congress clearly expects this to continue, because in section 6, the retransmission consent provision, it gave broadcast stations the right to demand payment for carriage, so obviously the incentive to carry popular programming for subscribers, where most of the money comes from, is much greater than any incentive to drop stations in order to get advertising revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.791" offset="13478503">I'd like to make two other brief points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.831" offset="13486653">First of all, there has been discussion about the term, content-related, and I would simply like to say, I think it's important to recognize that this has two different meanings, both of which are implicated in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.229" offset="13532210">This law is content-related in one sense because it specifically dictates the kind of programming, or at least who provides the programming that is seen on somebody's television screen, so it is putting this programming on instead of this programming, the programmer who is knocked off.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.560" offset="13601592">Second, the reason it's doing that is also content-based, because Congress, as the findings suggest, has a preference for local programming, for the kind of programming seen on public TV stations specifically.</text>
