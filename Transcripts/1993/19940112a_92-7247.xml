            <text syncTime="1345.594" offset="5529552">The concerns respondents raise about the complexities of decisions of prison staff are not wrong, but they're not central to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.021" offset="5563198">The respondents' claim here is that they lacked actual knowledge of an unreasonable risk to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.146" offset="5587753">According to the transfer documents in the record, respondents didn't even consider petitioner's transsexuality when they placed her in general population in a penitentiary, even though the most distinctive fact about this petitioner is her transsexual status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.915" offset="5646789">You can't claim to have considered a risk you also say you didn't know about, thus respondents' denial of actual knowledge of the unreasonable risk logically precludes them from claiming that the placement was based on a reasoned judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1565.302" offset="6408311">Something that is possibly relevant to relief that I also need to clarify is something that I think reflects a misunderstanding on our part in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.380" offset="6448644">At the end of our brief in talking about the possibility of injunctive relief, we said that we thought that injunctive relief was no longer... would no longer be appropriate in this case because the petitioner was in administrative detention status because of his HIV-positive status and the fact that he had been involved in consensual sexual activity at Oxford.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.304" offset="6536311">Bureau of Prisons has a policy with regard to HIV-positive inmates that if they are either predators or if they are sexually promiscuous, it will very often put them in administrative detention status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.132" offset="6587616">And it was our understanding at the time we wrote the brief that the petitioner would remain in that kind of... either in that kind of segregated or status or at a place like Springfield, which is where he went after Terre Haute, which is a medical facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.160" offset="6635785">And although petitioner did remain in those two statuses for a long time... he was at Springfield for 2-1/2 years after Terre Haute, after he was put in administrative detention at Terre Haute... he was then put in general population at Florence, where he has existed for 5 months without any problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.013" offset="6707152">What's going on there is that putting HIV-positive people into a segregated status is something that the Bureau of Prisons does but they don't do that permanently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.391" offset="6748739">They continue to reevaluate whether that's the appropriate thing to do, because the general presumption is that they would like to put everybody in general population.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.507" offset="6781131">And therefore the time came... after he had been without serious problems for a long time, the time came when they thought that they should put him in a general population.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.014" offset="6815194">We still think that injunctive relief is not appropriate here because the injunction here that's requested has to do with placing him in a penitentiary status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.371" offset="6848631">Penitentiaries are those next-to-the-highest-level institutions, like Lewisburg, of which there are four or five, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.246" offset="6880082">Since there is no present threat of his being placed in a penitentiary status, injunctive relief we think is inappropriate in this case, because there isn't the kind of threat of that kind of action which would justify injunctive relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2766.148" offset="11211707">But there is nothing in the record in this case that indicates that either there was a great risk of that kind of assault at Terre Haute generally, in the general population, and there's certainly nothing that indicates there was any such risk in segregation at Terre Haute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.559" offset="11273356">And the position of the respondents here is that the four respondents who were responsible for sending the petitioner to Terre Haute only sent the petitioner to Terre Haute as a... as an institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.048" offset="11327273">They knew that when he got to Terre Haute he would be put in a segregated situation, administrative detention, for purposes of evaluation, and that the officials there would know what the situation was in Terre Haute at the time, and would know about his transsexualism and his history in prison previously, and that they would then make a decision, based on their... their based judgment, about whether it was safe to put him in the general population.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.667" offset="11429777">And it's not at all certain that they would make a judgment to put him in the general population.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.859" offset="11446600">When he was at Lewisburg, which was the first institution he landed at, he was never put in the general population.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.163" offset="11467811">And therefore you cannot say on this record that there could be enough evidence to survive a summary judgment motion that these... that these defendants had the knowledge of the risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.852" offset="11518489">Because even if you were to assume that there was a substantial risk in the general population at Terre Haute... and there's not any basis for that either given the statistics I've just mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.620" offset="11557568">Even if you were to assume that, there's no inevitability that the petitioner is going to go into the general population at Terre Haute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.845" offset="11582541">He could stay in segregation for a substantial time and then be moved to another institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.401" offset="11604693">Transfers from one institution to another are often does as a disciplinary matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.005" offset="11623188">If somebody, as this petitioner has, manipulates the institution, has access to telephones, commits credit-card fraud while in the institution, it's often thought that it's useful to move him to another institution where he won't have that... that same ability to manipulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.705" offset="11681911">That could involve moving him to another institution where he would stay in a segregation status for 6 months and then be moved to yet a different institution if the thought was he should then come out of administrative segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.223" offset="11724020">And so it's for those reasons that we take the position that there is no basis for... for remand on that issue, that the Court can affirm the summary judgment on that issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2913.126" offset="11799671">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.379" offset="11804687">When the Government refers to the record, of course they're referring to a record that we had no opportunity to develop with regard to the risk at Terre Haute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.116" offset="11843557">But I would submit, even bearing that in mind, that whatever the general risk, if it's 1 percent, of assault per year in Terre Haute, that wasn't this petitioner's risk of assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.883" offset="11890682">This petitioner was at a... at an extraordinarily high and unusual risk in comparison to the background risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.188" offset="11923909">And I'd like to... to then turn to Justice Stevens' comments about the... what was in the record, because what is in the record is about... what... where the record has some development is about what put this petitioner at risk, and that points out something that's important to bear in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.671" offset="11997784">Both sides here have a subjective standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.745" offset="12014084">It is... because to both sides actual knowledge of something is critical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.079" offset="12031429">To our case, actual knowledge is critical because in order for there to be a risk that is obvious, that... because it has to be obvious to the defendants, those defendants must know the facts, must have actual knowledge of the facts that make it an obvious risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.421" offset="12104781">So actual knowledge plays... is central to both cases' description of the subjective component.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.836" offset="12130486">And this also points out to something that is, I think, one of the real practical problems, and one of the things that's wrong with the Government's proposed standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.286" offset="12176252">In this case what is it that the... that the respondents didn't know about this petitioner?</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.888" offset="12202688">Presumably they would... they would... the record seems to indicate, and at least it is alleged that they knew she was a transsexual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.952" offset="12234976">The answer says... this answer admits this is a person who projects feminine characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.367" offset="12260576">They knew she was in general population at Terre Haute, a penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.910" offset="12274786">That they... according to the allegations of the complaint that she was not allowed to develop, they knew this was a violent place where a person with the characteristics of petitioner would be assaulted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.929" offset="12326822">They also, according to petitioner, knew transsexuals were at high risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.081" offset="12343436">But yet the problem with the Government's standard is even assuming that petitioner had all these allegations and therefore assuming that she would be able to establish them, they would still say I knew these facts but I didn't know that she was at high risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.252" offset="12408115">And that is... that is why it makes more sense when one looks at what is the actual knowledge that prison officials need to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.298" offset="12444269">It ought to be actual knowledge that makes the risk obvious, because otherwise it's always a retreating standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.013" offset="12471227">If there are no questions, I am concluded.</text>
