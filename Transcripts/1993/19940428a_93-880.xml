            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="155483">We'll hear argument now in Number 93-880, Judy Madsen v. Womens Health Care Center.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.873" offset="186934">Mr. Stavers.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mathew D. Staver</label>
            <text syncTime="9.871" offset="194876">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.918" offset="207101">Neither Judy Madsen, Ed Martin, nor Shirley Hobbs surrender their constitutional rights to free speech when they enter the speech free zone surrounding the Aware Clinic.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.804" offset="242627">This case is about the right to peacefully display a sign and distribute literature in a traditional public forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.364" offset="264884">Petitioners do not seek to trespass or blockade, nor are those portions of the injunction challenged here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.002" offset="291424">In a nonpublic forum, this Court noted that one need not ponder the contents of a pamphlet or leaflet in order to mechanically take it from someone's hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.187" offset="324130">Despite this Court's holding, the injunction totally bans literature distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.403" offset="345027">This Court recognized in Bray and in Casey that men and women of good conscience have common and respectable reasons for opposing abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.666" offset="374076">Indeed, abortion speech, or speech about abortion lies at the very core of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.383" offset="392988">If the First Amendment really means that speech must be uninhibited, robust, and wide open, the injunction must be dissolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.972" offset="427365">The injunction violates petitioner's right to free speech because it is both viewpoint-based and a prior restraint, and because it lacks precision.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.642" offset="457981">Viewpoint-based regulations like prior restraints come to this Court with a heavy presumption against their constitutional validity.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Mathew D. Staver</label>
            <text syncTime="84.623" offset="493925">Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, the reason why it's viewpoint-based is, Judy Madsen is restrained once she enters the 300-foot buffer zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.040" offset="523601">When she enters that zone, she can only speak if the listener favorably reacts to that speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.085" offset="547738">When she enters this zone, the injunction states that she can only speak if someone approaches her, extends a hand, or she can continue to speak only if they show a positive interest in what she has to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.862" offset="598833">Also, the injunction is specifically addressing Judy Madsen's speech, which in context is more than activities which it restrains, but goes to speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.342" offset="636763">Judy Madsen's speech at the abortion clinic is clearly on the issue of abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.059" offset="659646">Judy Madsen had not been to this clinic prior to the entry of the injunction.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="133.554" offset="689635">Well, what about the application of the 36-foot limit that just says you have to stay out of that?</text>
            <text syncTime="143.191" offset="728192">Do you take the position that's content-based, or viewpoint-based?</text>

            <label>Mr. Mathew D. Staver</label>
            <text syncTime="149.159" offset="752015">The reason is, is that Judy Madsen cannot ever enter that zone, whereas other individuals expressing a contrary view can.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="156.531" offset="781586">Well, but on your theory, every injunction, whether it's in the labor context or any other context, would be viewpoint-based, and I don't think we've ever thought that injunctions of that type became content-based just because they were focused on a named individual, or a group of individuals.</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="177.882" offset="866954">Justice O'Connor, it wouldn't be viewpoint-based on every injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.412" offset="877090">This injunction, for example, in sections (1) and (2) would clearly not be viewpoint-based.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.083" offset="895793">Those restrain activities which we don't challenge, but the injunction the way it was drafted and the way--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="190.424" offset="917109">No, but similarly, on the 36-foot zone, I don't see what makes that content-based, or a restriction that says you can't make noise within that zone, or something of that sort.</text>

            <text syncTime="212.103" offset="1003836">They state that the images that would be impermissible are those that tend to traumatize.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.476" offset="1021285">Who makes that determination but the listener's reaction to speech, and the listener's reaction to speech could never be a content-neutral basis for regulating an individual's--</text>

            <text syncTime="231.563" offset="1081681">I mean, it seems to me that answer is really a vagueness challenge, rather than a viewpoint-base challenge.</text>

            <text syncTime="268.766" offset="1230474">No, Mr. Chief Justice, that's not the basis of the challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.625" offset="1241968">The basis is that in the internal workings of the injunction itself, it says that when someone enters this zone... for example, Judy Madsen... she can only speak if that individual listener shows a positive interest in what she has to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.886" offset="1294944">That listener, therefore, is empowered with ex parte adjunctive authority to censor her speech.</text>

            <text syncTime="2671.938" offset="10843222">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.855" offset="10882823">In contrast to a statute or ordinance, a court order properly addresses the particular conduct that is before the Court and is properly confined to addressing that conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.834" offset="10930784">Consequently, we think the question before the Court presented here is whether the 1993 amended permanent injunction properly addressed the particular conduct before that court, and properly confined itself to addressing that conduct within constitutional limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.422" offset="10993165">This is a situation where Judge McGregor found that the 1992 injunction was inadequate to protect the interests of persons associated with the clinic, and that was not... that was an injunction that was not challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.791" offset="11054605">I think the record also shows some reluctance on the part of the judge to modify that injunction, but once he did, it was because he had heard 3 days of evidence in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.662" offset="11098072">The constitutional limits with respect to injunctions, we would submit, are those imposed by this Court with respect to reasonable time, place, and manner.</text>

            <text syncTime="2774.412" offset="11253031">Because I think that first of all it depends on what part of the 1993 injunction you're addressing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2785.891" offset="11299006">But I think to pick up on something that my colleague said, we're talking about not just a medical facility, we're talking about conditions where interference with the ability of women to get to the clinic and get the services that the clinic provides would cause them irreparable harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.165" offset="11376120">This is not a provision that would apply across the board to medical facilities, although I think it is true that medical facilities are not factories, mines, or assembly plants, as one of the members of the court said, but no, I think a court looking at the situation has the power to enjoin certain behavior that poses a threat to people in violation of rights that are protected under State or Federal law, and that's what the judge did in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2851.600" offset="11561798">I think that it's simply that the mode of analysis, the evidence that the court would look at with respect to the constitutionality of a statute that imposed time, place, or manner restrictions would be different from the type of evidence that the court would look at in dealing with an injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2963.319" offset="12008701">That would be the analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.460" offset="12013299">But it seems to me that applying the Fair Education Association time, place, or manner approach is perfectly suitable and sufficient for situations of this kind.</text>

            <text syncTime="3256.671" offset="13182121">To apply the time, place, and manner standard would result in the overruling of more than 60 years of this Court's precedent, beginning in 1931 with Near.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.183" offset="13216185">The standard applicable to this case is that an injunction touching on free speech is a prior restraint which carries a heavy presumption against constitutional validity and which must be precisely tailored to the exact needs of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.223" offset="13268325">That standard is totally inapposite to a time, place, and manner standard precisely because it focuses on someone's speech, in this case petitioner's prior to her or them being able to speak their speech.</text>
