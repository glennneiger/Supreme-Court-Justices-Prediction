            <text syncTime="687.563" offset="2902507">I was only suggesting that if the town wished to take on the function of collecting trash itself, then under the market participant doctrine it could take the trash that it collected wherever it wants to take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.936" offset="2948065">It can deal with whoever it wants to deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.871" offset="2955797">We believe that this case is essentially governed by the prior decisions of this Court in City of Philadelphia v. New Jersey and in Fort Gratiot Landfill v. Michigan.</text>

            <text syncTime="1412.528" offset="5802413">The amicus brief of the State of New Jersey, for example, reveals that the tipping fees in New Jersey are substantially higher than the 81 charged by the designated facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.300" offset="5845463">The reason that they are not permit... able to compete for those now is that under New Jersey law, which also has a flow control law, trash is permitted to leave New Jersey for purposes of recycling, of separating into recyclable and nonrecyclable components, but only on condition that the nonrecyclables are brought back to New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.548" offset="5926442">Now, petitioners, of course, are placed in the position, by this statute, of being literally unable to comply with the flow control laws of both New Jersey and Clarkstown, because Clarkstown directs that this identical trash must go to the designated transfer facility.</text>

            <text syncTime="1642.643" offset="6722863">What I am saying is that it is almost impossible, unthinkable to find a State or local law which allocates or regulates, on the basis of geography, those who are within the political process being treated one way and those outside another way, without there being some element of protectionism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.502" offset="6790259">I would grant that there could be cases where discrimination did not have those benefits, but I think... or allocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.037" offset="6812411">But I think here, if I can get to this case, first of all, we do not have a law which has a discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1678.928" offset="6868000">The law here, which counsel has referred to as an export ban... well, I suppose every law which regulates locally and has the effect of preventing a product from going out of the jurisdiction, in the same sense is an export ban.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.319" offset="6925574">And in that same sense, export bans have never been held, as such, to be unconstitutional, and that's why this case is not the flip side, as counsel has put it, of the New Jersey case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1709.780" offset="6991402">Is it kept in because it's from inside, and is it kept in, in the case of the processing and hoarding and other cases, for the benefit of local interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.886" offset="7023794">And I'd like to turn to the question... if I can answer the question that Justice O'Connor asked the counsel, about is this city, is this town essentially capturing... that word has been used in the papers of the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.111" offset="7072695">Is this town attempting to capture waste that is moving in interstate commerce?</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.246" offset="7089309">Well, to suggest that there is a capturing conveys the idea that there is truck moving through town and the town is reaching out for its greedy purposes, capturing the truck and making them pay a fee to pass through.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.620" offset="7142808">That is not at all what's going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.036" offset="7148450">I need to remind... I need to state that the petitioners in this case have a permit to operate under New York law as a recycling center.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.058" offset="7184499">They have a permit which states that 90 percent of the material they bring to their facility will be recyclable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.879" offset="7211771">In fact, in their permit application they say they are going to recycle cardboard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.181" offset="7225041">That means there would be 10 percent of that total material which would be discarded, worthless garbage, as we put it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.769" offset="7255343">Now, they bring that material into their facility in Clarkstown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.721" offset="7271121">As the... Mr. Carbone specifically testified, they put it on their floor, they separate it out into the recyclables which, as we know, they are permitted to sell and to ship in interstate commerce, and into the residue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.147" offset="7332875">And the issue in this case is that residue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.647" offset="7342906">Mr. Carbone also acknowledged, in an affidavit in lower court, that that material and the local material is all fungible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.384" offset="7373835">And he said, in fact... when he was concerned that the local town might have been mixing the out-of-town waste with the local waste, he said once it's commingled you can't tell which is which.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.292" offset="7417407">Now, what the town is saying to Mr. Carbone... and to everyone else in the town, no matter what kind of business they operate, the town is saying if you have garbage that is generated, meaning discarded, in our town, this is the way it needs to be handled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.734" offset="7483236">We believe it's in the interests of this community... we've made the legislative judgment that this is the way it should be handled, just as the City of San Francisco and the City of Detroit did in 1905.</text>

            <text syncTime="2635.073" offset="10692535">But I do think that those points need to be considered, about whether it is an article of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.811" offset="10715523">What I have suggested in the brief is that there are three doctrines which converge on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.929" offset="10736003">The doctrine of basically is it in commerce when the local jurisdiction essentially has a separate transaction between the place where it's discarded and the place where it is... comes to the transfer station.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.403" offset="10781874">The second, I think the quarantine cases have application here, because the idea of the quarantine cases... and it's a nondiscriminatory quarantine... is basically to say this is something we consider dangerous to the local community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.163" offset="10840911">Certainly, garbage is dangerous if it's not properly attended to, and therefore we are going to take it out of the process of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.817" offset="10867556">And the third is from the Sporhase case, the argument that the Court has recognized, as it did in that case, that you will take into consideration what private rights the State has given to engage in a particular business such as the removal of groundwater.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.826" offset="10927637">For those reasons, I do urge the Court to consider whether one approach to this case is to consider that the effect of the city's monopolizing this business, taking over in effect, requiring the waste to be treated in this way is, in effect, removing it or withholding it, if you would, from commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="2778.406" offset="11265871">And this is mandated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.691" offset="11275066">The city operates composting facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.560" offset="11286560">This is all part of the overall environmental plan that's involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.476" offset="11298158">It's not just a matter of a transfer station.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.226" offset="11305159">The city picks up white goods, discarded refrigerators and so forth and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.028" offset="11320414">And the point is that each business... if you imagine an alley with three entrances and three cans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.932" offset="11344029">You know, one's a supermarket, one's a clothing store, and another is Carbone's recycling center, and each one of them is required to recycle and each one of them is required to put out the residues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.757" offset="11395334">And the city law says that when that happens, those residues will be handled in a particular way that we had determined to be environmentally appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.177" offset="11428979">And that way is that it will be brought to a designated transfer station and that it will then be disposed of as we have arranged it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.497" offset="11458236">It is no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.997" offset="11468267">In fact, if the Court were to say that the town needs to differentiate this waste based upon the fact that it originated out of the town of Clarkstown, the Court would, in effect, be doing... requiring the city to do what it has struck down time and time again, as in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.773" offset="11535350">The Court would be requiring the town to impose a geographic classification.</text>
