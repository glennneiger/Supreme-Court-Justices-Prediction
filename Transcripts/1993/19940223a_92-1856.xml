            <text syncTime="13.391" offset="208302">This case presents the question of whether the City of Ladue, a small, 8-1/2 square mile residential community, has the right to protect its residents from the proliferation of signs that causes visual blight, harm to the landscape, safety problems, and a deterioration of real estate values.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.237" offset="287714">We submit that the sign ordinance at issue here today is constitutional under this Court's time, place, or manner jurisprudence, and we start the analysis with the governmental interests, because under the Court's opinion in Frisby, the Court noted that the governmental interest, the strength of those interests, informs the application of the test and, indeed, those interests are very strong in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.603" offset="385203">The City of Ladue has, since its very inception in 1936, made a comprehensive and longstanding commitment to the preservation of its beautiful, aesthetic community.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.894" offset="426372">It retained a renowned urban planner, one of the fathers of urban planning in this country, Harland Bartholomew, to devise the city plan which it has consistently followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.683" offset="465451">The sign ordinance is an essential part of the zoning plan and the comprehensive plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.737" offset="485722">It is designed to maintain this unique aesthetic ambience of this community, and it has done so on a consistent basis not only with respect to sign regulation but with respect to beautification projects and other issues as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="102.449" offset="564507">Not all signs are banned.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.483" offset="572658">There's a list of exemptions, and those exemptions would appear to be content-based as we have used that term in prior cases and, under our existing doctrine, how can you defend those content-based exceptions or exemptions?</text>

            <text syncTime="126.933" offset="662519">Justice O'Connor, we think that the exemptions are neutral in the sense that under Ward the controlling test for content neutrality was, what is the Government's controlling purpose, and here, the narrow exceptions that we required are safety-related and those that, in fact, are required by this Court's jurisprudence in the sense that there are no ample alternative modes of expression, such as an onsite sign.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="153.583" offset="769099">Well, but you have exemptions for sale or for lease signs, which certainly aren't safety-related, and for church signs and so forth, so surely some of those are content-based?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jordan B. Cherrick</label>
            <text syncTime="168.426" offset="828449">We think that under this Court's jurisprudence... for example in the Linmark case the Court held that real estate signs must be allowed because there are no ample alternative modes of expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.866" offset="874215">So what Ladue is doing in this context is not targeting the message, it's targeting the medium of signs, and it is also attempting to allow those signs where there is no alternative onsite--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="192.208" offset="923534">Well, do you think we have to apply our usual strict scrutiny test here, and under that test, do you think that the exemptions survive strict scrutiny, that there is a compelling State interest, that there's no other alternative that would be less burdensome, and so forth?</text>

            <text syncTime="215.491" offset="1016739">--Justice O'Connor, we think the ordinance does survive the strict scrutiny test, but we do not think the Court needs to reach that test, because what is at issue here today is, in the lower courts what actually happened is that the courts held that if Ladue allows any exceptions whatsoever, the ordinance is content-based, subject to strict scrutiny, and therefore unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.837" offset="1110049">We think that that places cities in a classic catch-22 position, because on the one hand, under the Court's jurisprudence, for example, in Linmark, certain signs must be allowed when there are no ample alternatives.</text>

            <text syncTime="274.695" offset="1253513">Mr. Cherrick, tell me if I'm wrong, but I thought the Ward case was about the decibel level.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.949" offset="1278591">It was turning down the volume, not excluding the expression, and here, it seems if you're going to use the Ward case the natural application would be to say you can regulate the size of the sign, you could regulate the number of signs, but how can you use Ward, which is turning down the volume but not excluding expression, as a justification for saying you cannot have any sign of this variety?</text>

            <text syncTime="310.802" offset="1397918">--Justice Ginsburg, proliferation is to signs what volume is to loud music, and what Ladue is doing here is focusing and targeting the medium of expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.176" offset="1447446">The Court pointed out in the Vincent case that signs have a unique problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.247" offset="1467717">It is the medium that creates the problem, and therefore the only way to eliminate this problem of visual blight is to eliminate the medium.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.668" offset="1497392">We think the logic of Vincent is compelling here today.</text>

            <text syncTime="338.603" offset="1509200">Is there anything in this record that shows there's a greater danger of proliferation for "Peace in the Gulf" than "House for Sale"?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jordan B. Cherrick</label>
            <text syncTime="348.125" offset="1547234">The record is undisputed that signs proliferate in neighboring communities, and Ladue does not target any particular message, it is focused on the medium, so that this ordinance applies and prohibits in a particular place signs on the landscape, controversial signs, noncontroversial, political, commercial, noncommercial... it is focused on this medium.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.174" offset="1639499">But I would like to address the question that you asked about the alternatives, and we... even though the least restrictive alternative test has been rejected, we cannot achieve the Government's interest here, Ladue's unique interest, with the alternatives, and let me explain if we look at some of these alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.468" offset="1712641">If we limit the size, for example, we still have the proliferation problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.522" offset="1728837">There is still the multiplicity of these signs under this uncontested record that are displayed and clutter up the windows and the yards and the trees throughout the neighborhood.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.128" offset="1771260">Now, it has been suggested that we could limit the number of signs.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.032" offset="1786829">Well, if we did that, we would come right up against this Court's content-based doctrine which prohibits that, because if we limited the signs to a minimum of one per household, we'd still have over 3,000 potential signs.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.626" offset="1849210">But in addition to that, we would have the problem of Government selecting the speaker and the message, because there could be multiple political races, multiple people living in a home, yet the Government would say that a particular house, there could only be one sign, and in another house a single person would be allowed to speak, and that would offend this Court's jurisprudence, and what we have tried to do is to comply with this Court's First Amendment--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="449.526" offset="1952863">So nothing is better than something.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.559" offset="1956939">That's essentially your argument, that it's more compatible with the First Amendment to allow nothing than to have a regulation that specifies a uniform size.</text>

            <text syncTime="463.869" offset="2010228">--No, Justice Ginsburg, because under this ordinance numerous modes of expression, ample modes of expression are left open for Respondent to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.308" offset="2043979">For example, a bumper sticker, a button... those are inexpensive personal expressions which would have achieved a much larger audience than these signs placed on the landscape that could be seen from the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.699" offset="2093507">In fact, the respondent did not even contest the issue in this case in the summary judgment proceedings that there were, in fact, ample alternative methods, which... we have affidavits that listed over 20.</text>

            <text syncTime="550.975" offset="2358702">But I think this goes back to the rationale of the content-based doctrine that Government should not force people to pick and choose the topics for public debate, and in fact there would be an advantage given to certain households over the others where this is--</text>
