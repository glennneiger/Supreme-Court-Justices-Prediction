            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="91049">The second case, Department of Taxation and Finance of New York against Milhelm Attea &amp; Brothers Et. Al. comes to us form the Court of Appeals of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.079" offset="139323">It involves the validity of a regulatory scheme adapted by New York for the purpose of preventing the evasion of taxes imposed on the sale of cigarets.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.563" offset="181224">Members of Indian tribes who purchase cigarets on Indian reservations are exempt from the tax but non-Indians making purchases on the reservations are required to pay it.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.437" offset="228767">The New York scheme imposes recordkeeping requirements and quotas on the wholesalers who sell untaxed cigarets to reservation Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.615" offset="265442">The legal question is whether that program is in conflict with federal statutes that govern trade with the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.422" offset="292714">The Court of Appeals held the program invalid but for reasons there stated in the opinion filed with the Clerk, we come to a contrary conclusion and therefore, reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
