            <text syncTime="15.303" offset="211060">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.784" offset="220986">The issue upon which this Court granted certiorari in this case is a very narrow one, and I submit it becomes even narrower in light of the questions that are not contested by respondent or any party in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.314" offset="275112">And I'd like to begin, if I may, by emphasizing what is not an issue, as we understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.657" offset="300503">First, no one before the Court, as I understand it, is asking this Court to reconsider Griffith v. Kentucky, and therefore I would submit that it is conceded before this Court that any Federal constitutional decision which is currently in effect must be applied to any decision on the merits of Mr. Powell's case, since his case is not yet final on direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.663" offset="388483">I submit it is further not contested before this Court that there was a presumptive McLaughlin violation in this case, because the 48... the petitioner did not receive a judicial determination of probable cause within the 48-hour time limit in which that is presumptively reasonable under McLaughlin.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.206" offset="470717">And so third I would submit it is not contested that under McLaughlin if it is applied pursuant to Griffith v. Kentucky, the Nevada Supreme Court erred in failing to give Mr. Powell the benefit of that decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="103.982" offset="565802">You would have forfeited it because the only thing that was raised by Powell was arraignment and not probable cause?</text>

            <text syncTime="123.826" offset="645215">We acknowledge it was not raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.889" offset="653469">The Nevada Supreme Court, which does so periodically, reached out sua sponte and drew this issue out of the case, and it decided it correctly with respect to the substance but incorrectly with respect to its retroactive effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="140.270" offset="710939">Wouldn't it be possible for the Nevada Supreme Court to say on remand, sorry, we certainly made a mistake; had we realized that McLaughlin had to be retroactive, we never would have brought it up, and so now we're deleting it?</text>

            <text syncTime="156.231" offset="774782">That would be a terribly result-oriented result in the case, Your Honor, but I submit that until the Nevada Supreme Court decides to do that, that question is premature at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.310" offset="835073">We might conceivably raise a law of the case argument in the Nevada Supreme Court since there is a very strong law of the case doctrine in Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.076" offset="870181">If the Nevada Supreme Court found some way to wriggle off the McLaughlin hook, I think that's a situation we would... we should address if it, in fact, does so.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.414" offset="911559">But they certainly have the power, and that has not been contested by any party to this case, to reach out and decide this Federal constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.092" offset="946250">And having done so, under Cohen v. Cowles Media and all of this Court's precedents having reached the issue on the merits, the jurisdiction is properly in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.976" offset="985747">I submit it's for another day if the Nevada Supreme Court... as are many of these issues in this case, are for consideration another day if the Nevada Supreme Court acts on remand in a manner that denies petitioner relief.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael Pescetta</label>
            <text syncTime="233.263" offset="1082922">Your Honor, it's our position that the existence or nonexistence of a Federal exclusionary remedy for a McLaughlin violation is unnecessary to the disposition of this case because Nevada has its own State law remedy, essentially a State law McNabb-Mallory rule, which on remand, once it is... once it is required to properly apply McLaughlin to this case, will kick in.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.291" offset="1191069">And that's why we've cited a number of--</text>

            <text syncTime="270.589" offset="1232238">--We submit that it would have to be excluded under Federal and State law, because we submit on the merits that there should be a Federal exclusionary remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.494" offset="1263899">We submit that that issue also is not necessary to the disposition of the case because of the existence of a State law remedy for that violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.929" offset="1301620">That's why we have cited Welsh v. Wisconsin and other cases in our reply brief in which very similar situations have arisen in which a Federal constitutional violation implicates a State law remedy in which this Court has not proceeded to the Federal exclusionary remedy that would be required, if any, but remands for consideration under the State law remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="312.877" offset="1401407">Mr. Pescetta, I'm sure that is one of our options, and I guess in my mind whether it's an option we should take or not depends on the probability that Nevada will decide the exclusionary issue in a way which is, number one, dispositive of the case and, B, strictly on State law grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.147" offset="1462429">If there were a reasonable likelihood of decision on Federal grounds, then it seems to me it might be prudent for us to go further here.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.474" offset="1495762">Can you... can you tell me categorically that in fact Nevada's State law rule, as distinct from Nevada's readiness to follow any Federal exclusionary rule, would be, so far as you understand it, dispositive in this case?</text>

            <text syncTime="363.634" offset="1604431">Or to say we started out with a question about arraignment under Nevada law, and then we picked up McLaughlin on our own and made a mistake in failing to understand that it is retroactive, and then we returned and, in fact, our decision was about the arraignment Nevada State law ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.857" offset="1681335">Couldn't this case go back and the Nevada Supreme Court could say thank you for the instruction about McLaughlin, we now understand that it's retroactive, it was never raised by Powell, our decision on arraignment stands just the way we wrote it?</text>
            <text syncTime="398.839" offset="1745283">Just take out those paragraphs about McLaughlin and we've got a decision based solely on State law.</text>

            <text syncTime="409.858" offset="1789273">I would submit that once this Court is properly invested with jurisdiction over the Federal question, which it is, this Court's responsibility is to decide the Federal question.</text>

            <text syncTime="440.249" offset="1910900">Your Honor, what I was suggesting in answer to Justice O'Connor's question was that since there is a State law remedy available for the Federal law violation, that this Court need not proceed to delineate the scope of the Federal exclusionary remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.581" offset="1988222">I submit that... what I believed Justice Souter's question was was that if this is remanded and if the Nevada Supreme Court decides the McLaughlin issue on the merits, as I believe it must, the availability of the State law remedy will result in reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.300" offset="2051125">That's our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.123" offset="2058335">Now if their... if the Nevada Supreme... I would agree that the Nevada Supreme Court could do any number of things.</text>

            <text syncTime="1605.385" offset="6571458">Immediately after at least the booking procedure, the police officer who was in charge of the arrest, in this case Detective Al Leavitt, would fill out what is known as the affidavit of probable cause, along with other papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.836" offset="6633211">Copies of those and the original would go to various places.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.159" offset="6650557">One of them would go to the Justice of the Peace across the street in the courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.605" offset="6672291">That Justice of the Peace, in those days, within 72 hours, excluding weekends and holidays, would read the declaration and determine whether or not there was probable cause to hold the prisoner for any greater length of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.415" offset="6731536">Completely separate and apart from the procedure in Nevada, at that time and today, is the procedure of first appearance, and that is governed entirely by NRS, Nevada Revised Statute 171.178.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.527" offset="6799977">And that statute really says just about the same thing, that within 72 hours, excluding weekends and holidays, the prisoner must be brought before the Justice of the Peace for a first appearance, at which time that person is then advised of the various rights that attach to his proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.740" offset="6884823">So that the Court understands fully, the procedures then are similar in that the time limitations put forth by the legislature in the first appearance statute were used as guidelines by Nevada officials or police officers in determining how quickly they had to obey the prompt dictate of Gerstein.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.578" offset="6988163">And they chose to utilize the 72 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.701" offset="7008643">The defendant in this case has never, until coming before this Court, objected to any sort of a probable cause difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.170" offset="7050544">It has always been couched in terms of a delay in first appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.045" offset="7070083">And, indeed, the Nevada Supreme Court began its opinion in this particular area, recognizing that that was the specific claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.101" offset="7102266">Now, since I would prefer to spend most of my time discussing the substantive issues that are before this Court relative to the exclusionary rule, I would like to say a brief word about jurisdiction and then go on to that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.562" offset="7164124">As I stated, the issue has always been framed in terms of first appearance and not in probable cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2609.779" offset="10588986">And the Court in Harris seemed to indicate that the custody, albeit the... for the Payton violation, that custody was still lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.135" offset="10630469">And in this case, I would say that the custody is still lawful even though there is a delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.681" offset="10652620">There is a Fourth Amendment violation because of the delay, but it doesn't render the custody unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.093" offset="10678220">And the confession or statement, then, is not a product of the delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.008" offset="10701940">It, like the one in Harris, is the product of the probable cause arrest, an appropriate arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2651.847" offset="10757319">They are then entitled to go ask questions of him, which they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.722" offset="10780725">And we have to remember that... as was brought out in the earlier argument, that those same statements were gotten from him several times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.912" offset="10825551">Six times before, I believe, he told people how these particular injuries occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.117" offset="10850315">He was more than willing, in fact even eager to tell that story.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.801" offset="10869123">And so there can be no reasonable assumption, I believe, here that the statements in question were in any way the product of some sort of a delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.738" offset="10916875">Had the delay not happened, we still would have had the statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.110" offset="10930354">He still would have been willing to tell us the same thing that he told us on other occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.636" offset="10952402">The other reason for the nonutilization of the exclusionary rule in this case are the line of cases having to do with good faith, and those cases teach us that when police officers reasonably rely on presumptively valid statutes or search warrants, that to exclude the things that come from those valid pieces of evidence is to... thank you very much.</text>

            <text syncTime="2750.618" offset="11152395">I would like to start by answering the question that was posed at the outset concerning the possibility of State remedies, and by saying that there is no reason to think in this case that there is any State remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.636" offset="11204431">In Powell's view, the State court in this case, A, found that the Fourth Amendment was blatantly violated but, B, refused to give a Federal remedy based on what everyone now says is a wrong view of Federal retroactivity rule... rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.809" offset="11289068">If there were indeed... if there were indeed a separate and independent State remedy, the Supreme Court of Nevada, by hypothesis having found that the Fourth Amendment was violated, surely would have granted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.799" offset="11341104">And indeed it is a little bit strange that the principle authority cited for the claim that there is an independent State remedy in this court is the opinion of the Supreme Court of Nevada in this case which, if it stands for anything, is that there is no State remedy for--</text>

            <text syncTime="2816.983" offset="11417799">Well, why would it give a State remedy for a statute which it found was inapplicable because of its misunderstanding of retroactivity?</text>

            <text syncTime="2829.761" offset="11468895">The Supreme Court of Nevada stated in its opinion that there is a remedy, much like the McNabb-Mallory remedy, for the violation of its statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.582" offset="11528245">It also stated that as a matter of State law, that right is waiveable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.606" offset="11548307">Now, neither of those two statements have anything to do with the error of Federal law that the court made, which is to say that as a matter of Federal law there is no Federal remedy available in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.435" offset="11611628">If we concede the premise for this Court's having jurisdiction, which is the claim that the Supreme Court of Nevada necessarily found a Fourth Amendment violation in this case, then it must follow that there can be no independent State remedy for that since if there were, the court surely would have given it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3201.064" offset="12954113">On the other hand, the Court... this Court has always held that it does not sit to overturn statements in opinions, and if there is nothing wrong with the judgment as a matter of Federal law, and we say there is not despite the error in the statement, then the judgment should not be overturned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.437" offset="13035615">In our view, there is nothing wrong with the judgment as a matter of Federal law because, as a matter of Federal law, the statement is not a fruit of the timing violation on which the petitioner relies, and the good faith exception would apply to bar suppression even if the statement is deemed a fruit in the circumstances of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3362.801" offset="13601113">The answer to Justice Ginsburg's question about what happens if the Nevada Supreme Court says we are not going to decide this issue, is that would then not be an adequate State ground for the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.657" offset="13644477">We submit that if the Nevada Supreme Court adopts a procedural bar rule that says we will forgive procedural bars so long as we don't have to reverse, but we will invoke procedural bars so long as we can affirm, that's not an independent and adequate State ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.848" offset="13701319">And that I submit is the short answer to your concern about what happens if the case goes back.</text>

            <text syncTime="3446.898" offset="13937466">I submit that's entirely anomalous to say on the one hand it has nothing to do with the probable cause determination, but on the other hand that's the good faith reliance on the statute that invokes Illinois v. Krull.</text>
