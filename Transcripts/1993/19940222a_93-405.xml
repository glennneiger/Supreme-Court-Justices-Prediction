            <text syncTime="24.096" offset="245497">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice; may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="26.038" offset="253229">This case is here from the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.609" offset="267544">That court held that petitioner Digital Equipment must await the end of trial before appealing the district court's denial of its claim that it had the right to avoid trial altogether pursuant to its settlement agreement with respondent Desktop Direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.559" offset="327312">The district court had rescinded that settlement agreement and vacated Desktop Direct's dismissal after finding that a factfinder could conclude that Digital failed to disclose facts to Desktop that would cause Desktop not to accept the settlement offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.040" offset="397216">The Tenth Circuit refused to hear Digital's appeal from that ruling under the collateral order doctrine because it determined that the issue of the enforceability of settlement agreements was not "important enough" to justify appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="78.152" offset="461686">Mr. Roberts, the district court order seemed to indicate that the district court thought there was a factfinding determination necessary on whether the settlement agreement should be set aside.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="101.668" offset="555727">And the appeal taken was on the theory that no fact finding could be allowed on that question?</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="109.173" offset="585820">Well, there are a number of grounds for appeal, the first being that that is the wrong standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.814" offset="600344">He threw out the settlement agreement, vacated the dismissal with prejudice because a factfinder could determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.550" offset="631273">That's plainly the wrong standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.533" offset="643289">At the very least, a factfinder should find fraud, and we think must find fraud under clear and convincing evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.776" offset="668158">That was not done here, but there is a final decision on the validity of the settlement agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.878" offset="684667">The settlement agreement has been thrown out.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.661" offset="691773">The motion to rescind it was granted, and as the Tenth Circuit found, that's all the district court is going to do on that issue.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="142.743" offset="720089">Suppose the trial court had made findings on the factual issues, making a finding that the Digital Corporation did know of the Desktop name, could the ruling in those findings then be the subject of a separate appeal?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="161.597" stopTime="168.851">
            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="161.597" offset="795531">Yes, Your Honor, because the issue on appeal is the validity of the settlement agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.489" offset="815070">That is what gives us our right to avoid trial.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="168.851" offset="824475">But that's not separable from the merits, that's right at the heart of the merits... what the Digital Corporation knew and when they knew it.</text>

            <text syncTime="176.848" offset="856448">The Tenth Circuit found that the issue on appeal was separable from the merits and it was correct, for this reason: the merits concern the validity of their claim that we violated their trademark rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.373" offset="898558">They filed that complaint, of course, before any settlement discussions took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.885" offset="916635">They presumably felt that all they needed to know was there at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.889" offset="932621">Now, the issue of the validity of the settlement agreement raises entirely different questions about what was said during negotiations, what was not said.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="203.204" offset="961879">Well, suppose there were a finding that Digital knew at the time the agreement was negotiated and beforehand, and before it began using the Desktop name, that Desktop had a trademark interest in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.464" offset="1018930">It seems to me that that is highly relevant to the substantive litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="222.677" offset="1039828">I think the most that can be said is that their allegations with respect to the settlement may be relevant on damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.060" offset="1065324">That's the only thing that they allege at this point, but even there, it is, as the court has said in Mitchell v. Forsyth, conceptually distinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.298" offset="1102313">In Mitchell v. Forsyth, of course, there was complete overlap on the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.208" offset="1117986">The question was qualified immunity, and you needed to know what the allegations were before you could judge that, but the court said because in Mitchell you take as true the allegations and ask if that violated a substantive legal standard, that was conceptually distinct from whether or not the allegations were true.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.350" offset="1182457">Same thing here.</text>

            <text syncTime="263.823" offset="1204399">You seem to present an agreement between the parties that meet the first two requirements, but this is a jurisdictional question, is it not?</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="281.314" offset="1274408">And Justice O'Connor started to ask you about the... a factfinder could find.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.829" offset="1292380">Let me put it to you this way: suppose you lose here, and we say there is no immediate appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.291" offset="1318293">Are you foreclosed from going back to the lower court and saying, the district judge said only a trier could find... a trier could find the other way, so we would like you now to determine that question finally, and if you determine it in our favor, the settlement will indeed stick.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.577" offset="1415364">Are you foreclosed from making such an argument?</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="319.479" offset="1427067">Yes, and let me be precise.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.910" offset="1436785">We are foreclosed, as we understand the record and as I gather Desktop understands it as well, from arguing the validity of the settlement agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.168" offset="1469804">That has been decided, but... and it is important to emphasize... no one has found fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.719" offset="1487985">We are not foreclosed from arguing whether on damages or some other issue, that there was no fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.772" offset="1508151">The error in the district court's ruling is that he vacated the settlement agreement without making any findings with respect to fraud at all, so yes, we are foreclosed from arguing the validity of the settlement agreement, but not from arguing that there was no fraud.</text>

            <text syncTime="357.165" offset="1577741">Supposing on remand you lose, but then you appeal, and after... you know, assume we don't agree with your present appeal, and after months of litigation you ultimately prevail and have the court of appeals rule that the settlement agreement was indeed valid from the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.123" offset="1637614">It therefore would follow, would it not, that they had breached the settlement agreement, and you would be entitled to damages for all that happened in the interim?</text>

            <text syncTime="1762.039" offset="7197307">In our view, that contention is 180 degrees wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="2505.195" offset="10169937">The petitioner's entire case depends on this Court's acceptance of its premise that the essence of the right it claims is the right not to stand trial, but the premise itself fails.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.713" offset="10223959">First, as already discussed, the right not to go to trial in the sense relevant to Cohen must be rooted in the Constitution or in statutory law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.459" offset="10258963">Second, under the standards set by this Court in Van Cauwenberghe and Midland Asphalt, the essence of the claim here is something other than a right not to stand trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.536" offset="10303266">The Court pointed out in Van Cauwenberghe that in some sense any litigant who has a meritorious pretrial basis for dismissal has a right not to go to trial, and that is true across a broad range of possible defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.250" offset="10382156">If the case is dismissed on statute of limitations grounds or on personal jurisdictional grounds, there will be no trial, and it was for this reason that the Court cautioned in Midland Asphalt that we must not play word games in this area with what is really the essence of the right not to go to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.831" offset="10456448">We submit that... oh, we submit that where you have an option between two characterizations, two interpretations, one of which will increase the number of interlocutory appeals contrary to the plain language of section 1291, and the other of which will control the number of those interlocutory appeals, that under Van Cauwenberghe and Midland the better approach clearly is to limit rather than to increase--</text>

            <text syncTime="2659.947" offset="10788935">But there are three other options that are equally acceptable as a matter of appropriate English language, one is that what they really wanted was a bottom line decision as to how much money they were going to have to pay.</text>

            <text syncTime="2676.337" offset="10854450">Second is that they wanted the lawsuit settled, and behind them, and the third is, they wanted the use of the trademark.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.881" offset="10876602">Now, when you have that kind of a choice between picking... between characterizations that will increase interlocutory appeals and those that will control them, Van Cauwenberghe very clearly said which of those choices we should make, and that language is as follows:</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.984" offset="10961030">Because of the important interests furthered by the final judgment rule, and the ease... the ease with which certain pretrial claims for dismissal may be alleged to entail the right not to stand trial, we should examine the nature of the right asserted with special care.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.728" offset="11036053">Now, if you apply that special care test to the facts of this case, I submit common sense tells you that the essence of this claim, even without the Van Cauwenberghe tilt, tells you that the essence of the claim was not the right not to stand trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.318" offset="11106375">We're dealing here with a huge corporation, and their lawyers and their employees are in court every day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.171" offset="11133751">It just defies common sense that what they really wanted was to avoid one more courtroom in the district of Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.878" offset="11164576">I submit that what common sense tells us is that what they really wanted was the bottom line determination as to how much money they were going to own... they were going to owe, get the obligation of the lawsuit out of the way, and acquire the right to the trademark.</text>

            <text syncTime="2964.575" offset="12007390">The only thing we are saying is that, as the Chief Justice mentioned a moment ago, the Court has said that this is, whether you call it an interpretation of the word final, or an exception to the Cohen rule of law, has made very clear it is to be very narrowly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.935" offset="12068830">On occasion it has used the term, utmost strictness, and our only point with respect to 1292(b) is that that is another reason to continue with that strict approach, because in the event you do have some truly meritorious cases that really do need to be appealed by breaking up the trial right in the middle of it, the safety valve, there is another safety valve applicable to 1292(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.313" offset="12174365">That does not say that you overrule Cohen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.145" offset="12181679">All it says is that the momentum that I see building in recent years toward a narrow construction of the Cohen rule should continue.</text>

            <text syncTime="3020.333" offset="12230476">As I count them up, in any collateral order case, any one, there are at least four requirements which this Court... by which this Court has controlled access to interlocutory appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.813" offset="12296409">They are the three that are stated by Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, except that the second one, Justice Ginsburg, is really two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.078" offset="12329428">It's the separateness, and importance, so you really have those four.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.110" offset="12341549">But in a case involving an asserted right to avoid trial, you have two more, because of the Midland Asphalt rule and because of this characterization problem that we've been talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.680" offset="12395779">So at a maximum, six hurdles that you have to get over, six controls... six control points by which this Court can limit the number of interlocutory appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.386" offset="12430679">The only way that the petitioner can win this case is for the Court to say that three of those six no longer count, and I submit that to do so would be squarely inconsistent with what this Court cautioned in Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber when it said that such a movement would, and I quote from the Court, transform the limited exception carved out in Cohen into a license for broad disregard for the finality rule imposed by Congress in section 1291.</text>

            <text syncTime="3189.324" offset="12906421">Our right is the right to avoid trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.004" offset="12913108">We will lose that right altogether if we have to go to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.277" offset="12926169">Now, is it true that that right secures other rights in interest?</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.309" offset="12938290">Of course, but that is true in every case under Cohen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.010" offset="12949157">The Double Jeopardy defendant has an interest in avoiding trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.353" offset="12962532">If he pursues that interest, it also protects the interest in not being found guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.066" offset="12977369">That's not a distinguishing factor in this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.179" offset="12993774">Is Cohen an interpretation of 1291, or a judicial exception to the rules of jurisdiction created by Congress?</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.761" offset="13020106">It's the former.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.023" offset="13025226">I'm not aware of any authority that this Court has to create exceptions to the jurisdictional rules that Congress creates, and even though the term, final decisions, is subject to interpretation, it doesn't mean that all bets are off and the Court can say, we're going to allow an appeal of issues that we think are important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.383" offset="13090636">Think of how that would look in the different circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.246" offset="13098055">Different circuits will have very different views of what's important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.406" offset="13106728">The issues in securities cases may seem important to the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.110" offset="13121565">Issues in mining cases may seem important to the Tenth Circuit, and this Court would have to umpire all of those decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.775" offset="13148210">The word importance does appear, my brother counted, 15 or 16 times.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.566" offset="13163361">Never has that word been used to support an analysis such as that engaged in by the Tenth Circuit below... not once.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.300" offset="13190319">Finally, on the statute of limitations cases, the distinction again is set forth in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.723" offset="13211949">They are not a right not to be tried, they're a right to be tried within a certain period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.118" offset="13229608">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
