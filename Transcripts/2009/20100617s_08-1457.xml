            <text syncTime="9.936" offset="145178">In December of 2007, The National Labor Relations Board had one vacancy and four members.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.951" offset="181227">The board expected two more members, two more vacancies at the end of the year just a few away, which would leave the Board with only two members.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.143" offset="221978">Too few to meet the quorum requirement in The National Labor Relations Act which requires three members.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.298" offset="250608">The four sitting members attempted to preserve the Board’s ability to function by delegating all of the Board’s powers to a group of three members with the expectation that when the term expired for one of the group members a few days later, the remaining two members could continue to issue decisions, as a quorum of that three-member group.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.980" offset="341305">For the next 27 months, the Board issued decisions with only two members.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.708" offset="368264">Petitioners sought review of two of those decisions challenging the authority of the two member board to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.186" offset="398148">The Seventh Circuit ruled that the government including that the two members could properly act for the entire board.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.739" offset="424375">We granted certiorari to resolve the circuit split on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.555" offset="443601">For the reasons stated in opinion filed with the clerk, we hold that the two remaining board members could not exercise the board’s authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.273" offset="478501">The portion of the Act that allows the board to delegate its authority to a group of no fewer than three members must be read to require that the group maintain a membership of three in order to continue to exercise the board’s powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.936" offset="545165">The contrary reading allowing two members to exercise authority as a quorum of the defunct three-member group would allow permanent circumvention of a quorum requirement for the board which demands three members.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.213" offset="614233">We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.750" offset="628443">Justice Kennedy has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer and Justice Sotomayor have joined.</text>
