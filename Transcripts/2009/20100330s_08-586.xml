            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="6.795" offset="132639">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.813" offset="156672">Section 36B of the Investment Company act of 1940 imposes a fiduciary duty on investment advisors with respect to the receipt of compensation for services provided to the mutual funds they manage.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.950" offset="221247">The petitioners who are shareholders in mutual funds managed by respondent investment advisor filed this suit alleging that respondent violated the fiduciary duty by charging excessive fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.321" offset="274745">For the reasons set out in our opinion, we conclude that the appropriate standard for determining whether an investment advisor has violated its fiduciary duty is the standard outlined by the Second Circuit over 25 years ago in Gartenberg versus Merrill Lynch Asset Management Inc.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.130" offset="349978">Under the Gartenberg standard, to be guilty of a violation of section 36B an investment adviser must charge a fee, that is so disproportionately large it bears no reasonable relationship to the services rendered and could not have been the product of arms length bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.581" offset="427719">This standard reflects the meaning of the term fiduciary duty as described in our analogous cases as well as section 30-6B's place in the statutory scheme because the Court of Appeals declined to adopt the Gartenberg standard, we vacate and remand for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.748" offset="500443">The judgment of court is unanimous, Justice Thomas has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
