            <text syncTime="10.789" offset="149650">Respondents are natural gas suppliers who object to the way Ohio taxes them.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.443" offset="168249">Their suit belongs in State court rather than Federal court for two independent reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.062" offset="186744">First, principles of comity and federalism dictate that the State court should resolve challenges to the validity of their own tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.917" offset="218091">And second, the Tax Injunction Act squarely prohibits Federal courts from issuing declaratory judgments holding State tax laws unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.339" offset="251841">Although either of these grounds would independently support reversal of the Sixth Circuit here, the analysis can really begin and end with the comity doctrine, because that is where the lower courts have shown confusion in the--</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="48.581" offset="300743">Before you get into that, I have a question that there may be an obvious answer to, but I haven't found it.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.218" offset="319342">My understanding is -- it's a standing question.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.587" offset="336792">My understanding is that they are asking as relief, and the only relief they ask for, is to raise the taxes of a competitor.</text>

            <text syncTime="69.158" offset="383080">Okay.</text>
            <text offset="382976">If that's correct, I have found no case that -- I haven't looked that hard, but certainly no case in this Court -- that said there is standing for a firm to challenge the taxes of a competitor where the remedy is: Raise his taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.934" offset="446192">If there were standing for such a thing, it would -- I'm surprised that there aren't competitors all over the country doing business out of State bringing diversity cases in Federal court, saying: My competitor's taxes should increase; it's all very complicated, but the Commissioner didn't properly follow State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.747" offset="525396">Now, I have found no case, certainly not in this Court, which said: Where all you want is to raise the tax of a competitor, you have standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.453" offset="568236">So perhaps this is well-settled that you can do it, but I thought I would raise that for both of you at the beginning in case there is something you want to say about it, which might save me a little time looking it all up.</text>

            <text syncTime="133.997" offset="642424">And to address the standing point directly, it's because they do claim an injury that is cognizable.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.699" offset="665203">Under Dennis v. Higgins, they are claiming a dormant Commerce Clause injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="144.167" offset="683071">I have no doubt, and the standing rule I think is clear, that if we're saying because I am injured, and they have injury, you can't -- you must give me reduction in my tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.725" offset="733330">That's what those cases say.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.325" offset="739704">I have no problem with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.241" offset="743361">Absolutely clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.260" offset="747436">You can do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.926" offset="750153">But where all you want is to raise somebody else's taxes, that I had thought -- and probably wrongly, but I had thought there is a prudential standing rule that says you cannot bring such a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.853" offset="809817">And I don't see why you should be able to.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.586" offset="816818">It seems to me it would be a nightmare if you could, which doesn't surprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.121" offset="834894">So there we are.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.021" offset="838552">That's the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.340" offset="843776">And you will tell me: No, it's all clear; they can do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.958" offset="854225">And I would like some citation or something and explain why they should be able to do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="400.987" offset="1710414">--To be frank, I don't know if Pullman was -- was specifically cited, but that's because Fair Assessment itself, which was heavily cited in the lower courts, incorporates the principles of Pullman and Burford and says that these tax questions raise -- that these tax challenges raise questions about the meaning of State law, about the operation of a complicated regulatory regime, and so they are better left to the State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.389" offset="1815949">The -- the application of the State law here is particularly disruptive, because the tax laws being challenged intersect integrally with the regulatory regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.462" offset="1864328">Just to give one example, among the taxes that Respondents are objecting to is the gross receipts tax, which public utilities, the local distribution companies, pay, but the non-public utilities like Respondents do not pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.241" offset="1927440">The gross receipts tax is relevant on both the tax and regulatory side of the ledger, because it's a tax but it's then also a cost that as we explain at page 6 of the blue brief, may be included in the gas cost recovery formula for the rate that the public utilities may charge their customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.004" offset="2010509">And those rates are approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.289" offset="2027645">So if the gross receipts tax is eliminated, it will affect the regulatory side of things as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="515.741" offset="2169438">Does that -- are those -- does that capture it or is there something more?</text>

            <text syncTime="521.375" offset="2191903">And I think the third point is really just an additional explanation of the first two points, because in an establishment clause challenge like Hibbs, the remedy is often going to be very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.349" offset="2243835">In Hibbs, for example, there was a credit being challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.782" offset="2253552">And the Federal court could simply pull the thread of that credit, and the rest of the fabric of the Arizona tax scheme would remain intact.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.705" offset="2285213">Here, by contrast, if the thread of the gross receipts -- sorry, of the sales tax and the commercial activities tax is pulled, the fabric of the State's taxation and regulatory regime will unravel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1308.058" offset="5338718">It also would mean that the regulatory side of thing would be affected, which brings us back to the Burford principles we discussed earlier, because the taxes, as I said, are integrally connected to the way Ohio regulates public utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.050" offset="5394620">And those public utilities have obligations to a captive market that the Respondents don't have to meet.</text>
