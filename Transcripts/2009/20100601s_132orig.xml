            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Justice Scalia has our opinion this morning in original action 132, Alabama against North Carolina.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="8.241" stopTime="541.257">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="8.241" offset="136338">This case is before us pursuant to our original jurisdiction over suits between the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.106" offset="163819">In 1986, Congress granted its consent to the Southeast Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Compact which originally had eight party states, including North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.162" offset="224005">The compact is administered by a Commission which was required among other things to “identify a host state for the development of a new regional facility for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste."</text>
            <text syncTime="47.708" offset="294222">The Commission designated North Carolina as a host state, thereby obligating it to take, and this the language of the Compact, appropriate steps to ensure that an application for a license to construct and operate a low-level radioactive waste storage facility is filed with and issued by the appropriate authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.269" offset="392443">In 1988, North Carolina asked the Commission for assistance with the substantial costs of licensing and building a facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.280" offset="432462">The Commission adopted a resolution declaring it “appropriate and necessary” to provide financial assistance and ultimately paid almost $80 million to North Carolina from 1988 through 1997.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.938" offset="503097">The Commission acquired that money from fees paid by generators of low-level radioactive waste at the expend disposal facility in Barnwell, South Carolina which the new facility was ultimately supposed to replace.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.604" offset="561821">North Carolina also expended $34 million of its own funds, yet by the mid 1990s, North Carolina was still many years and many tens of millions of dollars away from obtaining a license and constructing a facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.049" offset="631620">In 1997, the Commission notified North Carolina that absent a plan for funding the remaining steps of the licensing process, it would not provide any additional funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.029" offset="679476">North Carolina responded that it could not continue without external funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.103" offset="699747">After the parties fail to agree on a financing plan, in December 1997 the Commission ceased its financial assistance to North Carolina and North Carolina ceased taking steps towards obtaining a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.872" offset="758888">In June 1999, Florida and Tennessee filed a complaint with the Commission seeking monetary sanctions against North Carolina and the next month, North Carolina withdrew from the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.874" offset="810820">In December 1999, the Commission determined that North Carolina had failed to fulfill its obligation to take appropriate steps under the Compact and adopted a resolution demanding that the state repay the approximately $80 million and in addition pay other monetary penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.393" offset="884903">North Carolina did not comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.680" offset="898069">In 2003, we granted the plaintiffs’ here, four states; Alabama, Florida, Tennessee and Virginia plus the Commission leave to file a bill of complaint against North Carolina under our original jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.299" offset="960554">The complaint alleges claims of violation of the state's rights under the Compact count one, breach of contract count two, unjust enrichment count three, promissory estoppel count four and money hadn’t received count five, [Laughter] and requests money and other relief including a declaration that North Carolina is subject to sanctions and that the Commission's sanctions resolution is valid and enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.686" offset="1106108">We assigned the case to a Special Master who filed two reports, making recommendations with respect to each of the foregoing claims and with respect to North Carolina's motion to dismiss certain claims on grounds of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.950" offset="1163160">The parties fined nine exceptions to the Master’s reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.828" offset="1178728">For the reasons provided in our opinion, we overrule all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.099" offset="1195760">We first conclude that the express terms of the Compact do not authorize the Commission to impose monetary sanctions against North Carolina and since that is so we reject it as moot the plaintiffs’ argument that North Carolina could not avoid monetary sanctions by withdrawing from the Compact and we deem plaintiffs’ argument that North Carolina forfeited its right to object to monetary sanctions abandoned but in any event without merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.254" offset="1300355">We also reject plaintiffs’ argument that we are bound by or should defer to the Commission's conclusion that North Carolina breached the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.952" offset="1335150">The terms of the Compact do not make the Commission the sole arbiter of disputes arising under it and hence we are not bound by the Commission's conclusion, nor do we apply deferential administrative law standards of review, but instead as the exclusive arbiter of controversies between the states, we exercise our own independent judgment as to both fact and law.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.036" offset="1439535">We further reject plaintiffs’ primary argument that North Carolina breached its obligation under Article 5(c) of the Compact to take appropriate steps towards obtaining a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.319" offset="1480600">The Compact requires North Carolina to take only those licensing steps that are appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.382" offset="1504946">The party’s course of performance establishes that it was not appropriate for North Carolina to proceed with a very expensive licensing process when it had become clear that it will receive no further financial assistance for that purpose, and when it appeared that even if the license were obtained there would be no funding for construction of the facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.676" offset="1586030">The Compact does not require North Carolina to cover all licensing and building costs on its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.798" offset="1610585">We reject plaintiffs’ argument that North Carolina breached an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing when it withdrew from the Compact in June 1999.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.546" offset="1649560">We have never held that an Interstate Compact includes such a duty and we decline to do so here.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.809" offset="1674637">The Compact by its terms imposes no limitation on South Carolina's right to exercise its statutory right under article 7(g) to withdraw.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.574" offset="1717687">We also overrule North Carolina's two exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.715" offset="1734196">It was reasonable for the Special Master to deny without prejudice north Carolina's motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs' equitable claims counts 3-5.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.649" offset="1774007">The Special Master concluded that those claims require further briefing, argument and possibly, discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.365" offset="1800861">We granted the Special Master, the discretion to manage the proceedings in this case and we approve of his reasonable case management decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.474" offset="1833253">The Special Master was also correct to deny without prejudice North Carolina's motion to dismiss the Commission's claims on grounds of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.632" offset="1873899">The Commission of course is not a state and hence cannot take advantage of the state's consent to suit by other states in this Court that the Constitution contains.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.605" offset="1913814">Under a case called Arizona versus California, however, we held that a non-state can join the suit by states so long as it asserts the same claims and seeks the same relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.158" offset="1963969">With respect to counts 1 and 2 the Commission's claims under those Compact related counts are wholly derivative of the plaintiff states' claims. Counts 3 to 5 however are on a different footing.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.530" offset="2021543">The Special Master concluded that further the factual and legal development is necessary to determine whether the Commission's claims under those counts were identical to those of the plaintiff states.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.449" offset="2065220">We conclude the Special Master's case management decision was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.141" offset="2087894">In sum we grant North Carolina's motions to dismiss count 1 and for summary judgment on count 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.944" offset="2115166">We deny plaintiffs’ motions for summary judgment on counts 1 and 2 and we deny without prejudice North Carolina's motions to dismiss the Commission's claims on sovereign immunity grounds and for summary judgment under counts 3 to 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.906" offset="2175039">Justice Kennedy has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment in which Justice Sotomayor has joined. The Chief Justice has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which Justice Thomas has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.547" offset="2233553">Justice Breyer has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which the Chief Justice has joined.</text>
