            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We will hear argument first this morning in Case 132 on our original docket, Alabama v. North Carolina.</text>

            <text syncTime="7.667" offset="134040">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: North Carolina breached the Southeast Compact in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.382" offset="160893">Whether you examine it from the perspective of the sanctions that were imposed by the Commission, or whether you evaluate it from the perspective of the repeated statements by the executives of the Commission that there had been a material breach and a repudiation, or whether you examine it from the perspective of the undisputed record that was collected by the Special Master, the conclusion, it seems to me, is inescapable that what North Carolina did here by taking no action between December 1997 and July of 1996 simply does not fulfill the responsibilities that they had -- that North Carolina had assumed, and therefore the only issue should be: What is the appropriate remedy for this extraordinary breach?</text>
            <text syncTime="56.337" offset="328704">To go to the specific record, just to be clear about this, the Special Master says at page 10 of his report:</text>
            <text syncTime="62.190" offset="352110">"The parties do not dispute that North Carolina did not take additional steps to pursue a license for a waste facility during that period. "</text>
            <text syncTime="70.436" offset="385128">Our undisputed statement of facts is that North Carolina took no further steps to license between 1997 and 1999.</text>

            <text syncTime="78.946" offset="419192">Mr. Phillips, the point that North Carolina makes is it would be throwing away the taxpayers' money to no purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.647" offset="457958">That is, what is the point of continuing to pursue a license when North Carolina does not have the funding to continue the process and to open the disposal facility?</text>
            <text syncTime="104.280" offset="520443">So North Carolina's point of view is: What does it mean to continue to seek the license when they are not going to have the money to get to the end of the line?</text>

            <text syncTime="113.994" offset="559313">Well, North Carolina assumed the responsibility more than a decade prior to that time to take all appropriate steps in order to provide for licensing and for construction of a facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.507" offset="601422">"Appropriate steps" in that context has to mean something more than simply doing nothing, declaring categorically that you are going to repudiate the agreement, and attempting to extort from the compact and its Commission additional monies that it is absolutely clear that the Commission has no responsibility to North Carolina to pay.</text>

            <text syncTime="1838.753" offset="7458356">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The United States has participated in this case both, at the Court's invitation, at the motion for leave to file stage and then before the Special Master, primarily on the issues that were addressed in the Special Master's preliminary report, which go to questions of the assertion of Eleventh Amendment immunity in original actions as well as the structure of the compact and the compact's power to assess monetary sanctions itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.524" offset="7573504">Today we make two principal arguments: one, that the Court should deny North Carolina's motion to dismiss the Commission as a party, rejecting at this time or for the time being the assertion of Eleventh Amendment immunity; and second, that the Court should deny the claim that the Commission has the power itself to impose monetary sanctions under article 7(F).</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.762" offset="7674441">That's not to say that the States party may not seek monetary relief, appropriate monetary relief, themselves in an original action in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.713" offset="7706206">It's only to say that the compact Commission is not a forum established by the compact itself, which is not only a compact between the States, but an Act of Congress, to do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1940.118" offset="7863881">It seems to be putting the cart before the horse, or -- because I'm not sure why we should be reaching the merits, deciding the merits, before identifying which are the parties and what claims they have before us.</text>

            <text syncTime="1986.225" offset="8048306">They are parties to the compact, and as parties to the compact, they can bring an action whether or not the Commission is properly before -- before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.298" offset="8080593">And the question of whether the -- North Carolina violated the compact therefore can be adjudicated solely on the basis of -- of the plaintiff States' claim, without having to reach the question of -- of whether the Commission could properly be made a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.994" offset="8139316">If this Court were to agree with the Special Master that there was no violation of the compact, then the question of whether the Commission could be -- could also bring that claim and what -- what remedy there might be for that, either to the States or to the Commission, would never have to be-to be reached.</text>

            <text syncTime="2117.997" offset="8575352">In Maryland v. Louisiana, which was a suit brought by a number of States to challenge a -- a Louisiana tax on Commerce Clause grounds, that case went forward on the suit of the -- of those States, but the natural gas companies who paid the tax were permitted to intervene, and the Court did that, notwithstanding the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.238" offset="8660302">Surely, the claim of the States parens patriae was not identical to the claims of the individual natural gas companies to get a refund on their own behalf, but the Court nonetheless allowed them to intervene, and the Court's judgment in this case awarded -- required the State of Louisiana to make refunds to -- to all taxpayers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2305.634" offset="9325902">But beyond that, I think it's important to look at the overall structure of article 7, where the sanctions power appears.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.569" offset="9349622">First of all, article 7(F), which is on page 19a of the blue brief, refers to any party State which fails to comply, et cetera,</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.533" offset="9389537">"may be subject to sanctions, including suspension of rights under the compact and revocation. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.733" offset="9406255">Those are all forward-looking sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.264" offset="9416391">But -- but I think what really reinforces that is if you look at the title of article 7, which is on page 17a, it says -- it deals with eligible parties, withdrawal, revocation, entry into force, and termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.711" offset="9474173">Article 7 is all about membership in the -- in the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.132" offset="9491937">The Commission's powers, by contrast, are set out in article 4 of the -- of the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.832" offset="9518686">There are enumerated powers there and, for example, article 4(E)(11), on page 11a -- the only enumerated power with respect to sanctions there, at the bottom of 11a, is to revoke the membership of a party State in accordance with article 7(F).</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.655" offset="9585977">One would think, if there -- if there was an extraordinary power to grant monetary sanctions, that it would have appeared in the enumerated powers, and in fact, in the one compact adopted at the same time that provides for imposition of fines, it actually appears in the enumerated powers portion of the relevant compact, not in the membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.832" offset="9654732">And, Justice Breyer, you asked about section -- article 7(C), with respect to the power of the Commission to be the judge of -- of certain matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.140" offset="9691930">I think it's pretty clear that what that's driving at is the Commission being the judge of the qualifications of the -- of the States and the members of the Commission appointed by the States to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.717" offset="9742190">It's like the power of any legislative body, the power of Congress to determine the qualifications of someone who's about -- who has been voted in, should that person be seated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.370" offset="9776880">I think article 7(C) is directed at that, not at some power of--</text>

            <text syncTime="2644.412" offset="10681031">But it was because this is a consensual compact and because of the right to withdrawal, as the master noted, it would have been surprising if a facility were constructed without significant assistance from the States that were not the host State because of the right to withdraw, and that indeed was recognized from the very beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.422" offset="10777057">For example, in 1996, when the -- the chairman of the Commission was hoping to speed up the completion, the chairman noted that the opening of a new regional facility in North Carolina would ensure a source of revenues for site development in the third host State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.299" offset="10880606">Indeed, it's not surprising that, from the beginning of the compact, the Commission provided a substantial amount of the funding because North Carolina could have withdrawn at any point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.515" offset="10933478">And the Commission repeatedly recognized that it was, quote,</text>

            <text syncTime="2723.007" offset="10995440">Mr. Phillips cites the North Carolina legislation -- the North Carolina legislation, which notes that, among the Commission's -- the authority's corporate powers, when it sets up the authority or the financing -- but the North Carolina legislation, as the Commission expressly recognized and cited in providing the money, provides that North Carolina may accept funds from its general assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.589" offset="11113723">The North Carolina authority may accept funds from the North Carolina general assembly, from the Commission compact, from other States, from the Federal Government, or from generators.</text>

            <text syncTime="2766.943" offset="11171192">At every step, they -- the Commission says that in -- in February of '88, October of '89, September of '92, November of '92,</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.782" offset="11210480">"reasonable and equitable to provide this funding. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.811" offset="11222601">and of course it makes sense, given the consensual nature of the compact.</text>

            <text syncTime="2784.983" offset="11243290">Why did North Carolina quit?</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.826" offset="11250709">What happened was, because of the right to withdraw, South Carolina withdrew in 1995.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.885" offset="11278921">When South Carolina withdrew, this of course deprived the Commission of a ready source of funding from the fees that were being paid to the facility in Barnwell, South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.831" offset="11330748">But much -- or of equal significance is the fact that South Carolina, having withdrawn, no longer had to comply with the compact requirement, that South Carolina ceased operating a facility on December 31, 1992.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.199" offset="11400129">Why was that important?</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.826" offset="11406712">Because the compact creates, as Mr. Phillips noted, something like a monopoly within the region, and when you are financing the facility you know, if you are the financing authority, that you will have a captive market--</text>

            <text syncTime="2885.639" offset="11645889">Now, I don't know whether it is an appropriate step or not an appropriate step to keep the 80 million as well as running away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.384" offset="11676923">But it seems to me that we have an arbitrator that was supposed to decide whether it was or whether it wasn't, and they said it was an appropriate step.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.456" offset="11717151">They foresaw you would take the 80 million, never give it back, at least.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.396" offset="11728959">But the Commission thinks it isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.643" offset="11745991">And the arbitrator paid no attention whatsoever to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.298" offset="11768560">And what the Commission says in the language that I quoted is that the Commission is the judge of the members' compliance with the requirements of this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.856" offset="11814745">So when I read that, I think: Surely, he should have paid some attention to the fact that the Commission thought that what was keeping the 80 million was not an appropriate step.</text>

            <text syncTime="2945.567" offset="11885589">And the only answer I've heard so far is, if I read the rest of the sentence, it talks about laws of States relating to the enactment of this contract -- compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.642" offset="11929893">And I don't know that you read "enactment" so narrowly to refer to laws that talked about how you adopt it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.075" offset="11959672">There might be a whole lot of laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="3441.238" offset="13868283">So in -- in 1996, the joint supplemental fact brief at -- appendix at page 143, is where the head of the North Carolina authority writes to the head of the Commission and notes that, with the withdrawal of South Carolina and their decision to continue the operation at Barnwell, the financing options have been substantially changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.632" offset="13969951">Under the current compact, any State can withdraw up until the North Carolina facility becomes operational.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.645" offset="14001925">With an available alternative disposal facility now in South Carolina, there is no assurance to potential bondholders or financiers that there will be a revenue stream from which to repay any indebtedness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.891" offset="14066918">Therefore, the authority is in a position where the intended vehicles for financing are no longer possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.793" offset="14090533">One possibility is to modify the compact to preclude withdrawal from the compact, once the license is issued for the North Carolina facility, and that would -- such an amendment would allow -- future use of the facility would be assured, and revenue financing could be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.548" offset="14181543">It was not practical to submit that to all seven of the other -- all seven legislatures and to Congress, but the other problem is it would not have -- its -- its passage would, by no means, have been assured.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.731" offset="14238281">The States, at that moment, could either stay in or go.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.526" offset="14257507">So North Carolina is faced, after South Carolina's withdrawal, with the prospect of advancing -- trying to advance bonds for another, at minimum, $75 million for construction costs, which would bring the whole project up to 223 million, close to a quarter of a billion dollars, and with now a South Carolina facility that is closer to every State in the compact, except Virginia, and where, because it was built in 1981, it has a competitive cost advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.653" offset="14390000">So why is Georgia going to stay in the compact, when it has what may be a -- a less costly and less distant alternative in going to Barnwell, South Carolina?</text>

            <text syncTime="3611.261" offset="14548407">And we are told, in an amicus brief, that, if this compact is interpreted to allow one State to take advantage of another State's having done so for years and then run away and keep $80 million to boot, it will be impossible for many other States to resist that same route.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.814" offset="14630640">And that will be the end of compacts through the United States, and what we will have is low-level waste without storage.</text>

            <text syncTime="3690.292" offset="14864488">All that's possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.586" offset="14869713">But a decision in -- whether or not you decide for North Carolina, if that's what you want in a compact, you can have that compact, and nothing in a decision for North Carolina would change that.</text>

            <text syncTime="4736.019" offset="19047424">Alden makes this a civil case because Alden says that private suits against non-consenting States present the indignity of subjecting a State to the coercive processes of judicial tribunals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4750.575" offset="19105625">If you allow another party in that's not a State, you are subjecting a State to all of the discovery, all of the different theories, all of the depositions, all of the document requests.</text>

            <text syncTime="4773.021" offset="19195486">So I think this case is that -- I believe if you didn't want to overrule Arizona, you could say it's a case where the United States brought a case in its role as trustee for the Indian tribes and the tribes themselves were allowed to intervene, and they were, therefore, virtually one and the same party.</text>
            <text syncTime="4793.810" offset="19278660">And you wouldn't need to overrule it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4796.012" offset="19287437">I don't think, if it stands for any broader principle, it can survive Alden v. Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4801.667" offset="19310007">Now, if the Commission is out, then we think there is -- and if you agree that there was no breach of contract, then I think the Court should direct the dismissal of the quasi-contract claims because only the States will be left as a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="4816.240" offset="19368312">And those claims -- quasi-contract claims of restitution, it's -- they are claims that are governed by the subject matter of the compact between the States, and as to parties to the compact, there can't be any such claims, and I think that should be the end of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="5288.738" offset="21258324">Let's look at what the injury was to the farmers who were completely unrelated to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5292.814" offset="21274624">They clearly wouldn't -- they weren't parties to that litigation, and the Court said that's a perfectly legitimate way to figure out the right damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="5299.439" offset="21301164">So I think we would still have an argument that you -- that the Court would have the authority to grant that form of restitution under these circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="5334.031" offset="21439509">And, frankly, it's completely counterintuitive, because they have a monopoly.</text>

            <text syncTime="5374.766" offset="21602408">Washington and South Carolina said: We're not going to take every other -- every other State's waste, and we are getting out of this business.</text>
            <text syncTime="5383.497" offset="21637308">So the risk you would take in jumping out in the six months is that you then find out at the back end you have no place to dispose of your waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="5390.886" offset="21666879">So the reality is, they had -- all of the incentives to go forward existed as much in 1997 as they did in 1995, as they did in 1999.</text>
            <text syncTime="5400.943" offset="21707107">The only thing that's fundamental here is they had a responsibility not just to do what was appropriate; it was to do what was appropriate to get a license, and that's what they never did.</text>
            <text syncTime="5412.407" offset="21752978">They walked away.</text>
            <text syncTime="5413.639" offset="21757889">They took no action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5415.406" offset="21764995">Trying to negotiate funding in the abstract doesn't have anything to do with moving forward to get a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="5422.886" offset="21794879">On that score, the authority shut down and closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5426.200" offset="21808149">Justice Sotomayor, you asked: Is there any benefit that remains?</text>
            <text syncTime="5429.276" offset="21820479">Well, the reality is, geology studies and hydrology studies that get done, those things don't change for a billion years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5436.849" offset="21850781">So every one of those studies that was done is going to be just as valid today 12 years later, although I do think the right way to analyze this is not in terms of 12 years later, but what would have happened at the time.</text>
