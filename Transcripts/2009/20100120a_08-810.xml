            <text syncTime="5.735" offset="128355">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In this ERISA case, the court of appeals applied a deferential standard of review to the district court's interpretation of the Xerox plan, but not to the plan administrator's interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.080" offset="193766">We think the court of appeals got it backwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.365" offset="206932">Under either a deferential standard of review or a de novo standard, the plan administrator's interpretation should prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.054" offset="241622">That interpretation, unlike the district court's interpretation, is grounded in the language of the plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="81.535" offset="431585">It says: You did it incorrectly, and we find that what you should have done is this.</text>

            <text syncTime="1575.225" offset="6406311">First, I'd like to talk about why the lower courts in this case were not required to defer the legal principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.128" offset="6429926">And then in light of some of the factual claims he has made, which are belied by the record and directly contradict the findings of the lower court in this case, I'd like to explain why they didn't defer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.651" offset="6468065">Because sitting here, the irony to me is the core focus of his position is that courts have episodic involvement with these very complicated plans, and yet, as I'll get to in my second point, most of his position is predicated on things that are directly contrary to the court in this case that was on the ground that looked at these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.998" offset="6549462">He wants this Court, which has even less of an -- a typical and constant involvement with the plan, to second-guess the lower court, but--</text>

            <text syncTime="1656.463" offset="6731274">To me, that's the most difficult question in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.463" offset="6739320">I'm -- I'm glad we are going straight to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1665.485" offset="6767323">Here's what happened: Xerox made two arguments in the first round of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.271" offset="6786550">This is very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.306" offset="6790625">Their first argument was that a later plan applied retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.674" offset="6808074">They didn't want to apply the '89 plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.210" offset="6818210">Their second argument -- and this is -- here are the best places where you can find it: Page 42a of the petition appendix -- that's the Second Circuit; page 75a and 85a of the petition appendix -- this is where the district court said it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.351" offset="6870873">Their second argument was that section 9.6 of the 1989 plan permitted an appreciated offset, something more than just a nominal offset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.491" offset="6911415">This was rejected as arbitrary and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.877" offset="6924894">Now, the phantom account was rejected, but so was the broad principle that there could be an appreciated offset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.514" offset="6947464">Now, here's the answer to your question, Justice Alito: It would have been totally appropriate at that point in time for the Second Circuit to say there's going to be a nominal offset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.620" offset="6979856">We would have been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.670" offset="6984140">We wouldn't be here anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.703" offset="6988215">But Xerox essentially made a fairness argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.922" offset="7001067">They said: Well, this is a scrivener's error; we only left this out for 3 months -- which isn't true, by the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.909" offset="7021025">They left it out for 5 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.059" offset="7025622">But the court said: Well, if that's true and if this is going to be windfall, maybe Xerox has an equitable defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.081" offset="7053730">This is an (a)(1)(B) claim for -- under the terms of the plan, but they remanded this to the lower court out of consideration for Xerox, so that the lower court could look at equitable principles and say: Well, since the plan doesn't foreclose an appreciation, maybe under equity we should have some appreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.912" offset="7133038">And then what happened -- and this is the irony -- is Xerox went back -- and this right out of page 143a of the joint appendix -- they proposed an offset that effectively is an undisclosed $16 million appreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.570" offset="7187686">Here's why this is important: Their phantom account in the first round, it was an undisclosed $17 million appreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.306" offset="7214644">They didn't come in and say -- they made equitable arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.308" offset="7226661">If you look at their briefs, they said: We're -- we're not saying that this is what the plan means, but the plan has been invalidated; we're going to make equitable arguments of things that might be consistent with the plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="2284.875" offset="9244881">All of these points would be very important if we were designing a plan in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.493" offset="9263376">I'm not suggesting that the result in this case is what parties would bargain to in the first instance, if they had all the information.</text>

            <text syncTime="2302.087" offset="9313740">That's how we get to equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.687" offset="9320218">In fact, I think it would have been appropriate -- if I were litigating the case at that point, I would have argued you can't have an equitable defense, you need to enforce the nominal offset, but that ship has sailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.692" offset="9352192">So we go back on remand, and to -- to Mr. Long's point about how it's standard to have an actuarial offset -- take disclosure away for a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.464" offset="9387301">It's not standard to apply the -- the time value of money to the entire defined contribution balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.468" offset="9415304">I will not accept that characterization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.184" offset="9422200">Under the principle of duplication, we presented an alternative that used the time value of money offset, but it applied it to the relevant principle.</text>

            <text syncTime="2837.401" offset="11455049">That rule follows from trust law, and a contrary rule would undermine ERISA's protections for plan participants.</text>

            <text syncTime="3562.425" offset="14355163">Section 187 of his treatise, which correlates with section 187 of the Restatement Second, we think supports our approach that, unless there is bad faith or the trustee is acting outside the bounds of discretion -- and the court will get the trustee within the bounds of discretion, but unless there is some reason to think the trustee can't fairly and honestly exercise the discretion, the terms of the trust assign that responsibility to the trustee, and, therefore, the trustee should exercise that discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.979" offset="14485358">And then, finally, on this question of notice and whether there was adequate notice, not of the reconstructed account methodology, but of the plain vanilla annuity, the ordinary way this is done, we would urge the Court not to accept these representations that, oh, it's just the same question; if the notice for one is inadequate, the notice for the other must also be inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.979" offset="14589325">I mean, there's actually Second Circuit law, the McCarthy against Dun &amp; Bradstreet case, that holds that a summary plan description does not have to completely explain how you do every offset and actuarial adjustment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3646.862" offset="14692874">But the court of appeals held that this one was inadequate because it did not say that you were going to take into account the time value of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.951" offset="14725266">If that's the reason it held that this one was bad, the same reason would apply to the plain vanilla.</text>

            <text syncTime="3667.525" offset="14775526">I mean, I think, if it held that, I think that would be a mistake because there -- there are -- you know, it's just so typical that you have actuarial adjustments in pensions and in -- and in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.233" offset="14818367">I mean, people don't expect to take out a mortgage on a house for 20 years and pay no interest or buy a bond from the Treasury for 20 years and receive no interest.</text>
