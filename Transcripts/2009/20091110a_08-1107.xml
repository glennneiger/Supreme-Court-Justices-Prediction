            <text syncTime="8.487" offset="139327">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.189" offset="150194">The diversity statute deems a corporation a citizen of, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="14.641" offset="163986">"the State where it has its principal place of business. "</text>
            <text syncTime="17.291" offset="174540">closed quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.009" offset="177465">The Ninth Circuit erred in holding that Petitioner Hertz is a citizen of California, even though Hertz is headquartered in New Jersey and conducts over 80 percent of its operations outside the State of California, and even though, under the court's approach, national corporations could regularly be deemed California citizens if they conduct operations in that State that are proportional to the State's population.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.755" offset="260430">The better reading of the statute, in our view, is that it points to the location of the corporation's headquarters, the site from which a corporation directs and controls all the company's operations throughout all of its locations.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.111" offset="305883">And that is particularly the correct reading when the statutory language is considered in light of two considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.515" offset="327513">First, the strong preference for simplicity and ease of administration in jurisdictional rules; and second, Congress's purposes in 1958 to preserve diversity jurisdiction for corporations in 48 States and to deny access to diversity jurisdiction only in one State, the State where the corporation had its home or principal place of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.095" offset="405776">Now, with respect to the ordinary meaning of the statutory text, the critical phrase is "principal place of business".</text>
            <text syncTime="80.880" offset="428972">And dictionary definitions of that term define the term "principal place of business" as corporate headquarters, and that is fortified by Federal and State laws, which also define the term as "company's headquarters"--</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="92.807" offset="476620">Counsel, the problem with every test is that you can find an exception that makes the application ridiculous.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.162" offset="514027">Let's assume that we accept that headquarters or nerve center may have some applicability to a corporation that has a business in a variety of different States.</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="120.940" offset="589155">--because whether California has 20 percent and Florida 14 or 15 percent, to me the differences are not terribly substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.313" offset="630638">I can imagine McDonald's having 1 percent in every part of the world, and how do you choose then?</text>
            <text syncTime="137.950" offset="657178">California would say, then you -- you go back to headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.501" offset="679434">But I don't know why you start there.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.186" offset="686122">But let's posit the simpler situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.905" offset="701064">Headquarters in New Jersey, but everything else is in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.475" offset="723320">Your test would ignore completely that -- and it depends on how you define "headquarters".</text>
            <text syncTime="164.933" offset="765116">If they have three corporate executives, that's the entire extent -- or let's say one corporate executive who started the company and who lives in New Jersey, and he flies out to California half the time and runs the business from there but happens to live in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.561" offset="839617">Then you would say diversity is still New Jersey, correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="190.482" offset="867307">But let me -- let me start first with accepting Your Honor's premise, that in the situation of a multistate corporation with -- with diverse operations, the principal place of business would be the headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.190" offset="906177">Now, I take your point that there are situations in which the test may not seem so straightforward, but we think even in the -- the hypothetical that Your Honor posits, the better answer -- at least our first submission would be, the better answer is the headquarters would control.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.681" offset="960094">And that's for a couple of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.783" offset="964587">Although, again, the one exception that we would have to our rule is exactly Your Honor's hypothetical, and let me just bracket that.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.853" offset="988829">Now, the reason we think, first and foremost--</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="222.386" offset="994994">But you have not articulated a -- at least to me, a meaningful principle in which to set that exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.642" offset="1031983">It has to be tied somehow to the test and why the test in some situations would have applicability and others may not.</text>

            <text syncTime="243.400" offset="1079003">Because I don't know the difference between one headquarters and two places to do business or three, but I can still see that some factoring has to be done when the places of business are more limited.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="263.013" offset="1157475">But your case doesn't call for that judgment, because you have a multistate corporation, and it -- I assume you would be satisfied with saying that when a corporation has dispersed operations, it doesn't have its business center or its headquarters -- doesn't have its business center dominant in any one State, that it's dispersed, then you take the headquarters, because there's no way to pick among -- choose all the others, and it certainly isn't worth the labor to try to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.739" offset="1312329">So you could have a rule that says, dispersed across many States, you pick headquarters.</text>

            <text syncTime="313.113" offset="1357887">And we would certainly accept the resolution of the case in -- in that light.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.815" offset="1372724">If the Court were to announce a rule that says, multistate corporations with diverse operations, the principal place of business in that situation is the headquarters, I think Your Honor is correct that certainly we would prevail under that and that would be entirely acceptable to us.</text>

            <text syncTime="328.554" offset="1419640">Just because it wins your case and it solves your problem?</text>
            <text syncTime="332.473" offset="1435314">I mean, it seems to me, to do that, you abandon your principal argument, which that -- which is that "place" doesn't mean "State".</text>

            <text syncTime="394.776" offset="1684522">The first is that even if the operations are in one State and the headquarters are in a different State, the headquarters still is where the direction and control comes from.</text>

            <text syncTime="440.789" offset="1868528">Now, by and large, the headquarters is relatively straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.757" offset="1880440">It's made in public filings which are an easy place to look, and if you look at the experience of the Seventh Circuit, which of course has applied the headquarters approach across the board over the course of several decades, I think we can see that that test has been straightforward and it is simple in application, in the main.</text>

            <text syncTime="469.392" offset="1982945">And I would look also to what a corporation itself identifies as headquarters in public filings.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.628" offset="2003947">In 10-K filings and under the Model Business Corporations Act, corporations have to report their headquarters in annual reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.032" offset="2029547">And of course they are doing those reports for other reasons other than establishing jurisdiction in a particular case, so I think they come with an air of objectivity about them.</text>

            <text syncTime="489.472" offset="2063297">Now, I would make this other point, though, about the ambiguity that Your Honor points to with respect to the definition of a headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.626" offset="2087957">That -- that is not at all an ambiguity that only applies to our test, because under Respondent's test and under the test of every court of appeals, they take into account the headquarters.</text>

            <text syncTime="627.425" offset="2615108">Now, since then, the Collier's treatise, for example, would tell you that the majority and predominant rule is the headquarters rule, even in the bankruptcy context.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.013" offset="2641439">Pre-1958, I think there was a conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.531" offset="2651575">That's what the treatises said and that's what we explain in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.983" offset="2661397">But there certainly were some courts that adopted a headquarters approach, even in the bankruptcy context.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.869" offset="2676861">But I think one thing I would caution the Court about is assuming that just because some courts in the bankruptcy context, because of bankruptcy-specific considerations -- and a specific consideration was the felt need to have the assets of the bankrupt estate within the purview of the court so that the court could administer the estate -- that Congress would have wanted to import every judicial application down to every nuanced detail in the bankruptcy context over to the jurisdictional context, where we know that Congress thought that simplicity was a real virtue.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.419" offset="2787098">And I think, as Your Honor's opinion in Wachovia v. Schmidt a few terms ago points out, there is no reason to assume that Congress would have taken one word in the venue context and applied the exact same meaning to that same word in the jurisdictional context.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.410" offset="2835059">And here, because of the strong preference -- excuse me -- in favor of simplicity and administrability in jurisdictional rules, that is a particularly poignant reason why the headquarters approach, in our -- in our point of view, should govern in all circumstances.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sri Srinivasan</label>
            <text syncTime="718.000" offset="2977374">--Well, I think, if -- if what you are asking, Justice Ginsburg, is, where would the principal place of business be under the bankruptcy statute, the majority rule now, under the Fifth Circuit case Commonwealth Oil Refining and the Seventh Circuit case Peachtree, would show that the majority rule now is that the principal place of business would be New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.827" offset="3036724">And one point I would like to get to in that regard is the sort of oddity of saying that the -- the principal place of business of a company like Hertz would be somewhere other than New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.599" offset="3071833">The Ninth Circuit has a view that the principal place of business of Hertz is California, based on the fact that Hertz conducts 20 percent of its business in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.038" offset="3101612">But it is important to bear in mind that this statute is a zero-sum game.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.990" offset="3113420">So that if Hertz is deemed to have its principal place of business in California, such that it is disabled from getting access to diversity jurisdiction in California, the consequence is that Hertz would be enabled to gain diversity jurisdiction in every other State -- and I'm putting to one side Delaware, the State of incorporation -- but it would be enabled to gain access to -- to diversity jurisdiction in every other State.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.987" offset="3193354">So the consequence would be that if Hertz were sued in a State court action in Park Ridge, New Jersey, the site of its headquarters, Hertz could get Federal court jurisdiction in that jurisdiction on the theory that it's an out-of-State company, it's a California company, because it performs 20 percent of its business in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.746" offset="3256362">Now that -- the oddity of that, in our view, is particularly poignant if one takes into account a company like Wal-Mart.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.250" offset="3278409">Wal-Mart is universally recognized to be an Arkansas corporation because it is headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, but Wal-Mart also, it's undisputed, does substantially more business by any of the measures that the Ninth Circuit considers significant in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.458" offset="3331281">It has more employees there; it has more stores there; it generates more revenues there, by a significant factor well in excess of 50 percent over and above any other State.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.897" offset="3365031">But the consequence of deeming Wal-Mart a Texas corporation based on the amount of business it does in Texas would be not only that Wal-Mart would be disabled from getting Federal court jurisdiction in Texas, but that Wal-Mart would be enabled to get Federal court jurisdiction in Bentonville, Arkansas, on the theory that even in Arkansas, Wal-Mart would be an out-of-State corporation, a Texas corporation, because of the level of business that it conducts in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.096" offset="3453848">And we don't think that is the result that Congress would have envisioned in 1958 when it enacted the Principal Place of Business provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.433" offset="3479134">Instead, what Congress presumably had in mind is that corporations, as a general matter, are identified with the location of their headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.504" offset="3507451">So in the Wal-Mart situation, Wal-Mart rightly is universally acknowledged to be an Arkansas corporation because of the presence in that State of its headquarters.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sri Srinivasan</label>
            <text syncTime="1146.529" offset="4691529">It instead chose an approach whereby a company is disabled from getting diversity jurisdiction in one, and only one, jurisdiction, the jurisdiction in which it has its principal place of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.701" offset="4728205">And I think what Congress had in mind is that corporations, as a general matter, are identified with their headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.688" offset="4748163">And that is why Wal-Mart, for example, is universally recognized as an Arkansas company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.907" offset="4765090">It may be that Wal-Mart does substantial business in Texas, substantially in excess of other States, but Wal-Mart also does substantial business in a variety of jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.579" offset="4795705">But Congress decidedly didn't have the rule that says wherever Wal-Mart does a substantial business and is a well recognized company, it should be disabled from getting to Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.769" offset="4828515">It limited it to one jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.569" offset="4835725">And we think the best reading of the phrase "principal place of business" is the situs of the headquarters in that there were -- with -- with respect to the bankruptcy decisions, Your Honor, there -- there were bankruptcy courts that did have a "headquarters" approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.426" offset="4879088">And, in fact, the one bankruptcy court of which I am aware that looked at the meaning of the ordinary language -- we cite the -- the relevant -- the portion of the court's opinion at page 50 of our opening brief in footnote 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.650" offset="4924019">It is the First Circuit's opinion in the Burdick case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.417" offset="4931124">And what the First Circuit said was that a corporation's, quote, "principal office", rather than a factory, mill or mine, according to ordinary understanding and speech, constitutes the principal place of business within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.025" offset="4977518">And so even before 1958, I think there was definitely a sense out there that the term "principal place of business" does mean headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.612" offset="5003849">And this gets to Your Honor's other question which is: If Congress really meant "headquarters", why wouldn't they have used the term "headquarters" instead of "principal place of business"?</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.718" offset="5032270">And I think our answer to that, with respect to Your Honor, is that "principal place of business" is an alternative formulation for "headquarters".</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.371" offset="5058915">And so I don't think one can glean too much from the fact that Congress chose "principal place of business" rather than "headquarters" when "principal place of business" in our view is a reference to the headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.144" offset="5097994">And this Court's opinion last term in the Oswell Harlow versus United States case is a good example of that, because there the statute that was at issue used the term "facilitate" rather than the term "aid or abet".</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.185" offset="5138119">And one could have readily made the argument that because the statute uses the term "facilitate" rather than "aid or abet", that normal principles that accompany aiding and abetting liability shouldn't apply in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.308" offset="5178661">But the Court rightly in our view reached the contrary conclusion, and it was based on the notion that the term "facilitate", according to Black's Law Dictionary, means the very same thing as "aid or abet".</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.663" offset="5216068">And once you cross that bridge, then you can apply aiding or abetting principles to the term "facilitate".</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.717" offset="5236339">And here, likewise, the term "principal place of business", according to Black's Law Dictionary, means "headquarters".</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.371" offset="5258909">That's how Black's Law Dictionary defines the term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.756" offset="5268417">And so the fact that Congress chose one alternate formulation versus another, I don't think speaks too loudly to the question of--</text>

            <text syncTime="1305.416" offset="5327036">--Sure, and -- and, again, I would look at the public filings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.404" offset="5346994">In the public filings in the 10-K, for example, Hertz universally identifies its headquarters as Park Ridge, New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.307" offset="5370608">And the reason is that the chief executive officials are all located in Park Ridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.342" offset="5386804">Now, there is a large administrative apparatus in Oklahoma City, and, according to the affidavit, its administrative activities are performed in Oklahoma City to a lesser extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.881" offset="5428914">And that is at paragraph 11 of the affidavit, which is at pages 29a to 30a of the appendix to the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.852" offset="5452842">But I don't think there is any real dispute that Hertz's main headquarters are located in Park Ridge rather than Oklahoma City.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.689" offset="5476143">In point of fact, what you have in Oklahoma City -- and -- and this isn't spelled out in the -- in the affidavit, but what you have in Oklahoma City is essentially the rental call center and plus principal back-office duties like information technology support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.331" offset="5522745">But what you have in Park Ridge is all of the company's chief executives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.615" offset="5535911">So the decision making locus for the company's most important decisions is absolutely in Park Ridge, New Jersey, rather than Oklahoma City.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.452" offset="5563183">And there is no dispute on the point that is before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.888" offset="5576976">This Court comes -- this case comes to the Court on the assumption that Hertz's headquarters are located in Park Ridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.375" offset="5598919">The question for the Court is whether that headquarters location should be dispositive for purposes of defining a company's principal place of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.279" offset="5626504">Now, if I could -- if I could turn for one moment to the cost in terms of simplicity and demonstrability of an alternative formulation if the Court were to accommodate a formulation that didn't look to the headquarters, we see three potential categories of costs that are brought about by the -- the proposed approach of Respondents in what the Ninth Circuit has established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.442" offset="5707170">The first is the one that underlies the strong preference in favor of simple, demonstrable, jurisdictional rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.929" offset="5729113">And that is just the time and resources that would be invested at the threshold jurisdictional stage in defining whether the case is -- is before the proper court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1428.979" offset="5821377">Yes, that's our point, Justice Kennedy, and I think a "headquarters" test is simple and straightforward in that respect, and a "totality of circumstances" approach isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.783" offset="5848545">But there is also two additional costs that I would point out about a "totality of circumstances" approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.536" offset="5867562">One is that you can have the very real possibility because of the indeterminacy in that approach that different courts would reach divergent conclusions about the citizenship of the very same corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.058" offset="5905701">And as we point out on page 40 of our brief, that has already happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.410" offset="5919075">Two district courts in the Ninth Circuit alone in two California courts reached divergent conclusions on the citizenship of United Airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.600" offset="5947810">One court concluded that United was an Illinois citizen, and another court concluded that United was a California citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.837" offset="5972783">And that is not altogether surprising that you would have those sorts of divergent conclusions given the open-ended nature of the "totality of circumstances" approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.841" offset="6000786">The third cost that I would point to is the possibility that because of the indeterminacy in the approach you could have a situation in which a district court finds there is jurisdiction, proceeds to have a trial on the merits and renders -- renders judgment on the merits, and then several years later the court of appeals would reverse the judgment because the district court had gotten the jurisdictional input wrong at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.921" offset="6085110">And, again, that also, as with the situation with divergent conclusions on the citizenship of the same corporation, is not just a problem of theory.</text>

            <text syncTime="1634.742" offset="6644339">The first answer is that Congress was using a term of art that was imported from the Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.646" offset="6667954">In all of the Bankruptcy Code cases prior to 1958, the 11 USC 11 cases take an aggregation approach when they look at it State-by-State, so, if we raise principal place of business as a term of art that Congress imported into this statute, then we have to look at an aggregated State-by-State approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.392" offset="6751023">The other answer, I think, is more of a semantic answer, which is how did Congress define the word "place"?</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.646" offset="6775996">Certainly, the English language provides that a place can be a building, as Hertz would have, or a place could be a State, as we -- my place of birth, for example, is New York State.</text>
