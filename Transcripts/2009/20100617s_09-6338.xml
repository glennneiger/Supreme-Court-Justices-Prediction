            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="9.474" offset="144321">In 1993, petitioner Percy Dillon was convicted of among other things, crack cocaine offenses and was sentenced to 322 months imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.986" offset="190401">Roughly fifteen years later, the sentencing commission amended the Crack Cocaine Guidelines by lowering them and it made the amendments retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.221" offset="231361">Dillon then moved for sentence reduction under 18 USC code Section 3582 (C) (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="39.087" offset="262813">That provision authorizes a District Court to reduce an otherwise final sentence pursuant to a guideline amendment if a reduction is consistent with the commission's policy statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.926" offset="314117">The relevant policy statement found in section 1B1.10 of the Guidelines Manual precludes a court from reducing a sentence to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guidelines range except in circumstances not applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.036" offset="390604">Dillon nevertheless asked the district court to impose a sentence below the amended range, contending that our decision in United States versus Booker which made the guidelines advisory requires court to treat section 1B110 as nonbinding.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.485" offset="460403">He also asked the court to correct certain alleged errors in his original sentence that are unrelated to the guidelines amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.011" offset="494467">The District Court imposed a sentence at the bottom of the revised guideline range but declined to grant the further reduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.482" offset="528321">Finding Booker inapplicable to section 3582(C)(2), the court concluded that section 1B110 constrained it to impose a sentence within the amended range.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.849" offset="577849">The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.915" offset="590075">We granted certiorari to address Bookers' applicability to section 3582 (C) (2) proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.295" offset="619645">Dillon contends that proceedings under that section are essentially plenary re-sentencing proceedings and that Booker's holdings therefore apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.912" offset="666143">The text and purpose of the statute belay that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.125" offset="682966">Section 3582 (C) (2) represents a congressional act of lenity intended to give prisoners the benefit of later enacted guidelines amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.544" offset="724658">The authority of the courts acting under section 3582 (C) (2) is substantially constrained by the commission which is charged with determining whether and to what extent the guidelines amendment is retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.768" offset="777529">By statute, the court may exercise discretion to reduce a prisoner sentence only to the extent consistent with the commission's statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.148" offset="815041">In light of these unique constraints, it is clear that proceedings authorized under section 3582 (C) (2) are not re-sentencing proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.050" offset="858614">For the reasons elaborated in our opinion issued today we hold that treating section (1) (B) 110 as binding in these circumstances implicates neither the sixth amendment nor remedial interest that issue in Booker.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.614" offset="920889">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.548" offset="936667">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion, Justice Alito took no part in the decision of the court.</text>
