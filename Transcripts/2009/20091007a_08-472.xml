            <text syncTime="247.094" offset="1094865">I think it's quite clear, if you look at the statute, that the Section 1369, which is what the Respondents point to, would not prevent the VFW from taking down this memorial, if it so wanted to, because 1369 applies only to national memorials which are on public property.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.397" offset="1180024">If the transfer were to take place, of course, it would not be on public property, or it would not be under the supervision, in any way, of the Federal Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="378.320" offset="1619717">We do think that the issue before the Court now is the congressional legislation which has been passed, which is the transfer legislation, that that has essentially changed the situation on the ground, so that no longer is the question whether the display from the -- whether the display by the government would be constitutional, but only whether the government has the ability to transfer this property and -- and to give up all supervision, all control over it.</text>

            <text syncTime="410.230" offset="1747404">Look, procedurally this is a little boring, but it seems pretty well established in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.805" offset="1773631">I read a case called Toledo Scale and then there are a bunch of cases on jurisdiction, which I'm not going to name them because I'm sure you looked at them, but Travelers Indemnity, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.049" offset="1822636">And it seems to me they make absolutely clear that once a litigant, you and the others, have had an opportunity to raise a matter and now the case is over, done, but for an injunction that stays in, all those issues that they previously raised or could have raised are gone; that the only question left is whether the government has complied with the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.708" offset="1937262">So I read the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.627" offset="1944994">The injunction says the government is enjoined from permitting the display of the Latin cross, period.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.466" offset="1980312">Once this law takes effect and you follow it, you are violating that injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.026" offset="2006538">You don't need nine proceedings to see that.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.025" offset="2014584">You are violating it.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.808" offset="2021689">Now, if you don't like the injunction because you think the statute has so changed the circumstances there is no need for it, there is a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.998" offset="2058470">You go back to the district court and you say: Judge, change the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.898" offset="2082085">But you haven't done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.477" offset="2088354">And therefore, the only question before us is whether the Ninth Circuit is right in saying when you carry the statute into effect, you are violating this injunction, which I think no one could say you aren't.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.080" offset="2146764">Now, now, that -- that's a very technical boring issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.565" offset="2164736">I don't know why we heard this issue, but I don't see how we could reach any other issue in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1871.907" offset="7594026">I think, Justice Breyer, that you have it exactly correct, that what the government has done here by selecting a particular transferee who has been given preferential access to the land in the past to the exclusion of others who wanted to erect other symbols, that the government is taking affirmative steps to permit, through this transfer statute, the display of the cross that they are enjoined from doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.945" offset="7678245">Now, Justice Scalia, I believe your point is at some point if this is on private land and the government is not making any efforts to further this display, that it couldn't possibly be that the injunction forbids that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.250" offset="7723489">And that may well be correct, but that is not the case we have in front of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2914.452" offset="11764214">So, even though this may be an area that is not nearly as populated as Washington, D.C., it is very significant that Congress has taken the step with this particular symbol, one of only 49 in the country, grouping it with other iconic statues and memorials in this country and tied it.</text>
