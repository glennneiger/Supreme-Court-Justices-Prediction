            <text syncTime="1747.979" offset="7098326">The fact that partners are liable for actions of the partnership is a commonplace of partnership law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1781.469" offset="7232282">And all of those seven things are probably provided by the kinds of agencies you see advertised on television, which say: We will help you with your debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.992" offset="7270421">And they probably aren't lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.193" offset="7279198">And, so, if you look at the six of the seven things, it's clear that all of those are provided by those television companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.013" offset="7306470">And the seventh is simply added in, namely the providing legal representation, to be a catch-all to be sure that if one of those companies actually does something that is legal representation, even though they are not lawyers, they are caught, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.957" offset="7370313">So he is saying, read the whole paragraph and then you will see they are after the companies that appear on television and they're not after lawyers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1888.119" offset="7658914">But certainly neither the plain meaning nor the legislative record suggests that people who are not lawyers were actually engaging in conduct so brazen as to show up in Federal Bankruptcy Court, enter -- file a notice of appearance and purport to be a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.676" offset="7709174">That is not what this statute is intended to catch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.312" offset="7719727">At any rate, the legislative history I think amply supports our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.664" offset="7733102">Page 21 of our brief collects a number of citations to the legislative record specifically referring to attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.734" offset="7757343">As for the point Mr. Brunstad made about the change in the drafting history of this bill from 1999.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.340" offset="7799766">And in the House report accompanying the 1999 version of the bill, which had changed from "debt relief counseling agency" to "debt relief agency", the House report said,</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.712" offset="7837278">"It applies to attorneys, as well as to non-attorneys, such as petition preparers. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1939.467" offset="7864341">So I think that amply refutes the point about the drafting history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.003" offset="7878447">But in any event, if the Court were to look at legislative history, we think that the provisions of the 2005 House report accompanying the bill that actually was enacted are the most probative, and we've cited two references on page 21 of our brief that we think amply demonstrate that attorneys are included.</text>

            <text syncTime="3159.378" offset="12743910">There is no restriction on what content goes in the ad, only that it include this is disclaimer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.099" offset="12762823">Second, the term "debt relief agency" is a new one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.234" offset="12779332">It was coined by Congress in 2005 precisely because it includes -- it includes attorneys; it includes bankruptcy petition preparers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.256" offset="12807440">They had to -- you know, they had to come up with an amalgamated term that includes them both.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.108" offset="12822904">The fact that it's a new term -- it came freighted with no -- no preceding -- no baggage from its preceding history, and indeed, if the statute were on the books and allowed to take affect once this challenge is disposed of, I am confident that the meaning would become much more well-accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.320" offset="12887688">And the Petitioners have invited the Court, and this is on page 87 of their opening brief, to look at their website.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.657" offset="12913079">And of course that's outside the record, but to the extent that the Court looks at it, the Court will see that Petitioners refer to their bankruptcy practice as providing debt relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.895" offset="12942023">We think that's a natural way of -- of pitching what the services made available by a bankruptcy attorney are: Relief from one's debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.935" offset="12982147">So we don't think there is anything wrong with that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.720" offset="12993327">But I do want to turn back to why it's not correct to say that a debt relief agency would ever not -- not help people file for bankruptcy relief under the Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.326" offset="13031779">That is because, as I understand Petitioners' argument, it's that an assisted person might be a creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.961" offset="13050274">That is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.080" offset="13054767">The definition of "assisted person" turns on having nonexempt property in excess of a certain amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.384" offset="13079949">Under section 522(l) of the Bankruptcy Code, and indeed under this Court's decision in Owen v. Owen, there is no exempt property until there is a filing for bankruptcy and an assembly of the bankruptcy estate and a filing by the debtor, or someone on the debtor's behalf, filing schedules that specify what property the debtor has and which exemptions the debtor chooses to claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.230" offset="13167407">That is only done when there is a debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.999" offset="13178483">Creditors don't do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3443.670" offset="13881072">Justice Ginsburg, your example about the woman who is in need of medical attention falls squarely within the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.323" offset="13903747">The lawyer would be prohibited from advising her to incur debt to get needed medical attention, and the government, in trying to articulate a way around that during the course of the argument, articulated no less than five different standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.566" offset="13960694">The conduct would have to be fraudulent or unethical or abusive or criminal or improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.952" offset="13978248">None of those are in the statute, and it's impossible to know which one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.154" offset="13991100">Chief Justice Roberts, you are absolutely right: What this statute does is it's basically trying to interfere with the attorney-client relationship, and even moreso on the side of "or pay an attorney".</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.480" offset="14040315">And Justice Breyer, here's how it works.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.430" offset="14048152">The client comes to -- the prospective client comes to the lawyer and is in trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.050" offset="14066646">And may not know whether the client has to file for bankruptcy or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.418" offset="14080125">So there is a conversation that happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.184" offset="14087231">And in that conversation, it may be decided that the best thing for the client to do is to file for bankruptcy, and of course, the client will have to know: How am I going to pay for this?</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.440" offset="14120249">Well, there are two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.356" offset="14123907">One, the client can pay the attorney in full, up front, or the attorney can take payment over time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.360" offset="14147835">However, this all happens before bankruptcy, so there is no involvement of the Court at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.811" offset="14165703">If the attorney accepts payment over time, which many do, because it's very expensive to file for bankruptcy now and most debtors don't have the wherewithal, the attorney, by saying, I take payment over time, and the debtor accepting that, the debtor would be incurring debt in contemplation of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.071" offset="14222754">Incurring debt to the attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.857" offset="14229859">The attorney would be proscribed, under the statute, from actually giving that particular advice.</text>
