            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">Justice Breyer has the Opinion of the Court in two cases this Morning.</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="4.532" offset="123549">The first is Dolan versus United States as to do with the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act, which says “notwithstanding any other provision of law, when sentencing a defendant convicted of certain crimes”.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.265" offset="194497">The Court shall order that the defendant make restitution to the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.895" offset="216963">Now later provision of the act says “if the victim's losses are not ascertainable by the date, that is ten days prior to sentencing, the Court shall set a date for the final determination of the victim's losses, not to exceed 90 days after sentencing”.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.093" offset="301808">In this case, the sentencing Judge made clear in his initial judgment that he would order restitution but he couldn't determine or didn't determine the precise amount of the victims loss until more than those 90 days of past, indeed three months had passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.526" offset="367532">The question before us is whether the sentencing Court have the power to ascertain the victims loss at that later time.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.679" offset="404104">We conclude that the judge did possess that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.624" offset="423957">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="81.015" offset="429495">Well this Court has sometimes read a statutory provision with a deadline like this as creating a legally enforceable time directive but as not requiring the judge to forfeit the power to act, if the time deadline is missed.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.418" offset="503056">We have held for example that the judge who misses a statutory time deadline for holding a bail hearing, can still hold that hearing and deny bail even at a later date.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.295" offset="554569">We here hold that the deadline before us is that kind of a deadline.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.458" offset="575258">Missing the deadline does not deprive the sentencing judge of the power to order restitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.859" offset="600858">One important factor that convinces us is that immediately following the words not to exceed 90 days after sentencing, the statute specifies that a victim, who subsequently discovers further losses, can still seek restitution, no matter when he discovers those losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.358" offset="678808">It would be an anomalous for a single provision to grant a right to recover restitution to a victim who does not discover the harm until say one year or five years or 20 years has passed, but deny that same right to a victim who cannot ascertain the precise amount of his harm for more than 90 days and it would be particularly anomalous to read this statute that way since the basic aim of this statute is to secure mandatory restitution, to crime victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.305" offset="826661">We discuss these reasons and others at greater length in our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.948" offset="845260">The defendant here did not try to show that the delay prejudice came in anyway and we consequently do not consider how such prejudice could be taken into account, nor do we consider the complicated question of when a defendant can or must appeal a matter that affects not only restitution but also other kinds of sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.989" offset="929374">We leave all such matters to another day.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.553" offset="943585">Chief Justice Roberts has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Stevens, Scalia and Kennedy have joined.</text>
