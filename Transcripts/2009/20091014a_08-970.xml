            <text syncTime="10.872" offset="149964">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Plaintiff's counsel in this case earned a large fee award based on prevailing market hourly rates and a substantial number of hours expended.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.180" offset="195208">However, the district court determined that the $6 million lodestar was insufficient to compensate them for the quality of their representation or their results obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.904" offset="242019">This Court has previously held that factors, such as novelty and complexity of the issues, contingency, and superior performance cannot be used to increase the lodestar amount because the factors are subsumed within that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.849" offset="309833">But because of this Court's indication that, in rare or exceptional circumstances, upward adjustments may be permissible, district courts, such as the one below, have used quality and results to increase lodestar awards, even though the -- the multiplication of the reasonable number of hours expended times the reasonable hourly rate constitutes a fully compensatory fee and serves the purpose of the statute, which is to attract competent counsel without providing a windfall.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.904" offset="442013">Now, with respect to quality of representation, that normally involves two factors: the skill and experience of the attorney, and also the effort it takes to succeed in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.712" offset="489242">In this case, the lead counsel submitted affidavits indicating that they sought hourly rates that were within the prevailing market rates in the Atlanta market; and, in fact, lead counsel's market rate, the court found, was at the upper end of that market.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="306.559" offset="1332684">Mr. Cohen, you said in your brief that, in such a case, the prevailing party could argue that counsel should obtain a higher hourly rate in the litigation than the customary rate he or she charges in other cases, and that's the situation Justice Sotomayor inquired about.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.279" offset="1447518">But that sounds to me -- you take the second-year associate, pay him at the rate of the top partner because her performance was so outstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.300" offset="1487642">That's an enhancement, but it isn't as transparent as the one that Judge Shoob gave.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.406" offset="1528080">But you -- this suggestion -- maybe you are going to retreat from it -- that it would be appropriate to take the second-year associate and pay at a higher hourly rate than the customary rate for that associate.</text>

            <text syncTime="393.615" offset="1680948">He didn't perform like a second-year associate.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.702" offset="1697249">He performed like a 15-year lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.971" offset="1714280">The difference is not with respect to skill and experience.</text>

            <text syncTime="409.410" offset="1744060">And so what Justice Ginsburg was asking is, what you are basically saying, the quality of that representation, even though it reflected more than the market one would look at objectively on the basis of the years of experience, that judge can't enhance, even though someone performed far above whatever else the market would consider his or her skills at the moment.</text>

            <text syncTime="457.974" offset="1938307">Well, if you are -- if you are going to basically treat that second-year associate as a 15-year partner and award him a $500-an-hour rate, what you are actually doing is overcompensating that person for what the expenditure of time was and for what the actual fee they would have charged to their client was.</text>

            <text syncTime="1559.556" offset="6344641">I think Respondents' own trial counsel -- the discussion that they give of the lodestar rates used in this case I think is particularly telling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.578" offset="6384765">And this is the affidavit of Marcia Lowry, who was the lead plaintiff's trial counsel, and this was submitted during the fee -- setting hearing, and the relevant excerpt appears on page 41 of the Joint Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.635" offset="6432935">And I want to read from paragraph 25, and here's what she has to say about the rates used by the court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.556" offset="6460625">"The standard hourly rates reflected in Exhibit 2. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1608.453" offset="6540246">Now, the affidavit goes on to say that the rates are still too low for the other factors that Mr. Cohen discussed -- contingency risk, delayed payment, expert fees -- but not for attorney performance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1626.014" offset="6610463">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Let me begin with the colloquy that involved Justices Ginsburg and Justice Kennedy about the rates and whether you can have sort of pre-enhanced rates as part of the lodestar or whether you can only do the enhancement after the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.293" offset="6675665">At the end of the day, as long as it is established in this case that you can have an enhancement for quality, I suppose that my -- my clients would be satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.482" offset="6712341">The point is, though, that the preexisting law in the Eleventh Circuit and most circuits does not allow for a pre-enhanced rate to be used to calculate the lodestar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.587" offset="6752778">They are either done completely mechanically, as Justice Ginsburg suggests -- the Laffey index in the D.C. Circuit -- or they are done through a simple calculation of the prevailing market rates.</text>

            <text syncTime="1672.062" offset="6794679">But sometimes there's a great advantage in doing things mechanically, because it -- it provides an element of fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.316" offset="6819756">And I'll tell you what troubles me about this, and maybe you can convince me that I shouldn't be troubled by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.637" offset="6845043">Here the district judge in effect takes four plus million dollars from the taxpayers of Georgia and -- and awards it above the lodestar calculation to these attorneys and says -- and I -- I certainly take him at his word -- this was the best performance I have seen in 28 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.616" offset="6928948">But it seems totally standardless, and I see no way of policing it, and I see a great danger that trial judges are going to use this as a way of favoring their favorite nonprofit foundation or their favorite cause or their favorite attorneys, because they think they generally do good work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.101" offset="7030826">And this is not -- this is not like private litigation where the money is coming out of the pocket of a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.837" offset="7057784">It's coming out of the pocket of taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.373" offset="7067920">So that is very troubling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.223" offset="7075338">And I don't know how you can provide standards for determining whether this kind of transfer is based on anything reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1762.636" offset="7156945">And this Court has already held in Farrar v. Hobby that the results obtained is an adequate basis for departure, and not a small departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.558" offset="7188710">In Farrar v. Hobby, the lodestar amount, the mechanical calculation that we're talking about, was $280,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="2243.763" offset="9081543">Well, Justice Breyer, let me take issue, though, with the hypothetical that all these lawyers are getting the top, top rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.382" offset="9099933">That's not -- that's not what is happening, either in this case or in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.286" offset="9119577">And one of the things, if you look out at the circuits, you will see that, because this Court has always said that the lodestar method is a two-step process, the first step, as this Court has repeatedly described it, is an estimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.344" offset="9171822">Because of that, the circuits have some looseness as to how they go about estimating the reasonable hourly rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.450" offset="9200243">They do not say: Let's take the tippy-tip-top rate and use that to calculate the rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.604" offset="9220827">They use a variety of formulas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.639" offset="9232948">As I say, the Laffey index in the D.C. Circuit is quite formulistic and doesn't -- it puts you in three-year groups and doesn't change your compensation between your 8th and 11th year and your 12th and 20th year, so it's very mechanical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.379" offset="9287910">In some circuits, you can get a national rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.231" offset="9299404">So in a circuit -- if this case would have been litigated in Cincinnati in the Sixth Circuit, then Ms. Lowry may have been able to get $700 an hour, which is a national rate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3004.021" offset="12122509">I mean, this Court has said that there are bases for downward departures, and including downward departures all the way to zero in Farrar v. Hobby, and the Court has not been overly concerned about cabining that discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3019.863" offset="12185934">It can take place in the terms of looking at a particular motion and saying that wasn't a very good motion; you were wasting your time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.617" offset="12208922">There are a variety of ways that that can be taken into account downward, and this Court hasn't felt that concerned about cabining the discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.707" offset="12237239">Now, if this Court wants to cabin the discretion, I think certainly there's two factors here: There's the quality of service and there is the exceptional results.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.127" offset="12270989">As to the quality of service, I would certainly say that you ought not to have a rigid rule, which is essentially what Petitioners are asking for, that would cap you with prevailing market rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.019" offset="12314561">There ought to be some flexibility for that, for the judge to take into account the actual experience that the judge has with the lawyers in the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.607" offset="12344863">The second thing I would say is that I do think it ought to be fair, if you are going to do this kind of calculation, that you don't base it on something like the Laffey index, and you don't base it on a rule that a national expert can never get a national prevailing rate, but even though they are sitting in New York, they have to get the top rate only in the Atlanta market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.085" offset="12422813">I think those differences should be taken into account on the compensation side of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.556" offset="12440680">And then if at some point, the judge wants to say, and I want to give either this rate or this multiplier for the quality of the performance, then that's something that you can certainly assess.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.829" offset="12477774">As to the exceptional results, I also think there, too, you can focus on specific factors of the case before you, and you can say things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.649" offset="12509017">Now, I would say, for example in this case, part of the reason the results are exceptional -- I would point to at least three things: One is the advance of capital here in order to take on a case of this breadth and undertaking is really an exceptional undertaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.658" offset="12565128">And if you look at the Goldberg declaration at Joint Appendix 75, that declaration points out that a smaller firm would have essentially been bankrupted by this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3143.891" offset="12682052">It's worth pointing out that one factor that Judge Shoob took into account in giving an enhancement here was the delay in payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.181" offset="12711205">That is a permissible factor under Missouri v. Jenkins, and even if you use current rates, that doesn't do anything to compensate you for the delay in reimbursement of expenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="3160.470" offset="12748298">I think rates are set with -- based on a law firm's record of -- I mean, just because you bill a client doesn't mean that they are going to pay or that they are going to pay at what you billed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.543" offset="12780586">And I think the rates are set to take into account that over the past year whatever you have a realization rate of -- whatever, 80 percent or 85 percent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3176.914" offset="12814127">Oh, I was just making a narrow point, Mr. Chief Justice, which is the current rates don't take into account the fact that there was a delay in repayment for reimbursable expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.235" offset="12847355">Some of these expenses were paid out 4 years ago, I mean at the time of the fee calculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.056" offset="12866685">You don't get sort of, you know, today's copying expenses or today's FedEx expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.591" offset="12884762">You get the expenses at the time you did them, and you don't get any prejudgment interest on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.328" offset="12903779">So that is one thing Judge Shoob thought ought to be compensated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.614" offset="12916945">Again, that's one factor that makes this exceptional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.066" offset="12930738">Another factor is that this was an entrenched problem that they were dealing with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.701" offset="12945262">In 1989 the foster care child system in Georgia was described as a crisis; by 1996 it had been upgraded to a catastrophe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.623" offset="12976922">This is a very difficult problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.956" offset="12982251">The last thing is the scope of the relief, which really is, I think, very broad here and that's what Judge Shoob was recognizing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.395" offset="13012031">And as I said earlier, I do think in an era of coupon settlements, a judge is entitled to look at a case like this and say this is really a remarkable result that has been achieved here, and the normal rates -- normal prevailing market rates don't compensate for this kind of result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.755" offset="13073471">So I do think there are things that the Court could point to in this case or in other cases to try to cabin that discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.559" offset="13096667">I do think, though, that discretion is an inherent feature of this statutory regime, and this Court has tolerated a degree of discretion in a variety of contexts including with respect in the area of downward departures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.033" offset="13146614">I do want to get, before I sit down, this point about getting the incentives right, because one thing that Congress was clearly very concerned about was getting the incentive rights for counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.656" offset="13185066">And if you accept Petitioner's position that the lodestar is a ceiling and not something that is subject to adjustment up or down, then what you are telling lawyers is the that the maximum amount they can make in a civil rights case is the minimum amount they can make in a different case, where by the way they will get paid every 30 days and their expenses will get reimbursed in real time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.470" offset="13264374">Then you are also telling them something else, which is, that's actually just a starter because there are multiple ways for district courts to cut down on the lodestar amount, either because you spent too much time on this or we didn't like your travel expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.027" offset="13314529">And so there are multiple ways for those hours to be cut down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.829" offset="13325709">If you accept Petitioner's rule and there is no way to get those rates bumped up in any circumstances, then you are basically guaranteeing that, as I say, the maximum you can make in a civil rights is the minimum you can make in any other kind of cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3339.335" offset="13463740">--Two things, Mr. Chief Justice: One, it's the law of the Eleventh Circuit and I think every circuit that before submitting your fees to the court you are supposed to use billing judgment and take care of some of those things, approximating maybe what your client would do for you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.126" offset="13514940">But, second, and I think more tellingly, the client may do that to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.447" offset="13528210">The client doesn't have the help of your opposing counsel to egg them on and give them suggestions, and that's what a district court does in the context of one of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.803" offset="13565618">So I really think, as a practical matter, you are systematically undercompensating counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.755" offset="13585471">And I mean, if you want to take into account practicalities, I am not here to reargue the Dague case, but if you want to talk about practicalities, the fact that all of these cases are contingency cases and the rational market for those would be much higher than -- if you are worried about sort of windfalls for plaintiff counsel in these kind of cases, you really can worry about something else, with all due respect, because the combined effect of Dague and Casey makes it very difficult to get sort of comparable compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.239" offset="13691423">As I say, I am not here to reargue those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.857" offset="13701872">I do think, frankly, Dague is distinguishable because there you had the prevailing party language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.595" offset="13720785">The other thing about Dague that's distinguishable that I will say before I sit down is one of this Court's concerns in Dague was creating an asymmetry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.082" offset="13746803">Blanchard had already said that contingency fees could not cap your awards; they didn't want to have an asymmetrical system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.502" offset="13772403">That's exactly what Petitioners are asking you for, is a completely asymmetrical system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.472" offset="13788285">Farrar v. Hobby says you can reduce downwards based on exceptionally poor results.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.508" offset="13808452">There would be no basis whatsoever to even adjust a little bit under their rule for exceptional results on the upside.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark H. Cohen</label>
            <text syncTime="3434.864" offset="13845859">Than you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.649" offset="13848994">I would like to start out with the little joke that Mr. Clement made, is that you get what you pay for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.553" offset="13872609">You do get what you pay for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.536" offset="13880550">Is because I am getting paid half my hourly rate in this case means I exert half of what I would do for another client who would pay my full rate?</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.509" offset="13916494">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.194" offset="13919211">Because my professional responsibility is that when I'm hired by a client for an hourly rate, I'm supposed to represent that client zealously within the bounds of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.049" offset="13958604">So to say that in a case like this that these lawyers would have done a different type of job had they not known there was a possibility of a quality enhancement is an insult, frankly, to Ms. Lowry and her group, because they do this all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.826" offset="14021716">They do it without getting an enhancement; they never asked for one before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.880" offset="14038016">And, clearly, if this Court determines that a quality enhancement is going to be available even in rare or exceptional circumstances, you are going to have arbitrary results and you are going to have inconsistency which the analytical part of the lodestar guards against.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.008" offset="14106457">Second point I would make is that Mr. Clement mentioned about the New York rates and the overhead.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.662" offset="14137072">That was not the rationale for the district court's awarding a quality -- or an enhancement here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.066" offset="14158702">That was not part of it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.018" offset="14166538">Getting back to what the court has mentioned:</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.886" offset="14178032">"The best lawyer I have ever seen. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.520" offset="14188481">Look at what the purpose of this fee-shifting statute is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.624" offset="14200916">It's to attract competent counsel by awarding them a reasonable fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.326" offset="14215753">What attorney is going -- who wouldn't normally take a civil rights case is going to say: Maybe I will take it, because maybe the judge will say I'm the best he's ever seen or one of the best I've ever seen?</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.233" offset="14263400">It's not a rational reason to give out there to attract competent counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.453" offset="14284298">Counsel are going to take a civil rights case because they know if they prevail they are going to get their prevailing market rate, they are going to get all their hours, their reasonable number of hours put in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.493" offset="14328393">In this case, it was 25,000 hours over a 3-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.463" offset="14344276">And they got their reasonable rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.182" offset="14359218">The judge also double-counted for quality because Ms. Lowry got a $495 rate in part because of her, quote, "stellar performance", as the district judge decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.140" offset="14411045">So to count that again by giving an enhancement is impermissible double-counting, as this Court has held in previous cases, including Delaware Valley.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.328" offset="14447720">Finally, I would say that the district judge's order in this case, if left undisturbed, will create additional applications for enhancements and whether they are granted or not, as Justice O'Connor pointed out in the Delaware Valley II case in her concurrence, it's not the issue of the rarity of the granting of the enhancement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.528" offset="14536537">The issue is the requesting of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.146" offset="14546986">And the requests are going to come out the wazoo, and district courts are going to be deciding things arbitrarily and on different bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.335" offset="14583766">And for those reasons, we would respectfully urge this Court to reverse.</text>
