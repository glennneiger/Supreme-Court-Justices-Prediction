            <text syncTime="24.448" offset="202146">Yet the Florida Supreme Court erred in two ways to suppress a voluntary confession relied upon for Kevin Powell's conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.369" offset="233911">First, the Florida court misapplied the analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.689" offset="255122">Rather than evaluating the warning under a reasonably conveyed standard for the right to an attorney, the court strictly parsed the warning, seeking certain words in a certain order.</text>

            <text syncTime="56.420" offset="330041">The court overemphasized the order in which the rights were given, and furthermore, the court applied a hypertechnical analysis of the warning's language.</text>

            <text syncTime="691.385" offset="2869979">Because the FBI advice of rights says:</text>

            <text syncTime="3525.265" offset="14205450">Mr. Chief Justice, let me make three brief points, after responding to a question that Justice Stevens asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.835" offset="14227707">In terms of independent and adequate State grounds, in our brief, we relied on the Florida court citing Miranda, the case, not Miranda, as the phraseology, that the Florida Supreme Court interwove the Federal law based on Miranda, the case itself, and there is no plain statement to the otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.648" offset="14302939">Three quick points: There is no manipulation behind this warning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.350" offset="14317777">This warning is the result of litigation in Thompson v. State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.969" offset="14332301">That was a 1991 decision by the Florida Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.688" offset="14347139">The -- the Tampa police had changed its warning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.408" offset="14361976">The previous warning had 148 words.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.694" offset="14371171">This warning is simpler, with 79 words.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.460" offset="14382247">The previous warning had arcane and redundant language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.598" offset="14394786">This language is more straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.964" offset="14404295">Those are the reasons behind the change in the warning, not any kind of inference, as amici makes, towards manipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.536" offset="14430521">Second, what Respondent is asking for is exactly what this Court chose not to do in Prysock.</text>
