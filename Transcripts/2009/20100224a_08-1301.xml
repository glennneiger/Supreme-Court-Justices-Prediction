            <text syncTime="8.197" offset="138177">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Congress uses ordinary words in the statute, those words should get their ordinary meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.321" offset="166703">In SORNA, the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, Congress did use ordinary words, and it used them in an ordinary way.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.786" offset="192616">But the government proposes that those words be given a most extraordinary reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.376" offset="210902">It suggests that Congress wrote one of the elements of SORNA's criminal offense in a sort of shorthand, and it should be taken to mean something quite different than what Congress actually said.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.510" offset="243503">It proposes--</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="35.232" offset="246324">Mr. Rothfeld, I wondered if I could ask you about three interrelated points concerning your textual argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.400" offset="283000">And if I could just lay those on the table and get your reaction to them, I would appreciate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.380" offset="302958">The first is that it appears that there is a pretty universally accepted modern legislative drafting convention that statutes should be phrased in the present tense.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.094" offset="349769">The Senate drafting manual, for example, says: Always use the present tense unless the provision addresses only the past, the future, or a sequence of events that requires use of a different tense.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.356" offset="394804">And the House manual is to the same effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.495" offset="407448">The second is that when the section that's involved here, 2250, was drafted, the drafters didn't know whether SORNA would apply to pre-SORNA sex offense convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.676" offset="476097">That was left up to the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.708" offset="484248">And so when they were drafting this, they had -- it was natural, perhaps, for them not to make a special provision for the possibility that there might be some pre-SORNA conduct involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.105" offset="541821">If the Attorney General had determined that only post-SORNA convictions would qualify, then only -- then the only travel that would qualify would be -- would be post-SORNA travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.630" offset="599918">It was only when the Attorney General decided that pre-SORNA convictions could qualify that the question that's presented here became a possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.362" offset="634817">And the third is that once the Attorney General decided that SORNA would apply to pre-SORNA sex offense convictions, that necessarily meant that conduct constituting a -- a SORNA -- constituting a qualifying sex offense could occur in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.825" offset="720708">And yet there are at least four provisions of SORNA that refer to the conduct that constitutes a sex offense and uses only the present tense, although in those instances it seems that those provisions have to be read as also covering past conduct, pre-SORNA conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.922" offset="813077">These are all in 42 U.S.C. 16911, which is reproduced -- the relevant provisions are on 3a to 3-6 of the government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.948" offset="861247">I'll just mention a couple of them to provide a flavor for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.179" offset="878174">Under 42 U.S.C. section 16911(3)(C), on 3a of the government's brief, an offense may qualify as a tier II offense if, among other things, it, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="205.471" offset="927284">"occurs after the offender becomes a tier I sex offender. "</text>
            <text syncTime="210.984" offset="949332">But there "occurs" and "becomes" have to be read as applying to past conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.342" offset="970752">42 U.S.C. 1691(4) on the same page says that an offense may qualify as a tier III offense if, among other things, it involves a kidnapping of a minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.368" offset="1026863">But "involves" there has to mean also "involved".</text>
            <text syncTime="233.663" offset="1040029">And the other two are subsection (7) on 5a and subsection (8) on 6a.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.861" offset="1060822">So I wondered if you could comment on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.094" offset="1073779">Maybe you have a reaction to it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_a_rothfeld" startTime="245.487" stopTime="363.560">
            <label>Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="245.487" offset="1087363">--Well, I'll try to keep straight each of the parts of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.327" offset="1106693">A couple of reactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.843" offset="1112754">First of all, I think that the ordinary assumption is that when the present tense is used in a statute that's creating a criminal offense, it refers to conduct that takes place after the statute was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.132" offset="1157998">We are not aware of and the government has not cited any decision of this Court in which it has interpreted a present tense verb used in a criminal statute as attaching criminal consequences to conduct that took place before the Act -- before the statute was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.768" offset="1212541">But before delving too deeply into the present tense question, I think it's helpful to take a look at how that fits into the other elements of the SORNA criminal offense, because there are a number of things about the statutory language that we think compel the conclusion that Congress had in mind only the attachment of criminal consequences to travel that took place after SORNA was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.696" offset="1296238">For example, and to begin with, the first element of the offense, which provides that the defendant is required to register under SORNA, the government says, and we agree, that the elements of the SORNA offense have to be read sequentially so that the defendant is guilty only if he or she commits them in order.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.655" offset="1384009">The first element, as I said, the statutory text, is SORNA.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.182" offset="1402190">And it seems undeniable that a defendant is not and cannot possibly be required to register under SORNA until SORNA is enacted and is on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.368" offset="1442941">And that is enough to dispose of this case because, as the government agrees, the elements are sequential.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.192" offset="1470213">The first element is that there is a requirement to register under SORNA.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.348" offset="1486827">The second element, the travel in interstate commerce, has to follow the first element.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.252" offset="1502396">The travel, therefore, must follow the enactment of SORNA.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.144" offset="1510024">That we think is sufficient to dispose of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.408" offset="1523085">The government's answer to that point is to say -- really, to candidly acknowledge that the statutory language has to be rewritten if they're to prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.793" offset="1552551">They say when Congress said "is required"--</text>

            <text syncTime="1564.792" offset="6364620">As Justice Ginsburg elucidated, he does not dispute that the first paragraph of SORNA can be triggered by a pre-SORNA conviction, and adopting his construction of paragraph (2)(B) would create a serious structural anomaly between the Federal offenders, with whom there is no requirement that they engage in any post-SORNA conduct other than the failure to register, and the State sex offenders, who are the majority of the missing sex offenders that Congress intended to capture by enacting the new registration regime and ensuring that there would be a serious Federal penalty that would encourage offenders who had used interstate travel to evade their registration requirements to get back on the registration rolls.</text>

            <text syncTime="1627.578" offset="6615709">This is a problem that would occur with all sorts of Federal criminal statutes based on a status that somebody was in at the time something was made criminal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1659.098" offset="6741828">That's the reasoning that the Court used in Tranbarger and in Samuels; somebody who acquired alcohol legally before a statutory prohibition provision came into effect would be given a reasonable period of time to divest himself of possession.</text>

            <text syncTime="2686.964" offset="10853292">We think that the sequencing requirement makes sense on both ends, that somebody needs to have the sex offense conviction before they travel, and then they need to fail to register after they have -- they have engaged in the travel, because that's the concern that Congress was trying to get at, persons who were able to use the fact of interstate travel to evade registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.130" offset="10929988">And the reason, Mr. Chief Justice, why I think that Congress didn't include a purpose requirement there is because Congress didn't want sex offenders to be able to take advantage of the fact that they had another good reason to travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.675" offset="10972097">If my employer transfers me from one State to another, and then I take advantage of that situation to go underground and not re-register, that's one of the 100,000 missing sex offenders that Congress was concerned about, even though I would have had a good defense to the charge that I had traveled with the purpose or for the purpose of evading sex offender registration requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.929" offset="11061123">Justice Sotomayor, I think you were asking a question about -- about why the -- what the purpose would be served here if States would already have the underlying offense that would be made criminal by SORNA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.406" offset="11151088">I think that there are a couple different answers to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.872" offset="11156940">Mr. Rothfeld acknowledged that Congress may well have intended there to be extra force that would come from the -- from the Federal prosecution itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.463" offset="11187242">But separately I think it's important to note that -- that States were given time to comply with SORNA, to come into substantial compliance with SORNA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.318" offset="11218693">And -- and even though no State at this point has said that they don't intend to come into compliance with SORNA, Congress couldn't necessarily have expected States to adopt the particular offense that they -- that they were concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.953" offset="11269266">And I think that -- that -- that here Congress did want to -- to cover that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.529" offset="11291523">One other factual point that's associated with the -- the effectiveness there that was brought up in the briefs and hasn't come up today is the question of -- of when the prior Wetterling Act offenses were repealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.320" offset="11346693">And I -- I -- in section 129 of SORNA, the Wetterling Act offense was repealed effective 3 years after the date of SORNA's effective date, even without regard to the 1-year extensions issued by the Attorney General, notwithstanding a point in the Petitioner's reply brief, simply because section 129 doesn't incorporate 124(B), which has the extension provision for the Attorney General.</text>

            <text syncTime="2911.498" offset="11751382">And, so, in -- in -- in these cases, even if the State hasn't changed the name on the door to SORNA registration facility -- it's just sex offender registration facility under, you know, Zachary's Law, which is the name of the Indiana sex offender registration law, as opposed to Megan's Law -- there is -- they are still required by SORNA to register, which requires them to give information to the relevant officials in the relevant jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.942" offset="11853155">And the jurisdiction is there; the officials are there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.052" offset="11861619">They are taking the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.378" offset="11866948">As long as the officials will take the information, the failure to do that is a violation of 2250.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.327" offset="11894742">And there's one -- one other point that Petitioner was making in the reply brief was that there seemed to be some confusion about -- about whether there was an offense under SORNA when States had not yet come into compliance or whether that would have been an offense only under the pre-SORNA Wetterling Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.682" offset="11960153">And -- and the reason that there isn't a SORNA violation there, if -- if a State has not yet decided to accept things like digital palm prints or whatever the extra information is that SORNA would require, the -- the defendant is still required to provide that, what information the State will accept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.937" offset="12045208">And the affirmative defense in 2250(b) would only be applicable in circumstances where the State wouldn't take that extra information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.732" offset="12076345">So it's only those aspects of SORNA that are above and beyond what the State will allow the offender to do, that he's excused from complying with by the affirmative defense, that it's uncontrollable circumstances that he -- that he can't provide a DNA sample or a palm print in a particular State that doesn't do that yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.926" offset="12153145">But as long as the State is taking the rest of the information, he needs to give that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.614" offset="12167879">And this is a case where Petitioner utterly failed to give any of the information to Indiana once he arrived there at the end of 2004 or beginning of 2005.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.500" offset="12207376">So, there's -- there's no dispute that the State would have taken that information had he been in compliance with that law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.792" offset="12236633">Once SORNA later came into effect, he probably wouldn't have been in violation of SORNA at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.603" offset="12259830">But -- but that -- there's nothing unusual about the fact that he could have engaged in pre-enactment conduct that would have prevented him from being in violation, just as the person convicted of a misdemeanor possession -- misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, if he doesn't possess a gun before the -- the new provision in 922 comes into effect, then he hasn't committed the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.875" offset="12352930">If somebody doesn't acquire the alcohol before the statutory prohibition comes into effect that was at issue in Samuels before that law came into effect, then he hadn't committed the offense.</text>
