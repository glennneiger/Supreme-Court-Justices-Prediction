            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">We will hear argument this morning in Case 08-1151, Stop the Beach Renourishment v. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection.</text>

            <label>Mr. D. Kent Safriet</label>
            <text syncTime="10.222" offset="146328">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Today we ask this Court to expressly recognize that a State court decision, unpredictable in terms of relevant precedents, which redefines century-old property rights to no longer exist, violates the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.083" offset="217799">The Florida Supreme Court suddenly and dramatically redefined littoral property rights, converting oceanfront property into oceanview property to avoid the finding of a taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.708" offset="260221">It did so in the context of a beach restoration project which could have been accomplished without taking any private property at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.295" offset="290628">Given this Court's jurisprudence that a State's legislative and executive branches cannot violate the Fifth Amendment, we see no reason why the judicial branch should be treated any differently.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="57.687" offset="336185">I thought your basic position in the litigation in Florida was that the Florida legislation violated the takings protection, and so it's kind of strange to switch your target from the legislature, which enacted this measure, and then say, because the judiciary upheld it, the judiciary somehow is complicit in this violation by the legislature implemented by the administrative offices.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. D. Kent Safriet</label>
            <text syncTime="95.628" offset="487905">That is correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.028" offset="493547">Below, the case was litigated as one of a taking by the legislature when it passed the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.216" offset="518311">When it passed the Beach and Shore Preservation Act, it contained a provision within section 161.141, which is a savings clause, that said to the extent the beach restoration cannot be accomplished without taking property rights, the requesting authorities have to use eminent domain proceedings to take those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.760" offset="584453">At the First District Court of Appeal, they agreed with us that the littoral rights were being taken by the Act of the legislature and that those had to be compensated for.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.349" offset="622801">When we arrived at the Florida Supreme Court, again, all of the parties were arguing those issues, whether there was a physical taking of these rights or a regulatory taking of these rights by the Act and whether the savings clause would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.193" offset="674210">To everybody's shock, the Florida Supreme Court said: We're going to go back to step one and decide you don't have any littoral rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.846" offset="704825">The legislature didn't eliminate any protected littoral rights that you thought you once had for over a hundred years as the relevant precedents in common law indicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.404" offset="743069">So it was that decision of the Florida Supreme Court, that said you have -- no longer have property, that gives rise to the issue before this Court is, can the Florida Supreme Court redefine those 100-year-old rights to no longer exist?</text>

            <text syncTime="174.997" offset="805449">It was never the kind of situation involved here with the beach restoration project.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.520" offset="839513">The -- the precedent did not involve the kind of situation that this case presents.</text>

            <text syncTime="195.041" offset="885593">There is no precedent with respect to the Beach and Shore Preservation Act as it has ever been applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.362" offset="906909">We do concede that.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.895" offset="912969">However, there are two fundamental principles of Florida law that have existed for more than a hundred years, and those are property that must -- property that borders the mean high-water line and must remain in contact with the mean high-water line to possess common law littoral rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.469" offset="971274">If that connection is not there, there are no common law littoral rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.106" offset="985799">Common law littoral rights are constitutionally protected and cannot be taken without due process and just compensation.</text>

            <text syncTime="227.093" offset="1013802">Well, they're -- they're eliminated -- at least the right of contact with the water can be eliminated by an avulsion, right?</text>
            <text syncTime="234.949" offset="1045253">When there's -- when there's avulsion, even at common law and under Florida law, it -- it can happen that some land between the property owner and -- and the water will be owned by the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="254.394" offset="1122994">--Well, because the avulsion in this case, Your Honor, was the hurricanes that the State cites as the reason for the beaches being washed away, and -- and it was--</text>

            <text syncTime="265.552" offset="1167611">There were -- there were two avulsions.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.152" offset="1173985">One was the avulsion of its being washed away and the other was the -- the rapid replacement of sand.</text>

            <text syncTime="278.626" offset="1219960">--That is right, Your Honor, but the -- there is no case law in Florida or no principle that says avulsion can occur by artificial means.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.463" offset="1251307">So there is -- the beach restoration, where they placed sand on the beach, is not avulsion.</text>

            <text syncTime="294.386" offset="1282968">No, the case law specifically says that avulsion is a result of natural occurrences, by the action of the wind and the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.289" offset="1310553">That's what avulsion is in Florida and has been -- you know, for at least 50 years, I believe.</text>

            <text syncTime="307.043" offset="1333541">They have a new situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.926" offset="1337093">It's sort of like an avulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.495" offset="1347438">It's sort of like an accretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.280" offset="1354543">The only precedent of -- you keep talking about a hundred years -- it seemed to me some dictum in a case called Sand Key, which does say that the upland property owner has the right to touch the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.190" offset="1410132">So in this case, the Florida Supreme Court says the purpose of that was to make certain that the upland property owner could go to the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.998" offset="1457361">And so here we have a case that assures he can go to the water, and they have a new situation, which, as I think Justice Scalia said, looks an awful lot like an avulsion, though of course there are differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.555" offset="1511591">So it sounds like a typical common law situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.273" offset="1526533">A new situation arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.542" offset="1535624">You try to apply old precedent, and they reached the result they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.696" offset="1556208">Now, what's your response to that?</text>
            <text syncTime="364.279" offset="1562582">Because that's the argument the other side makes.</text>

            <text syncTime="375.420" offset="1607095">So when an avulsion event occurs, the landowner that has lost property has a right under common law to reclaim what they lost.</text>
