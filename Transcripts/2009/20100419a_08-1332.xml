            <label>Mr. Kent L. Richland</label>
            <text syncTime="6.138" offset="130947">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Under the less restrictive constitutional standards applied when government acts as employer, as opposed to sovereign, there was no Fourth Amendment violation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.944" offset="190192">First, Ontario Police Sergeant Jeff Quon had no reasonable expectation of privacy vis-Ã -vis the Ontario Police Department in text messages on his department-issued pager in light of the operational realities of his workplace, which included the explicit no privacy in text messages policy.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="43.885" offset="281934">The written policy?</text>
            <text syncTime="44.919" offset="286114">[Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="46.510" offset="292488">The whole -- the argument here, of course, is that that was modified by the instructions he got from the lieutenant.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.993" offset="322372">Do we follow the written policy or the policy they allegedly enforced in practice?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kent_l_richland" startTime="59.036" stopTime="122.386">
            <label>Mr. Kent L. Richland</label>
            <text syncTime="59.036" offset="342538">That is the argument, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.145" offset="351002">But, in fact, there was no inconsistency between the no privacy in text messages aspect of the written policy and the oral information he was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.310" offset="399694">First of all, the written policy itself was broad enough to cover text messages.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.776" offset="425503">It stated, for example, at Appendix 152, that it applied to city-owned computers and all associated equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.774" offset="457582">And again at 152:</text>
            <text syncTime="89.946" offset="466254">"City-owned computer equipment, computer peripheral, city networks, the Internet, e-mail, or other city-related computer services. "</text>
            <text syncTime="98.802" offset="501676">And, finally, the agreement to the policy was that it applied -- this is at Appendix 156 -- to city-owned computers and related equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.423" offset="536158">So certainly the written policy itself was broad enough to cover text messaging pagers, but in addition to that, nothing in the oral statements made by Lieutenant Duke undermined the no-privacy aspect of the written policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="146.595" offset="692788">Now, can't you sort of put all those together and say that it would be reasonable for him to assume that private messages were his business?</text>
            <text syncTime="153.950" offset="722254">They said he can do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1003.775" offset="4121516">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Millions of employees today use technologies of their -- of their employers under policies established by those employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.005" offset="4158506">When a government employer has a no-privacy policy in place that governs the use of those technologies, ad hoc statements by a non-policy member cannot create a reasonable expectation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.156" offset="4207094">Put most simply, the computer help desk cannot supplant the chief's desk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.766" offset="4225484">That simple, clear rule should have decided this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.734" offset="4237396">Instead, the Ninth Circuit found that the 1999 policy applied to pagers, but then concluded that that 1999 policy was informally modified years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.777" offset="4281595">And that decision should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.976" offset="4290372">It disregards this Court's repeated holdings, including 2 years ago in the Chief Justice's opinion in Engquist v. Oregon about the greater amount of leeway that the government has when it acts as an employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.598" offset="4340840">And it also is not consistent with the plurality opinion in O'Connor, which observed that when the government adopts a policy that its employees lack privacy, no reasonable expectation of privacy exists.</text>

            <text syncTime="3475.146" offset="14006983">I would first like to just make it clear that what it is being claimed was the guarantee of privacy by Lieutenant Duke is really absolutely not that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.093" offset="14054839">And I would refer the Court to Joint Appendix page 40, which does summarize that, and it says -- here is what precisely what Lieutenant Duke said:</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.650" offset="14085036">"Because of the overage Lieutenant Duke went to Sergeant Quon and told him the city-issued two-way pagers were considered e-mail and could be audited. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.131" offset="14122966">So that's what he said first.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.804" offset="14129654">Then he said -- he told Sergeant Quon it was not his -- his intent to audit employees' text messages to see if the overages were due to work-related transmissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.894" offset="14174062">He advised Sergeant Quon he, Sergeant Quon, could reimburse the city for the overages so he, Duke, would not have to audit the transmission and see how many messages were non-work-related.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.479" offset="14228396">Lieutenant Duke told Sergeant Quon he is doing this because if anybody wished to challenge their overage, he could audit the text transmissions to verify how many were non-work-related, and then, finally, Lieutenant Duke added, the text messages were considered public records and could be audited at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.756" offset="14301435">That is what is being characterized as a guarantee of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.489" offset="14316377">It's hard to see how that in any way undercuts the official written policy.</text>
