            <text syncTime="17.026" offset="174519">In pertinent part, if two subsections are -- are satisfied, the rule permits relation back of an amendment adding a new defendant after expiration of the limitations period.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.685" offset="225196">The courts below found, and Respondent does not question, that we satisfied the first subsection: Notice and no prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.458" offset="268246">That arose from the service of the original complaint upon Costa Cruise, the agent and corporate affiliate represented by the same attorney as Respondent Costa Crociere.</text>

            <text syncTime="436.998" offset="1854401">Most of the cases would say that an amendment like that to add the actual name, once you have identified the status of the defendant you seek to sue, falls within the subsection (ii), which is addressed primarily to the constructive notice of the defendant, that they knew or should have known that they would have been brought in the suit but for a mistake concerning the proper party's identity.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.297" offset="1955652">But the general focus of that second subsection, I think, is to look to whether this defendant knew or should have known that it was the intended target.</text>

            <text syncTime="513.664" offset="2161079">Well, actually when it talks of mistake, it seems to me that the very notion of mistake connotes error.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.603" offset="2200889">I looked at a couple of definitions, dictionary definitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.840" offset="2221787">Merriam Webster's defines a mistake as, quote, "a wrong judgment" or, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="534.577" offset="2244775">"a wrong action or statement proceeding from faulty judgment, inadequate knowledge, or inattention. "</text>
            <text syncTime="541.065" offset="2270689">So, at least in that colloquial sense, the very nature of mistake implies some measure of blameworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.921" offset="2302140">And, indeed, it's hard to conceive of a mistake that couldn't be avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.806" offset="2321680">And I think that's the problem with looking to the ticket, because what the definition on the ticket essentially says is: With due diligence, you might have avoided the mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.428" offset="2364207">But in my view, and I think in the view of the language of the rule, that doesn't change the very nature of it as being a mistake.</text>

            <text syncTime="3121.270" offset="12591564">What the district court said was: I adopt the legal premise that if you knew before the filing of -- before the running of the statute of limitations but didn't sue, that would not be a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.097" offset="12642868">And here, says the district court judge, they filed their answer after the statute of limitations, and that's why you lose under a rule that requires that notice before the statute of limitations expires.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.238" offset="12695427">That was the district court rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.440" offset="12704204">The circuit court was the one who relied upon the imputed knowledge notion that is now, I think, disavowed by Respondent himself.</text>

            <text syncTime="3211.577" offset="12952785">And the rule itself -- I understood Justice Scalia's point to be that the interpretation of the rule is designed to be liberal in its application to avoid the forfeiture of potentially meritorious causes of action over technical mistakes which have nothing to do with the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="3244.817" offset="13085696">Their motion for summary judgment was filed on May 6th.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.352" offset="13099802">Two days later, the court erroneously dismissed the lawsuit for a period of approximately a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.673" offset="13125089">It was then reinstated on June 5th, and our response, which sought relation back, was filed on June 13th.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.879" offset="13158003">So in addition to the scheduling order, there is a 1-month period of time in which the case was erroneously dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.402" offset="13192067">So if it were significant, we could say there's not significant delay.</text>
