            <text syncTime="8.054" offset="137655">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Long-time lawful permanent resident aliens with two convictions for minor drug possession offenses are subject to removal from the United States, but they are not categorically ineligible to seek discretionary relief from removal from the Attorney General based on their connections and deep family ties to the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.115" offset="217903">Categorical ineligibility for discretionary relief arises under the Immigration and Nationality Act when a permanent resident has been, quote, "convicted of an aggravated felony", close quote, with the relevant category here permanent residents who have been, quote,</text>

            <text syncTime="60.487" offset="347366">Mr. Srinivasan, as a threshold question, is there a mootness problem here, because, as I understand it, the Petitioner came back to the country illegally and committed another minor crime?</text>
            <text syncTime="84.035" offset="441511">But his coming back illegally and being turned away again, as I understand the law, means that he cannot get any dispensation as a result of the illegal entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.814" offset="504728">So even if we were to hold in your favor now, I take it that he could not -- he would not have any hope of getting any cancellation of removal or any other dispensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.871" offset="552897">Is that so?</text>

            <label>Mr. Sri Srinivasan</label>
            <text syncTime="112.771" offset="556554">That's not correct, Justice Ginsburg, in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.156" offset="566063">And the government, it's notable, doesn't make a mootness argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.775" offset="576512">And I think the reason they don't is that the -- in Lopez, this Court understood that the initial removal doesn't annul the ability of an individual to get cancellation.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.064" offset="613710">And so, as Your Honor correctly observes, the question would be whether the reentry has an effect on the cancellation and the eligibility for cancellation.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.885" offset="644953">And it does not because Petitioner was removed again by reinstatement of the original removal order.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.272" offset="670553">And so, if there's an argument that the initial removal order wasn't good because cancellation should have been granted, that also carries through to the reinstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.710" offset="700228">And as a consequence of that procedural context, there is no mootness argument and I think that's why the government doesn't make -- doesn't take that position.</text>

            <text syncTime="860.378" offset="3546948">But it's important to note, Justice Kennedy, that doesn't mean that those prior convictions don't enter into the picture at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.532" offset="3567532">They do, because, in the exercise of discretion by the Attorney General, the Attorney General can take into account any prior convictions, including those that don't render somebody categorically ineligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.972" offset="3605358">All we're talking about here is whether the person has a chance to make a discretionary case.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.507" offset="3623434">They do have that chance in Your Honor's hypothetical, but those convictions would be taken into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.493" offset="3643392">Now, I want to point out, though, that there's another reason that I think the fact that in that hypothetical it wouldn't render the defendant categorically ineligible for discretionary relief shouldn't give the Court a great deal of pause.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.885" offset="3684979">And that's because the relevant category of aggravated felony that we're talking about here is illicit trafficking in a controlled substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.539" offset="3711624">That's the category that's outlined by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.991" offset="3721341">Now, with respect to that category, every State has trafficking laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.026" offset="3737537">Every State punishes drug trafficking.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.145" offset="3746001">So every State's offenses do count for purposes of this category of aggravated felony.</text>

            <text syncTime="917.049" offset="3773586">The tip of the iceberg is recidivist possession, which is a subset of illicit trafficking in a controlled substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.618" offset="3795843">Now, with respect to that tip, Federal convictions for recidivist possession still do count, so we have those.</text>

            <text syncTime="962.945" offset="3957175">Now, I think what may be -- what may be sort of lurking beneath Your Honor's question is the recognition that the Federal consequences of a State conviction are going to turn on State prosecutorial decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="974.920" offset="4005136">But that's a fixed feature of any scheme in which Federal immigration consequences turns on what happens in State court, and this Court's decision in Lopez recognizes that.</text>

            <text syncTime="991.330" offset="4070755">What States, some States, have instead is possession with a degree of penalty attached to the amount of drugs possessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.501" offset="4095415">They don't have the separate offense of possession with intent to distribute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1019.699" offset="4184231">In those States that do, where the State has the offense and where the State prosecutor makes the decision to charge under that offense will -- at that point the State conviction will count as a Federal felony.</text>

            <text syncTime="1416.868" offset="5772894">And it wouldn't in the Federal system, and by parity of reasoning it also would not have that consequence in the State system.</text>

            <text syncTime="3134.219" offset="12642262">It's not the kind thing that this Court has said under Almendarez-Torres needs to be treated like an offense element.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.837" offset="12660757">I should note that -- and this is the point you made, Justice Breyer, that there was not a recidivist enhancement available in Texas court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.676" offset="12692104">Justice Kennedy, that just highlights some of the problems that you identified in terms of the wide variations that we would see in how similarly situated people who have done the same things, two drug possession offenses, would be treated differently under the immigration laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.619" offset="12747901">And that's just not what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.652" offset="12756052">We talk in our brief -- and there's a long list of differences in State laws, not only in the State procedures, which vary widely from Federal court, but in the State laws in terms of, you know, if you can consider a second possession offense for recidivist enhancement, or only a third or fourth; whether the first offense has to be final, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.530" offset="12827523">That there -- these differences would just lead to a -- a patchwork application laws of the immigration laws, and if there's any place where we don't want that, it's -- it's in immigration, with respect to immigration consequences.</text>

            <text syncTime="3271.021" offset="13189475">But what Congress decided was that it had to balance its need for uniformity with a rule that is administrable, and the rule that it picked as administrable is, let's look at the offense conduct that was established by the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.229" offset="13234301">And when you look at that offense conduct, you have to ask how it could be punished in Federal court.</text>
