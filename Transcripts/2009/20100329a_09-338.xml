            <text syncTime="12.141" offset="154979">Because this is a habeas case arising from a murder conviction obtained in the Michigan courts, the threshold question under AEDPA is whether there is any clearly established Supreme Court precedent that the Michigan Supreme Court objectively, unreasonably applied in rejecting Mr. Lett's claims that the trial court had abused its discretion in -- in discharging the jury due to deadlock.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.571" offset="244736">The Sixth Circuit second-guessed on habeas, ignored deference under AEDPA, as well as the broad discretion, due the trial court determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="244.084" offset="1082744">And then the trial court did not declare a mistrial at that point.</text>
