            <text syncTime="11.891" offset="153015">Possessory and use taxes are extremely difficult to collect, even under the best of circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.212" offset="178301">Indeed, here the city alleges in its second amended complaint that it only collected 40 cents on the dollar, and its response claims a collection rate of 55 cents on the dollar.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.233" offset="218321">Yet it wants to collect 300 cents on the dollar from my clients, who never owed these taxes in the first place.</text>

            <text syncTime="48.564" offset="299719">The alleged lost opportunity to tax was based on claims that my clients and 50 other defendants in four consolidated cases did not send names of customers to the State of New York and had statements on their website saying sales were tax-free and no tobacco taxes applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.608" offset="367846">The Federal district court dismissed all claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.410" offset="383101">The Second Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated one of the city's RICO claims against the Petitioners, the Hemi Group and its sole owner, Kai Gachupin, and affirmed dismissal of the city's other RICO and its common law fraud claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.885" offset="432943">Yet reinstating the one RICO claim was improper because the city does not have standing to sue, based on the injuries that it has alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.324" offset="466693">It does not have standing because the city's claim that it lost the sovereign opportunity to tax is not an injury to -- to business, and it's not an injury to property.</text>

Oklahoma, where in an original jurisdiction case Wyoming sued the State of Oklahoma on the ground that the State's regulation which attempted to require Oklahoma coal-fired generation plants to use 10 percent of Oklahoma coal, and prior to the legislation all of Wyoming coal was used in the generation plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.556" offset="6371621">Wyoming sued in this Court and the defense was that Wyoming didn't have an interest because it lost the opportunity to collect taxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1663.887" offset="6760950">In this particular case, the reason we don't have the taxes is because of the act of fraud as we allege of the defendant.</text>
