            <text syncTime="6.668" offset="132117">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The court of appeals erred in holding that reversal of Respondent's conviction was appropriate on plain error review if there was any possibility, no matter how unlikely, that the jury's verdict was based entirely on conduct predating the enactment of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.004" offset="205469">Under Rule 52(b), a defendant asserting a forfeited claim of error may prevail only by showing at a minimum a reasonable possibility that the error actually affected the outcome of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.046" offset="253639">In particular, the fourth prong of the Olano plain error test requires a defendant to show a serious effect on the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.214" offset="298256">That test calls for a case-specific, fact-intensive inquiry, and the defendant cannot satisfy it if there is no reasonable possibility that the error affected the outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.663" offset="336081">The decision of the court of appeals is inconsistent with this Court's cases applying prong four of the plain error test, Johnson, Cotton, and most recently Puckett from just last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.518" offset="379444">Puckett established that the prong four inquiry is case-specific and fact-intensive and that a per se rule at prong four is inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.811" offset="416643">And that's exactly what the court of appeals adopted here, applying a per se rule that if there's any possibility of prejudice, reversal is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.791" offset="452587">In addition, Johnson and Cotton made clear that when the error is one that affects an issue on which the evidence is overwhelming or essentially uncontroverted, the defendant has not shown a serious effect on the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings, and, indeed, reversal in that context on the basis of a forfeited error that didn't affect the outcome would undermine public confidence in the judicial system.</text>

            <text syncTime="123.525" offset="599500">This Court has reserved the question of whether, for example, a structural error would automatically satisfy the "affects substantial rights" component of the -- of prong three of the Olano test.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eric D. Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="139.365" offset="662925">Well, the sort of error that, if properly preserved, would result in automatic reversal without an assessment of harmlessness.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eric D. Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="153.606" offset="719872">Well, I mean in Johnson, for example, the Court had not yet decided Neder, and so in Johnson it was unclear whether the omission of one element, the failure to instruct the jury on one element of the offense, was a structural error.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.458" offset="775252">And in Johnson, the Court said, even assuming that that's a structural error and even assuming that, therefore, the defendant has satisfied prong three, showing an effect on the substantial rights, nonetheless the court of appeals has to apply prong four and has to evaluate on the basis of the record and the facts in that particular case whether there was an effect on the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of judicial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.122" offset="873890">And in that case, the Court said that there wasn't, because the evidence on the point that was the subject of the instructional error was overwhelming, and essentially uncontroverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.005" offset="917462">And that's, in our view, the sort of analysis, the sort of case-specific assessment of the facts the court of appeals should have undertaken in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.565" offset="951630">The effect of the decision below is essentially to carve out a special rule of plain error review that's applicable only to a particular kind of error; namely--</text>

            <text syncTime="222.047" offset="993635">Prong three of -- of Olano looks to prejudice, right?</text>
            <text syncTime="227.433" offset="1015160">And then it's your position that prong four also looks to prejudice?</text>
            <text syncTime="231.604" offset="1031879">Where you have two prejudice inquiries, one is more searching than the other, perhaps?</text>
            <text syncTime="238.397" offset="1059046">How do they fit together in that relation -- in that regard?</text>

            <text syncTime="241.350" offset="1070853">--Well, that's -- that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.005" offset="1081407">We think that prong three in the case of a constitutional error requires at least a reasonable possibility of prejudice, and prong four I think demands at least that much and, in some cases, may demand more.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.033" offset="1133547">One example of a case where a defendant could satisfy prong three but not prong four would be, for example, a Melendez-Diaz kind of error.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.558" offset="1175656">If you had a drug possession case where the only evidence that the substance the defendant possessed was cocaine was a laboratory certificate admitted without confrontation, that would be a plain error under Melendez-Diaz, and that would -- the defendant would be able to show an effect on his substantial rights, because if that was the only piece of evidence, he would have been entitled to a directed verdict without it.</text>

            <text syncTime="294.984" offset="1285371">But looking at prong four, the Court would say -- I mean, if, for example, the defendant had had an opportunity to subpoena the chemist, if he hadn't controverted the accuracy of the report, there would be no basis for concluding on those facts that there was a serious effect on the fairness or integrity or reputation of the proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="314.726" offset="1364365">You answered Justice Alito by saying there are cases in which your inquiry is more searching, more demanding, under four.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.347" offset="1390801">It might also be the other way around.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.676" offset="1400101">I mean, if you satisfy -- if, under three, you find that it hasn't affected the outcome, then I don't know where you'd go under four.</text>

            <text syncTime="361.130" offset="1549939">--There is some overlap in the inquiries, but we think that, you know, as the Court made clear in Puckett, rule four requires a fact-intensive, case-specific inquiry.</text>

            <text syncTime="370.985" offset="1589332">So under -- under three, the court could conclude that the defendant has shown that it isn't clear beyond a reasonable doubt, for a constitutional error, that the error didn't affect the outcome, so the defendant would clear prong three, but in prong four, a defendant might still lose if it's fairly clear, but not beyond a reasonable doubt that -- is that -- that how it would work?</text>

            <text syncTime="398.082" offset="1697792">Or if, you know, as in the -- my Melendez-Diaz example, or if the nature of the evidence in the case shows that, you know, apart from the effect on the defendant's rights of that particular error, that error, in the context of the case, doesn't undermine public confidence in the outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.654" offset="1776055">What the court of appeals did here was to create a special rule applicable only to those errors involving the failure to instruct the jury that they may not convict solely on pre-enactment evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.354" offset="1818791">The court didn't give any reason why those errors should be treated differently from other kinds of errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.317" offset="1838644">Instead, it was simply applying a line of circuit precedent that went back to cases predating Olano.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.097" offset="1861841">And there is no reason for creating a special rule in that context.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.300" offset="1878664">To the contrary, Johnson emphatically rejected the proposition that there are errors that are not subject to Rule 52(b) analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.218" offset="1914295">And the Court said that even errors implicating fundamental constitutional rights like the Sixth Amendment -- Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury in Johnson or the Fifth Amendment right to a grand jury in Cotton are also subject to the application--</text>

            <text syncTime="475.862" offset="2008858">We think that's particularly appropriate because of the fact and record-intensive nature of the argument in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.061" offset="2037697">So, if the Court does reach that issue, we would urge the Court to adopt the analysis of the concurring judges below, who said that, with respect to the forced labor conviction, Respondent's conduct in the pre-enactment and post-enactment periods were essentially identical, such that there is no basis in the record on which a rational jury could have concluded that he violated the statute in the pre-enactment period--</text>

            <text syncTime="507.503" offset="2135395">The point may be tangential, but if both counsel were aware of the date problem, that 2001 was the enactment of the statute, and the jury was later properly instructed, do you think that the government would find it important to introduce the evidence of the pre-enactment conduct, just to set forth scheme, plan, design, purpose, to tell the jury the story?</text>

            <text syncTime="543.522" offset="2279487">In order to establish a violation of the forced-labor statute, the government had to show that Respondent had obtained labor services by threats of serious harm or by a scheme, pattern, or plan intended to cause the victim to believe that she would suffer serious harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.530" offset="2343539">And so, in this case, there was essentially a uniform course of conduct of the Respondent obtaining labor services, making threats of harm, and, indeed, brutally carrying out those threats.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.432" offset="2391186">And so the pre-enactment threats and pre-enactment acts carrying out the threats would certainly be relevant to show that the post-enactment threats were indeed genuine threats and that the victim could take them seriously as threats, and that they did indeed induce her to provide the labor or services.</text>

            <text syncTime="2201.398" offset="8911036">No, of course, but the question is whether the mere possibility standard would apply in that case as well, or whether you think this mere possibility standard applies only in the case of pre-enactment conduct?</text>

            <label>Mr. Herald P. Fahringer</label>
            <text syncTime="2213.751" offset="8960460">I think the possibility standard only applies to ex post facto statute cases and pre-enactment conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.279" offset="8994523">That's my view, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.791" offset="9004554">I think it's a very narrow holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.745" offset="9012391">And I'm not urging that this would be the standard for other -- other than ex post facto cases, and I'm not urging this would be the standard in ex post facto cases where -- what this does, Your Honor, if you stop and think about it, it is, in a sense, a bright-line rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.893" offset="9076966">What has gone on in the past is we have to measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.767" offset="9088460">We have to take, on the one hand, the post -- enactment conduct, and we take, on the other hand, the pre-enactment conduct, and we go through this, what I -- I'm of a generation -- I remember Betts v. Brady before Gideon came down, and it was always a constant citing in that context whether a person got able representation until you decided the Gideon case, Gideon v. Wainwright.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.025" offset="9185531">Aren't we in the same position here?</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.850" offset="9192845">Wouldn't it be better to have a rule that said, where clearly you shouldn't be bringing in pre-enactment conduct anyway, if you bring in pre-enactment conduct and there is any possibility that the jury convicted on that, there will be a new trial?</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.642" offset="9251986">It seems that's going to avoid all of that balancing and weighing and perennial -- perennial appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.186" offset="9282184">That's what I think is -- is commendable about the Second Circuit's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.449" offset="9307261">I think that's where there is a great deal of sense behind it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2325.972" offset="9409348">I mean, I think there's a misconception among some people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.282" offset="9426589">We -- the Second Circuit took the four Olano factors and applied them, one, two, three, four.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.964" offset="9453234">They didn't touch them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.122" offset="9457936">They didn't in any way alter them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.341" offset="9466817">What they did is, on the concept and the rule governing ex post facto adjudications, that was purely substantive, but the any possibility doesn't apply to plain error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.677" offset="9520107">Those four prongs have been left intact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.913" offset="9537034">And so they haven't disturbed that in any way whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.033" offset="9549573">They set those four prongs out in the preamble of their opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.534" offset="9563575">Obviously, what they found was, when you have a case of this magnitude of pre-enactment conduct of 2 years, they felt that that certainly affected the fairness and the integrity of the trial and the judicial reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.794" offset="9620626">I say it myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.261" offset="9626478">It appeared on the front page of The New York Times: Man convicted for 2 years of conduct where there was no law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.491" offset="9655421">That, I would guess, would have an adverse effect on the reputation of our judicial process, whereas a ruling where a court held this man should go back and get a new trial on the conduct that violated the statute, and not on conduct that violated no law, would enhance the reputation of the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.249" offset="9738386">So applying that factor, we feel strongly and powerfully that the correct disposition here is to affirm the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.340" offset="9786765">And we will go back and we will have a retrial on the conduct that violated the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.273" offset="9806514">If you have no other questions, I -- I thank you for your attention.</text>

            <text syncTime="2434.051" offset="9841622">Just very brief -- excuse me -- very briefly, I'd like to make two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.938" offset="9877149">The first is that, essentially, the error in this case was the failure to give a limiting instruction relating to the use of pre-enactment evidence, and that's the same sort of instructional or evidentiary error that can be considered in a case-specific analysis under prong four and should have been considered through that analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.010" offset="9953426">The second is that Respondent suggested there was a lack of jurisdiction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.070" offset="9977668">That argument rests on an understanding of jurisdiction that this Court rejected in Cotton, and we discussed that at pages 9 to 11 of our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.006" offset="10009433">If the Court has no further questions, we ask that the judgment be reversed and the case remanded.</text>
