            <text syncTime="11.087" offset="150800">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.368" offset="159890">The issue in this case is whether the word "administrative" as used in the public disclosure bar of the False Claims Act includes State audits and reports or is limited to Federal sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.505" offset="204507">If this Court were to hold that a relator can simply copy a State report or a State criminal indictment and then proceed with a qui tam action, there will be a proliferation of opportunistic qui tam actions brought under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.589" offset="280785">Such construction of the statute would have a devastating effect upon States, local governments, and the Federal fisc.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.571" offset="312759">Much of the work of State government involves cooperative Federal and State programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.179" offset="335120">States have been an effective partner in fighting against fraud and abuse with respect to those programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.642" offset="365004">For example, many States have turned to computerized software to identify irregularities in connection with Medicaid billings.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.841" offset="401784">California has implemented a process of analyzing both its Medicare and its Medicaid databases in order to identify doctors who bill in excess of 24 hours in a given day.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.644" offset="461030">Under the decision below, that investigatory work can simply be copied by a qui tam plaintiff and an action brought based upon that public report.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.624" offset="516932">The result is--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="104.438" offset="524246">But under your proposal a State that itself is guilty of fraud can, in effect, immunize -- if not immunize itself, at least render the information unusable by conducting a hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="120.897" offset="590075">--Well, Your Honor, the government certainly argues that it would result in State and local governments immunizing themselves from qui tam liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.833" offset="629781">With respect to States, the Fourth Circuit's decision expressly includes reports of the State government.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.283" offset="663531">States, of course, are not liable under the qui tam provisions, as a result of this Court's decision in Vermont Department of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>

            <text syncTime="158.245" offset="739391">Yes -- yes, Justice Ginsburg, that -- even if there is a State report that a -- that a -- is in the public domain, a local government could still be sued under that document, if -- in spite of that document, by either the United States or a qui tam plaintiff that stands as an original source.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.201" offset="831237">So--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="182.016" offset="834476">But what about the argument that Congress wanted to, in its most recent provisions, wanted to expand qui tam availability and this would -- if you would -- if you include State and local reports, that will shrink the availability?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="christopher_g_browning_jr" startTime="207.644" stopTime="371.789">
            <label>Mr. Christopher G. Browning, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="207.644" offset="936981">--Your Honor, there is no question that Congress looked at the pre-1986 public disclosure bar, the provisions that existed between 1943 and 1986, and during that time frame an action, a qui tam action, would be barred if it was based upon information that was available to the -- the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.960" offset="1046277">Congress decided that that cut off too many qui tam actions, and as a result it reached a compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.176" offset="1071146">Many members of Congress wanted to totally eliminate the government knowledge bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.985" offset="1098418">On the other hand, the United States Department of Justice at the time was arguing that the existing bar should remain in effect as a result of abusive and frivolous qui tam actions and their concern with respect to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.636" offset="1152961">So a compromise was reached in which the bar was completely changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.552" offset="1176680">It was changed to allow for a -- for an original source to bring the qui tam action, essentially a relief valve that addressed Congress's concerns with respect to cases such as United States ex rel. Wisconsin v. Dean.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.516" offset="1248465">It also in the 1986 amendments set out specific sources of information and directly identified the type of public information that a qui tam action can be based upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.869" offset="1309905">That list, of course, includes many sources that might or might not be readily available to the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.927" offset="1346163">For example, it includes reports by a news media.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.237" offset="1363404">A -- an obscure article in a weekly publication of limited circulation does not realistically put the government on notice of a particular fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.481" offset="1420351">The same can be true -- said with regard to an action filed in Federal court, a private action between civil litigants based upon diversity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.476" offset="1468312">If that -- if there is a summary judgment motion filed in that case and there are a number of depositions, one of which might indicate fraud, that are filed in that summary judgment motion and the case settles, that -- there will never be -- that summary judgment motion wouldn't be reviewed by the Federal district court judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.982" offset="1546365">But still, there is no question that the filing of that document with the Federal court would constitute a public disclosure under the first clause of the public disclosure bar.</text>

            <text syncTime="3312.333" offset="13355802">Justice Breyer, if I could first turn to your comments or your questions about legislative history; here, I think the legislative history tells us very little because of the many changes in the Senate version and the House version, and unfortunately, there was not a conference committee report, so we won't know the nature of the compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.791" offset="13437618">At most, the legislative history helps us to show what Congress was generally concerned about, and throughout the original committee, the Senate and House report, there is a concern about qui tam actions based upon public information.</text>
