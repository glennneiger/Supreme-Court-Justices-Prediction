            <text syncTime="9.356" offset="143903">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Unlike courts, arbitrators derive their authority solely from the consent of the parties to a particular agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.663" offset="189147">That agreement determines not only what the parties have agreed to arbitrate, but just as fundamentally, with whom they have agreed to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.102" offset="226868">And when the agreement reveals no intent, no meeting of the minds to add participants, but the arbitrators nonetheless extend their reach to hundreds of parties of other contracts, they violate the basic principle reflected in the FAA that their authority is created and circumscribed by an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.135" offset="326969">The decision to impose class proceedings is not the kind of incidental procedural matter that arbitrators have to resolve in order to discharge their responsibilities under the foundational agreement.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="71.429" offset="392171">Mr. Waxman, there's a preliminary question in this case, and that is: There was one agreement, undoubtedly signed by both sides, and that was the one to submit to the arbitrator the question whether the arbitration clause permitted class treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.509" offset="476494">The arbitrators answered that question, which they were given authority to do so by both sides, and the Second Circuit said that the arbitrators answered within the ballpark.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.750" offset="533441">If we agree with that, then there's nothing else to consider in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="115.022" offset="566565">The arbitrators -- the agreement reflected in paragraph 7 of the supplemental agreement -- that is, to proceed to arbitration under the auspices of Rules 3 through 7 of the AAA rules, and Rule 3 itself contemplated precisely submitting precisely the contract issue that the Bazzle plurality said should go to the arbitrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.054" offset="666666">That is, looking at the arbitration clause itself, does it objectively reveal an agreement among the two parties to permit or prohibit class or consolidated treatment, or is it truly silent?</text>
            <text syncTime="159.265" offset="743466">That is a question of contract interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.781" offset="753601">That is the question that was submitted to the arbitrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.067" offset="766663">There is a separate statutory question that arises if the answer to the contract question is number 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.339" offset="799786">There is no meeting of the minds.</text>

            <text syncTime="333.865" offset="1441876">Well, our understanding -- what Bazzle said is, at the very beginning of the opinion -- look, here's the case: The South Carolina Supreme Court found that the arbitration clause is truly silent, and it then applied a rule of State law that says, if it's silent, class treatment will be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.493" offset="1516377">We granted certiorari in this case to decide whether that rule of South Carolina law applied to this case is precluded by the FAA, which requires actual consent, not coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.753" offset="1577503">Now, what the plurality in Bazzle, with respect, said is: We can't reach the legal question, the statutory FAA question on which we granted review, because we can't be certain that the contract really is silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.232" offset="1647407">To be sure, there's no express provision, but Bazzle -- the Bazzle plaintiffs say that it is silent, and Green Tree says, no, if you look at other words in it, including the right to choose each arbitrator for each arbitration, it's not -- the South Carolina courts answered the question, but they are not the ones, because when you are talking about a question of the interpretation of a contract that has committed to arbitration, that is for the arbitrators to decide.</text>

            <text syncTime="3605.231" offset="14527342">Three points, so I will take 25 seconds for each point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.283" offset="14539567">First of all, these contracts in the class are not all the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.901" offset="14554091">These are form contracts that are drafted by the charterers and their brokers, and they involve different clauses, including different arbitration clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.341" offset="14587841">The second point, the Rule 3, I think, fairly does encapsulate the question that the parties presented to the Court, which is to construe the contract, the question that the Bazzle plurality sent back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.934" offset="14646147">The AAA amicus brief in this case, which I commend to the Court, on behalf of no party says over and over and over again, we drafted the rules to provide procedures to answer the Bazzle contract question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.674" offset="14697138">We have no opinion about the answer to the Federal statutory question that arises if the answer to the -- the meeting-of-the-minds question is no meeting of the minds as a matter of contract law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.584" offset="14756801">And if you find -- and much of the discussion this morning has focused on this -- that, well, somehow the arbitrators did just decide the meeting-of-the-minds question, they didn't decide the legal consequences of no meeting of the minds, then just as in Keating and as in Bazzle, you will not be able to reach the very important, fundamental FAA statutory question in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.985" offset="14858365">And the next generation of lawyers will come before you or your successors to get it answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.870" offset="14877905">Now, as to the contract question, I do want to address your point, Justice Breyer, about the toolbox.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.209" offset="14907267">It is true that in answering the contract -- what is -- what did the parties intend?</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.129" offset="14934956">Was there really a meeting of the minds here?</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.129" offset="14943002">And, by the way, let me just say that when Ms. Pillard says, well, we don't know whether the parties in this industry agreed or disagreed, all of the -- the evidence was undisputed that since the days of Marco Polo the background principle in maritime law has been bilateral, rigorously bilateral.</text>
