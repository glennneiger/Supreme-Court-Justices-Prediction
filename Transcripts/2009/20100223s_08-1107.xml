            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="9.205" offset="142252">The Constitution provides that federal courts may hear controversies between citizens of different states.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.748" offset="176421">Let’s supposed the citizen of Nebraska brings a federal diversity case in Federal Court against the corporation that does some business in Nebraska, and some business elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.346" offset="222814">Is the corporation a citizen of Nebraska, same state so they couldn’t bring it or of a different state in which case they could?</text>
            <text syncTime="37.757" offset="256460">A congressional statute answers this question by stating that, “a corporation shall be deemed to a citizen of any State by which it has been incorporated and of the State where it has its principal place of business” that helps, but what does principal place of business mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="59.104" offset="341828">Lower courts have reached different conclusions, taking highly divergent approaches to the interpretive problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.143" offset="374011">One major treaty for example devotes 73 pages to describing a host of different tests used in different circuits, with some circuits emphasizing the locus of operations, others, the corporate nerve center and still others working with various combinations of plant size, service or sales centers, employment and other factors designed to locate a center of gravity.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.060" offset="485710">Ultimately, we conclude that the phrase “principal place of business” refers to what some lower courts have called the corporation's nerve center.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.217" offset="526252">The place where a corporation's officers direct, control and coordinate the corporations activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.596" offset="555823">Typically, the nerve center will be found at a corporation's headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.174" offset="574109">Our opinion sets forth our reasons for reaching this conclusion in some detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.718" offset="596261">They include our reliance upon the statute language, for example, the phrase “principal place of business” that word place is singular not plural and the word principal requires us to pick out the main, prominent or leading place.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.149" offset="654043">But we also place considerable weight upon the practical need for administrative simplicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.890" offset="681002">Many of the lower court tests complicate the case, eating up time and money as the parties litigate not the merits of their claims but which court is the right court to decide those merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.255" offset="734396">We’ve recognized that there maybe no perfect test that satisfies all administrative and purposive criteria, but we believe a nerve center approach will point courts in the right direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.826" offset="784760">It will provide a test that is easier to apply most of the time perhaps not all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.542" offset="811614">Though it will indeed sometimes produce counterintuitive results because the Ninth Circuit approached the jurisdictional problem before us differ.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.781" offset="856545">We vacate its judgment and we remand the case for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.074" offset="873681">Our decision is unanimous.</text>
