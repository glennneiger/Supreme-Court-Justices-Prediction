            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">In case 08-1371 Christian Legal Society versus Martinez.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.247" offset="131469">Justice Ginsburg has the opinion of the Court.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="12.499" offset="156442">This case presents a novel First Amendment question, may a public law school condition official recognition of a student group, on the group’s agreement to open membership to all students, who want to join.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.744" offset="229376">We hold that a law school may maintain such an open access policy to meet First Amendment measurement the school need not provide a religion based exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.578" offset="288726">Respondent Hastings College of Law is a state operated law school, part of the University of California system.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.875" offset="321954">Hastings extends official recognition to student groups through its “Registered Student Organization” or RSO program.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.113" offset="374930">Several benefits attend RSO status, prime advantages of RSO qualification in addition to access to school facilities and methods of communicating with students.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.962" offset="434280">There are subsidies for the organizations events.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.657" offset="457059">This funding comes from mandatory, student activities fees, imposed without exception, on all students.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.568" offset="492690">To gain recognition, RSO’s must agree to comply with Hastings Nondiscrimination Policy, that policy tracking California Law, bars discrimination on several bases including religion and sexual orientation.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.009" offset="566460">Hastings interprets the policy to require RSO’s to accept all-comers.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.003" offset="590493">For example, as the parties have stipulated to be true, a Democratic group cannot exclude students holding Republican political police.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.323" offset="635737">Hastings policy is not unique, other law schools, for example, Georgetown University Law Center adhere to similar all-comers policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.420" offset="684116">At the beginning of the 2004 academic year, petitioner Christian Legal Society or CLS sought to become an RSO at Hastings.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.754" offset="733435">CLS accepts as members only students who share the society’s religious beliefs and views about sexual conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.253" offset="771469">Because CLS does not welcome all-comers, Hastings refused to grant it, RSO status but allowed the society to engage in expressive activities on campus using CLS’s own resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.616" offset="836880">CLS filed suit contending that the First Amendment required Hastings to accept the society as an RSO.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.582" offset="872824">The District Court affirmed by the Court of Appeals granted summary judgment to Hastings.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.457" offset="900305">We affirm the Ninth Circuit's judgment relying on the party’s stipulation of the undisputed facts we hold that Hastings all-comers policy does not unconstitutionally inhibit CLS’s freedom of speech or expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.956" offset="978254">CLS asked us not to focus on Hastings’s all-comers policy but on the school's written Nondiscrimination Policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.085" offset="1022767">We decline to do so, CLS stipulated in no uncertain terms that Hastings embracive all-comers policy governs RSO’s because CLS is bound by that stipulation we consider only whether the all-comers policy complies with the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.716" offset="1121301">This Court's decisions regarding limited public-forums provides the framework for our analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.136" offset="1154947">A state creates such a forum when it confines use of its resources to certain groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.042" offset="1178561">State regulation of speech in a limited public forum must meet two conditions; it must be both reasonable in light of the forum’s purposes and viewpoint neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.072" offset="1234777">Hastings’s all-comers policy we are satisfied meets these criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.408" offset="1256093">First, the policy ensures that the educational and social opportunities afforded by RSOs are accessible to all students.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.295" offset="1295590">RSOs as I just noted, are eligible for financial assistance drawn from mandatory student activity fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.386" offset="1327982">The policy ensures that no Hastings student is forced to fund a group that would reject her as a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.826" offset="1361732">Second, the policy enables Hastings to police compliance with the written terms of its Nondiscrimination Policy, without inquiring into an RSO’s motivation for membership decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.410" offset="1420037">Third, the policy to the extent that it brings together individuals with diverse beliefs, encourages tolerance, cooperation and learning amongst students.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.476" offset="1472387">Fourth, the policy incorporates and advances the state-law antidiscrimination prescriptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.034" offset="1502584">Hastings’s policy is all the more creditworthy given the alternative channels open to CLS communication with students.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.616" offset="1536857">Hastings offered CLS access to school facilities to conduct meetings and to advertise its events.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.350" offset="1567890">CLS, in fact hosted a variety of activities the year after Hastings denied it recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.230" offset="1599342">Attendants at CLS events that year far from dwindling notably increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.407" offset="1624106">As to viewpoint neutrality, it is hard to imagine a more viewpoint neutral policy than one requiring all student groups to accept all-comers.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.620" offset="1680948">CLS ultimately contends that the all-comers policy is pretextual and selectively applied but the Courts below did not address CLS’s pretext claim and this Court is not a proper place to air the issue in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.198" offset="1771227">On remand, the Ninth Circuit may take up CLS’s pretext argument, if and to the extent that the argument was properly preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.749" offset="1817412">Finally, and of overarching importance, in mounting this lawsuit, CLS seeks not parity with other organizations but preferential exemption from Hastings’s all-comers policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.451" offset="1880210">The First Amendment shields CLS against state prohibition of its expressive activity, exclusionary as that activity may be but CLS, we hold enjoys no constitutional right to state support of its selectivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.891" offset="1958055">Justice Stevens and Kennedy have filed concurring opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.901" offset="1978013">Justice Alito has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Justices Scalia and Thomas join.</text>
