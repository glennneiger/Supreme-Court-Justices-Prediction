            <label>Mr. B. Eric Restuccia</label>
            <text syncTime="7.714" offset="136296">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This is really a case about the law of habeas corpus for this murder conviction that was obtained in the Michigan courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.209" offset="174226">The issue was whether the Michigan Supreme Court unreasonably applied clearly established Supreme Court precedent in rejecting Mr. Smith's claim that his jury was not drawn from a fair cross-section of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.656" offset="224068">The Michigan Supreme Court did not act unreasonably in concluding that there was no unconstitutional underrepresentation and that there was no systematic exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.639" offset="263983">This Court's decision in Duren did not require a different result on either point, and this Court should reverse the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.306" offset="302644">I think it's important to note that there are two prongs at issue: The fair and reasonable representation prong and the systematic exclusion prong.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.882" offset="332946">And it's also significant to understand that the disparities at issue here are relatively small, that the time period at issue runs from -- from April of 1993 to October of 1993, where there was information -- for those 6 months for which the processes at play were measured.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.968" offset="405253">And the percentage of African-Americans that appeared in the venires during that time period was -- they comprised 6 percent of the venires, where the jury-eligible population was 7.28 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.182" offset="454154">So your -- so there was a 1.28 percent absolute disparity during this 6-month time period.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.943" offset="481217">That can also be measured as an 18 percent comparative disparity.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.178" offset="498145">Now, if you compare that to the disparities that are issue -- at issue in Duren, they really are a magnitude of difference, that the disparities in Duren involve the exclusion of women in Missouri, where they comprised -- women comprised 54 percent of the population and only 14.5 percent of the venires over an 8-month period of time.</text>

            <text syncTime="119.730" offset="584349">The -- I don't know if this is relevant or how to use it, but years ago, I took a course in this kind of thing at the Kennedy School.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.994" offset="617368">I was teaching, and they said the only way you could figure out what -- what's what here is you use something called 1,000 balls, and 60 of them are red, and 940 are black, and then you select them at random, and -- and 12 at a time.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.468" offset="703258">You know, fill 12 -- fill a hundred with 12 in each.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.324" offset="718723">And when we tried to do that, just for the interest of it, I -- I found that you would expect, with these numbers, something like a third to a half of juries would have at least one black person on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.896" offset="772953">Now, that may be wrong, because I am not a mathematician, but -- but putting that together, it looks as if there is a pretty big disparity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3482.884" offset="14036992">They could send three letters; they could explain in the letters why it's important to come; they could try reversing the thing a little bit with the districts first or not first -- all kinds of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.474" offset="14083281">But what -- but now you're forcing them into this legal rubric.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.315" offset="14098641">So what about a decision, which you wouldn't like, probably, but it would say we can't say that they're unreasonable in respect to not having all of these, but there -- who knows?</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.920" offset="14145139">You know, when they get around and others try them, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.887" offset="14156946">In other words, unreasonable/reasonable is one standard, and ambiguity plays a -- a role here, too, that might be helpful.</text>

            <text syncTime="3520.261" offset="14186412">Well, you are certainly correct, and I would simply say that the people of Grand Rapids looked up at the juries; 98 percent of the time they saw nothing but white faces.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.286" offset="14238553">I think that Duren requires that the local system do something about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3550.109" offset="14305844">I just have two brief points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.309" offset="14318696">One is that -- I want to just remind the Court that this is a case under AEDPA review, so that the Michigan Supreme Court has to be not just incorrect; it has to be objectively unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.008" offset="14365403">And its conclusion, I think probably the easiest analysis here is the conclusion that there was no showing of systemic exclusion, because Mr. Smith failed to show that there was any underrepresentation that arose from the jury assignment process, is probably one of the strongest points, because if you look at the 3 percent comparative disparity, that's less than half of 1 percent absolute disparity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.513" offset="14463519">No one claims that that's statistically significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.512" offset="14475431">So I think whether it's reviewed under 2254(d)(2) or 2254(e)(1), this Court should reverse.</text>
