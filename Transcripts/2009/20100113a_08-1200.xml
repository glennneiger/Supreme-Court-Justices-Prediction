            <text syncTime="7.670" offset="136088">Mr. Russell.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kevin K. Russell</label>
            <text syncTime="8.637" offset="139954">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.206" offset="150194">Congress rarely makes ignorance of the law a defense to civil liability, and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act is no exception to that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.462" offset="179242">While it may seem unfair to hold defendants in some sense strictly liable for legal mistakes in the civil context, the accumulated wisdoms of generations of legal practice has been that attempting to fix that unfairness through a mistake of law defense causes more harm than it prevents.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.737" offset="244339">And as a consequence, in light of that subtle understanding, courts should not read a Federal statute to establish a mistake of law defense, unless Congress quite plainly makes that intent to do so clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.445" offset="291150">And in this case, nothing in the text, structure, or the history of the bona fide error provision of the FDCPA indicates such an intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.468" offset="323333">I could begin with the -- the text of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.670" offset="336081">It is not enough under the bona fide error provision that the defendant's violation be in good faith, that it have been bona fide.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.324" offset="362726">There is an additional element, that the defendant has to show that the violation was not intentional.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.478" offset="383310">And in common legal discourse, a violation is not rendered unintentional simply because the defendant misunderstood the legal consequences of its actions.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="78.231" offset="418314">I think -- reading "intentional" the way you just articulated is absolutely right, but when you add -- I don't see what work "bona fide error" does in the statute, if "intentional" should be read in this case to mean what you say.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Kevin K. Russell</label>
            <text syncTime="92.805" offset="476620">Well, I think it captures the circumstance in which somebody makes a mistake of fact, but does so and with -- not in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.395" offset="510997">I think--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="102.513" offset="515490">But you say: Well, intentional means you meant to send out the document; you meant to serve it; in other words, no specific intent requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.501" offset="543389">But if -- a bona fide error, it seems, doesn't make the activity not intentional under the traditional understanding of intentional.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kevin K. Russell</label>
            <text syncTime="118.539" offset="579542">--But I think that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.158" offset="586021">I think both provisions do separate work, and so that if all it took to show that something wasn't intentional is that you didn't mean to violate the law, it would be very difficult to understand what work "bona fide" was doing in that circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.049" offset="641609">And I think Congress included the bona fide requirement in order to capture instances in which people make factual mistakes, but not in good faith.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="144.023" stopTime="174.559">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="144.023" offset="681524">I really don't think that the -- the word that we're wrestling with here is the -- the word "intentional".</text>
            <text syncTime="151.610" offset="711826">It seems to me it's the word "violation", because violation -- when it says the violation was intentional or unintentional, does "violation" mean the act that constitutes a violation of the law, or does "violation" mean the -- the fact of violating the law?</text>

            <text syncTime="174.559" offset="803673">I think that is the central question here and it is Respondents' best argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.495" offset="819451">I think that the word "violation" is best understood to refer to the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.064" offset="837632">That is how this Court has construed that word in the statutory phrase "knowing violation" in a number of cases, and that's how the courts of appeals have construed the term "intentional" -- or "intentional violation" in the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Workers Protection Act, which we cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.574" offset="899699">I did mention in our brief that it is a less usual formulation, "intentional violation", and at the time we wrote our briefs we weren't able to find any cases from this Court construing that particular term.</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="209.132" offset="941913">So what -- the part that's worrying me most is where the lawyer is the debt collector.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.350" offset="958840">All right?</text>
            <text syncTime="214.200" offset="962184">So he's within the act, and he has a client of debt collectors, and the clients all say: Please go collect the debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.104" offset="989874">And they say: We want to do this, like in this -- suppose in this case, they say: Tell us if you don't owe it; ask them to write a letter to that effect; we won't collect it; now, is that legal?</text>
            <text syncTime="232.645" offset="1035954">And the lawyer looks up everything in sight and says, yes, it's legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.929" offset="1049119">And then that's what he thinks.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.296" offset="1058628">All the circuits have said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.812" offset="1064688">And then he asks the FTC and they say, yes, it's legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.598" offset="1079839">So there he is.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.366" offset="1086840">Everybody's told him it's legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.699" offset="1092169">And lo and behold, this Court, surprisingly, holds the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.234" offset="1106380">Well, he shouldn't be liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.520" offset="1115470">And if he has to worry about that, he can never defend his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.138" offset="1129994">The only answer is: Whatever the man says who is opposed to your client, that's what you have to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.090" offset="1149743">That can't be the meaning of this statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="268.112" offset="1177851">If we're talking -- well, first of all, if we are talking about a case in which they've asked the opinion of the FTC, they are entitled to the safe harbor defense, because Congress specifically--</text>

            <text syncTime="278.918" offset="1221110">Well, in that circumstance, I think it's important to distinguish between lawyers who are simply giving advice to debt collector clients -- they're not covered by the act.</text>

            <text syncTime="954.795" offset="3924574">Well, I -- I would not say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.147" offset="3930008">I would say that Congress wrote this statute, in a way, to encourage private enforcement, to be sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.699" offset="3948189">It enacted statutory damages and fee shifting because it understood that this was an industry in which there was a particular risk of very aggressive and harmful practices, in part because debt collectors don't rely on the good will of the consumers they deal with in order to prosper.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.494" offset="4011405">And so all of the economic incentives in the industry push people to aggressive practices, and Congress wanted this statute to be a counterweight to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.916" offset="4045051">And as in many circumstances, Congress enacts statutory language and puts up requirements and holds people to them civilly because the -- the general rule in our legal system is that the risk and the cost of a legal mistake is generally allocated to the lawbreaker in the civil context and not to the people's whose rights have been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.246" offset="4134390">And there is no reason to think that Congress was acting particularly differently here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.364" offset="4154870">We were speaking earlier on about the words "intentional violation", and I wanted to bring to the Court's attention the fact that after we filed our brief, and in fact, last night, we -- we did find a case in which this Court construed that term, and we notified Respondents' counsel and the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.141" offset="4214011">And I just want to give you the cite so you can look at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.824" offset="4224669">It's Ellis v. United States, 206 U.S. 246.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.958" offset="4241283">The relevant passage is at page 257.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.641" offset="4251941">It's a 1907 opinion from Justice Holmes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.426" offset="4263121">And it's consistent with the way that the Court has construed the phrase "knowing violation" in a number of contexts, including in -- in the criminal context, where it's much more common for Congress to make a mistake of law a defense to liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.336" offset="4318814">I mentioned before that that kind of history of the development of the statute -- I think it's also worth noting, Justice Breyer, that at the time, Congress withdrew the attorney exemption from the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.328" offset="4366775">It was the uniform opinion of the courts of appeals at that time and all the district courts that the language of the bona fide error defense did not create a mistake of law defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.266" offset="4402510">And again, Congress had no reason to expect that in subjecting the attorneys to that statutory regime, that the bona fide error provision would be the solution to any special problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.638" offset="4443993">And Congress has also shown itself to be attentive to this special area of concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.756" offset="4460398">In 2006, it made a tailored adjustment to the statute to make clear that pleadings are not an initial communication triggering the validation notice requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.696" offset="4500208">And I think that demonstrates that Congress is -- is on top of this issue, and it stands at the ready to make adjustments that are necessary to make this legal system operate in a way that both makes sense, but nonetheless gives effect to their intent to treat attorney debt collectors on a par with regular debt collectors who are not attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.875" offset="4580874">I should also mention, Justice Breyer, to the extent there are some really intractable problems with respect to the act application to attorneys, there -- there is ongoing litigation in the lower courts about the Noerr-Pennington doctrine about how the constitutional implications of regulating in-court activity apply to the Court's interpretation of the statutory provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.241" offset="4674393">And again, I think it's more likely that that is the solution Congress would have intended, an interpretive solution--</text>

            <label>Mr. William M. Jay</label>
            <text syncTime="1232.878" offset="5036972">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.644" offset="5043973">I would like, if I may, to pick up with a point that Mr. Russell made, which is that the FDCPA is of a piece with most civil regulatory statutes, in that it makes knowledge of the law an aggravating factor and subjects violators who know that they are violating a law subject to substantial civil penalties of up to $16,000 per day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.606" offset="5115862">But it doesn't completely excuse violations based on a lack of knowledge of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.244" offset="5134357">In order to be excused, the violation must have resulted from a bona fide error and meet all three elements of the bona fide error defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.831" offset="5160793">We think that two of those elements are not satisfied by the Respondents' error in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.116" offset="5177929">First, legal errors, for the reason Mr. Russell explained, aren't unintentional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.603" offset="5199872">Justice Scalia asked about whether the phrase "the violation is not intentional" is a signal in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.192" offset="5230174">We think that the work that that phrase, "the violation was not intentional", does in this circumstance is to show that the portion of the debt collector's conduct that triggers the violation of the statute, it was -- is what must be unintentional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.433" offset="5283150">Let me illustrate that with an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.135" offset="5289942">Under the statute, a debt collector who places a call to a debtor at home after 9:00 at night may well violate the statute; likely does violate the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.825" offset="5328708">So what must be unintentional for that debt collector to make out the bona fide error defense is not that the telephone call had been -- had been placed unintentionally, but rather that the debt collector didn't have knowledge, for example, because of an error about what time zone the debtor lives in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.417" offset="5387118">The -- the debt collector didn't know that the call was being placed after 9:00 at night.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.154" offset="5410001">That is an unintentional error, and it is excused under the statute if the debt collector can also show that it maintains procedures reasonably adapted to prevent any such errors--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="1335.827" offset="5448767">And your example of that couldn't happen, because if you were calling debtors, you should certainly check what time of evening the call is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.016" offset="5489518">So you get over the first problem, but then on the second problem, the second -- how could that possibly be careful procedure, if you don't even check to see what time zone the person is in?</text>

            <text syncTime="1359.173" offset="5542076">--Well, I think, Justice Ginsburg, if -- if you check, but due to a keyboarding error, for example, Arizona is entered as Alabama or an error in time zone is entered in whatever record is being consulting by the debt collector, that's the kind of factual error, a clerical, bookkeeping type error that -- that Congress had in mind when it created this defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.654" offset="5620025">And it bears repeating that Congress has created this -- this defense in identical terms in a number of other statutes; federal agencies have construed the identical language in a number of other statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.360" offset="5658896">And never has Congress or a federal agency contemplated that one of these defenses would, in fact, encompass legal errors.</text>

            <text syncTime="1395.215" offset="5686272">Do you know why when Congress codified that law errors don't count, codified that for the Truth in Lending Act purposes, it didn't make the corresponding change in the others?</text>

            <text syncTime="1409.439" offset="5743219">We don't have a specific indication, Justice Ginsburg, why it didn't go back and revise every other statute that -- that already had such a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.945" offset="5777178">But I think that the answer is simply that Congress was revising the Truth in Lending Act in a statute called the Truth in Lending Simplification Act, and the -- the statute in which that was passed didn't make any other -- any other changes to non-financial statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.705" offset="5836215">It didn't reopen the Federal -- Fair Debt Collection Practice Act in any other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.406" offset="5851052">In fact, the relevant portion of the FDCPA, Section 1692k, hasn't been amended in any way since Congress first enacted it in 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.095" offset="5885848">So we think that the relevance of the 1980 amendment to TILA is simply this: It's part of a consistent pattern by Congress and by the agencies such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Federal Reserve Board that interpret statutes with identical or very similar bona fide error provisions to say: Errors of law are not what Congress or the agency had in mind.</text>

            <text syncTime="1491.640" offset="6071944">Now, of course, this statute has a very short statute of limitations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1753.231" offset="7118305">We don't think that's at all inconsistent with what Congress intended, and we do think that Congress intended that this be the primary avenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.218" offset="7146308">And if you look at the advisory opinion provision of the Truth in Lending Act, we think that illustrates it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.272" offset="7166474">At the time Congress enacted the FDCPA, the Truth in Lending Act advisory opinion provision had only been on the books for a couple of years, but it had already filled more than 100 pages of the Code of Federal Regulations with advisory opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.329" offset="7214749">And we think that that's how Congress intended for the law under this statute to be clarified as well, not in a way that effectively confers qualified immunity on debt collectors whenever there is an ambiguity in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.220" offset="7262292">We think that that is reinforced as well by a substantive aspect of the statute, which is that Congress recognized -- and this is in particular in the legislative history at page 18 in footnote 9 of our brief -- that the debt collection industry is extremely aggressive and looks for loopholes whenever they exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.497" offset="7323418">So the substantive prohibitions of the statute, especially 1692d, e, and f, are written in such a way that they contain broad, substantive prohibitions that are illustrated by examples, but those examples expressly are illustrative and not exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.573" offset="7379738">Congress would not have wanted a debt collector to be able to say: Well, gee, this -- this practice is not expressly addressed by the statute and has not yet expressly been addressed by any judicial opinion, and to say: Well, that law is not clearly established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.683" offset="7440133">We think it's -- may I finish the sentence Mr. Chief Justice?</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.049" offset="7449642">We think, instead, that Congress would have recognized that the purpose of this statute is to protect the unsophisticated debtor, and that the sophisticated repeat players of the debt collection industry, if they want to clarify the law, should go to the FTC.</text>
