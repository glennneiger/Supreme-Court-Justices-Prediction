            <text syncTime="2248.743" offset="9100372">This was the era, Justice Alito, in which Enron and WorldCom exposed to the world the complexity of vast and difficult-to-ascertain frauds, and Congress was seeking to extend that period so that investors would have an opportunity responsibly to bring cases that would ferret out that fraud and to get at all of the people who might have participated in that fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.894" offset="9204966">That was the explanation that the -- the Senate gave for that, and that couples with the action by Congress in the PSLRA, which was intended to ensure that these pleading standards would be well investigated and well ferreted out prior to pleadings.</text>

            <text syncTime="2737.379" offset="11054958">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: By its terms, section 1658(b)(1) provides that the 2-year period of limitations will commence to run upon discovery of the facts constituting the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.869" offset="11108874">In isolation, the word "discovery" could refer either to actual or constructive discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.590" offset="11127787">Between the period of the time of this Court's decision in Lampf and the enactment of the new limitations period in 2002, all of the courts of appeals had concluded that constructive discovery would suffice, and we believe that Congress's enactment of the statute tracking that language constitutes acquiescence in that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.052" offset="11197586">Nevertheless, it's noteworthy that the statute refers to facts constituting the violation, and it's absolutely essential to this Court's section 10(b) jurisprudence that can there be no 10(b) violation without scienter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.459" offset="11251294">Scienter is an essential element of the offense, and the coverage of section 10(b) would be dramatically expanded if it were read to cover innocent mistakes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2794.631" offset="11283895">Was there also a substantial support in the lower court case law prior to the enactment of this provision for the existence of inquiry notice?</text>

            <text syncTime="2807.123" offset="11333945">There were certainly frequent references to the concept of inquiry notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.093" offset="11349828">There was not uniformity among the courts of appeals as to precisely what role inquiry notice would play in the analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.914" offset="11381070">The majority of the courts of appeals believed as we believe that inquiry notice is a subsidiary step along the way to determining when a reasonable plaintiff would have actually discovered the facts constituting the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.923" offset="11433106">And so you look first to see when would a reasonable person have become suspicious, and then you ask: Once the reasonable person's suspicions were aroused, how long would it take to complete the investigation and have actual knowledge?</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.914" offset="11485038">And that's consistent with our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.264" offset="11490471">There certainly were courts that adopted Petitioners' view that the statute began to run at the time of inquiry notice, at the time suspicions were aroused--</text>

            <text syncTime="2855.004" offset="11525475">But, under your position, as -- the concept of inquiry notice becomes essentially very unimportant, if not completely meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.860" offset="11560897">You just ask at what point would a reasonably diligent investor have obtained knowledge of the necessary facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.529" offset="11591513">And so, what difference does it make when a person was put on inquiry notice?</text>

            <text syncTime="2876.500" offset="11611470">--Well, I think it is -- I think you are right that that is the ultimate question for the Court: When would a reasonably diligent person have obtained actual knowledge?</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.170" offset="11642086">The concept of inquiry notice can be a useful subsidiary step, because even once it has been established -- for instance, there are many cases of this Court in which the plaintiff's failure to exercise reasonable diligence consisted of the failure to look at documents that were available in public records offices or corporate records that were open for inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.269" offset="11730484">And in that situation, once you identify the point at which a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have commenced to look, there won't be a very long gap in time before the reasonably diligent plaintiff would have found what he was looking for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.160" offset="11782102">And in that situation, it's really integral to identify the point of inquiry notice, the point at which the plaintiff would have started looking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.314" offset="11810628">Now, the fact that inquiry notice is not the be-all and end-all shouldn't be surprising, because it's a term that doesn't appear in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.670" offset="11840094">And so the fact that it ultimately plays a subsidiary role in undertaking the ultimate--</text>

            <text syncTime="3200.150" offset="12905994">But the Tellabs Court was talking about something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.416" offset="12915085">It was construing the heightened pleading requirements of the PSLRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.304" offset="12930654">Now, the PSLRA pleading requirements do distinguish, in adjacent subsections, between the requirement that a plaintiff plead with particularity the specific statements that are alleged to be false or misleading and the reason that they are false and misleading, on the one hand -- that's in subsection (1) -- and then, in subsection (2), it requires also to be pleaded with particularity the facts that establish strong inference of scienter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.019" offset="13033472">And the Court in Tellabs used the term (1); namely, you have to plead with particularity facts about the alleged misstatement and why it's misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.612" offset="13087911">The statute itself, the PSLRA, does not use the term "facts constituting the violation" to describe the first category.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.099" offset="13117795">And the word 10(b) naturally encompasses both what the defendant did and what his state of mind was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.355" offset="13150814">The other thing we would say -- two other things we would say in that regard are, first, as the introductory language of section 1658(b) points out, this limitations period only applies to suits in which the plaintiff alleges misconduct involving fraud, deceit, manipulation, or contrivance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.268" offset="13230540">And so, the limitations period is limited to violations that have scienter as an element.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.106" offset="13253841">And, therefore, it would be particularly peculiar to think of a violation as not encompassing the fact of scienter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.160" offset="13282053">The other thing we would say -- and Justice Scalia was asking earlier about the differences between 78i(e) and 77m -- and there are really too salient differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.766" offset="13320505">The first is that 77m is explicit in providing that constructive as well as actual discovery will suffice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.436" offset="13351121">And we think that 1658(b)(1) is properly read to encompass constructive discovery, even though it doesn't say so in so many words.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.441" offset="13379229">But the other salient difference is that the period in 77m doesn't commence to run by its terms upon discovery of the violation or the facts constituting the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.714" offset="13420293">The statute says discovery of the false or misleading statement or omission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.968" offset="13441296">That's natural in 77m, because 77m deals with violations that don't have scienter as an element.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.724" offset="13472329">But if this Court had incorporated that language, it would have given the impression that knowledge of scienter was not sufficient -- was not required.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kannon K. Shanmugam</label>
            <text syncTime="3354.032" offset="13521544">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.500" offset="13531470">A narrow issue before the Court in this case is whether a plaintiff must possess information specifically relating to scienter in order to be on inquiry notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.356" offset="13566892">And really under any standard for inquiry notice, there was abundant information in the public domain as of 2001 at least suggesting the possibility that Petitioners in this case had engaged in securities fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.163" offset="13614122">Now, my brothers don't really dispute that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.013" offset="13625511">Instead, they really advance two other options for interpreting section 1658(b), under which the concept of inquiry notice, the well-established concept of inquiry notice, really has no role.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.221" offset="13670337">My friend Mr. Frederick suggested, at least in cases involving alleged fraud on the market, that the standard really should be an actual discovery standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.676" offset="13708163">But no court of appeals has adopted that interpretation of section 1658(b), and as a practical matter that would dramatically lengthen the limitations period for private securities fraud actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.884" offset="13748914">And it is no answer to say that Congress's inclusion of a statute of repose makes everything okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.304" offset="13774618">We would respectfully submit that the inclusion of the statute of repose suggests that Congress was simply particularly concerned with the inclusion -- with the fact that plaintiffs could bring stale claims, and that Congress in no way intended to modify the traditional operation of the discovery rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.480" offset="13839297">With regard to the suggestion that the Court should simply adopt a constructive discovery rule that pays no heed to inquiry notice, which is the standard that the government seems to be advancing, I think, first of all, Respondents' difficulty in coming up with a date on which constructive discovery occurs in this case simply illustrates the problem that would be multiplied a hundredfold if that standard is applied nationwide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.262" offset="13934488">And where a statute of limitations is concerned, one needs to have clear rules and rules that courts can easily apply without inconsistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.535" offset="13967611">I do think that that rule would also lead to abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.135" offset="13977955">It would lead to the abuse of the ostrich plaintiff who simply lies in wait and waits to see how a company's stock performs before bringing suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.741" offset="14008362">And make no mistake about it: That is what precisely happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.443" offset="14023199">By counsel for Respondents' own admission in the district court, the filing of the lawsuit in 2003, before the withdrawal of Vioxx from the market, was triggered by a disappointing earnings report that led to a decline in the stock price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.352" offset="14074817">And one can expect that that phenomenon will be multiplied if such a hypothetical plaintiff inquiry is adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.672" offset="14100104">In this case, there was abundant information in the public domain by virtue of the FDA warning letter and other sources as of 2001.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.993" offset="14129361">The plaintiffs in this case conducted no investigation at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.814" offset="14144721">And this Court's cases--</text>

            <text syncTime="3515.282" offset="14166559">--The plaintiff may not have suffered an injury by that point, but it is clear that section 1658(b) refers to the facts constituting a violation of section 10(b), not all of the elements of a private cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.773" offset="14224551">So Congress itself contemplated the possibility that the limitations period could begin to run before the loss occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.177" offset="14250151">And if I can just say one thing about this Court's cases concerning the discovery rule, I respectfully disagree with my friend Mr. Frederick.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.830" offset="14276692">This Court's cases make clear that a plaintiff must exercise reasonable diligence in order to take advantage of the discovery rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.917" offset="14305113">Indeed, recently in Klehr in the context of civil RICO, this Court held that a plaintiff must exercise reasonable diligence even to invoke the doctrine of fraudulent concealment--</text>
