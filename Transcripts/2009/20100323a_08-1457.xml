            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="222.736" offset="996352">But here the court of appeals said that the Act does two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.123" offset="1021952">First, it said that the full board can delegate full powers to any three-member group.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.603" offset="1059882">That was step one, and that was done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.244" offset="1070435">And then it says there's this rule that a quorum is three, but then it said: Except as to one of these three-member groups that has been designated, except, and there the quorum is two.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.411" offset="1135114">So why doesn't the statute answer the question that, yes, a quorum is three, except when it's two?</text>

            <label>Mr. Sheldon E. Richie</label>
            <text syncTime="266.843" offset="1172835">Well, I think there is two answers to that, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.888" offset="1184956">One is here the government -- the board takes the position, as they say on page 29 in a footnote to their brief, that when a delegate group possessed of all of the board's power acts, it is acting as the board and not as an agent of the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.101" offset="1265831">So first, we would say that the second quorum provision isn't even applicable to this group that was established -- of members Kirsanow, Liebman and Schaumber.</text>

            <text syncTime="1670.242" offset="6786341">First, section 153(b) permits delegation of any or all of the board's power to three or more members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.441" offset="6815180">Second, that section sets out a general quorum rule of three members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.440" offset="6835137">And third, as Justices Alito -- Justices Alito, Kennedy and Ginsburg have pointed out, there is the phrase "except that" in the rule, a special quorum provision that sets up panel quorums at two members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.464" offset="6887278">And in this case, faced with a vacancy crisis, the board validly delegated its powers in December 2007 to a three-member panel, and Petitioners have never contested otherwise.</text>

            <text syncTime="1717.829" offset="6976721">So knowing when it gave it to this three member panel that it would shortly become a two-member panel, and that thereby the board would be able to act with only two members instead of with three, which is what the quorum requirement for the board is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.996" offset="7033354">I must say that seems to be a very strange procedure when you have a statute that says the board has to -- has to have three for a quorum.</text>

            <text syncTime="3227.457" offset="13015291">And they said -- I'm reading from the appendix page 89 of our petition: The board forum requirement therefore must be satisfied regardless of whether the board's authority is delegated to a group of its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.028" offset="13065550">A modifying phrase such as -- as this, talking about the "at all times three members" denotes that there is no instance in which the board forum requirement may be disregarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.931" offset="13117168">And then the court said:</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.600" offset="13123856">"It therefore defies logic as well as the text of the statute to argue as the board does that a Congress which explicitly imposed a requirement for a three-member quorum at all times would in the same sentence allow the board to reduce its operative quorum to two without further congressional authorization.
