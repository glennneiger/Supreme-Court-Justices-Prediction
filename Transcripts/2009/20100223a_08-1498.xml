            <text syncTime="8.919" offset="142127">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This as-applied challenge asks whether the government can make it a crime for Ralph Fertig and the Humanitarian Law Project to speak in association with the Kurdistan Workers Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.896" offset="202000">Specifically, they seek to advocate for legal reform in Congress and the UN, to write and distribute articles supportive of Kurdish rights, to inform the Kurds of their international human rights and remedies, and to advise them on peaceful conflict resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.965" offset="286323">It is undisputed that the Kurdistan Workers Party engages in a wide range of lawful activities and that plaintiffs seek to support only lawful ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.882" offset="325925">The government has a concededly compelling interest in combatting terrorism, yet it has not even tried to defend these prohibitions under strict scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.050" offset="370646">Instead, it rests its entire case on the proposition that criminalizing plaintiffs' speech is a regulation of conduct, not speech, and therefore can be upheld under O'Brien.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.700" offset="421219">That view is mistaken for two fundamental reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.603" offset="436893">First, as this Court has already held, O'Brien is inapplicable where the government prohibits pure speech--</text>
