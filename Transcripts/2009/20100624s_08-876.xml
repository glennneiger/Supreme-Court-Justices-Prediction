            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">I next announce the decision in Number 08-876, Black versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.867" offset="133872">As In Skilling the defendants in this case were charged with fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.597" offset="148814">At trial the Government pursued alternative theories, money or property fraud and honest-services-fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.340" offset="183818">The government sought to pinpoint the theory or theories on which the jury relied in the event of a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.228" offset="211404">To that purpose the government proposed special verdict forms asking the Jury to say whether the verdict rested on money or property fraud or honest-services-fraud or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.912" offset="262081">The defendants resisted and the government ultimately acquiesced in submitting the case to the jury for an unelaborated general verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.522" offset="300534">On appeal the defendants urged the invalidity of the honest-services-fraud instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.106" offset="326865">The Seventh Circuit found no infirmity in those instructions but went on to move that in any event the defendants had forfeited their objection to the instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.446" offset="372214">Defendants did show the Court of Appeal said by opposing the government proposed special verdict forms which would have revealed whether the jury found honest-services-fraud or only money or property fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.600" offset="428847">We reverse the Seventh Circuit's judgment under our decision today In Skilling; the honest-services instructions given to the Jury in this case were incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.594" offset="472837">By timely objecting to those instructions at trial, the defendants secure their right to challenge them on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.709" offset="505229">The defendants did not forfeit that right by declining to acquiesce in the government proposed special verdict forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.295" offset="535636">As In Skilling however, we leave for consideration on remand, the question whether the instructional error was ultimately harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.205" offset="571267">Justices Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.637" offset="600942">Justice Kennedy has also filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</text>
