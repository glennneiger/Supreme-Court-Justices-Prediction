            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="107520">We will hear argument first this term in Case 08-680, Maryland v. Shatzer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.919" offset="131135">General Gansler.</text>

          <turn speaker="douglas_f_gansler" startTime="7.027" stopTime="52.242">
            <label>Mr. Douglas F. Gansler</label>
            <text syncTime="7.027" offset="135628">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="9.698" offset="146286">This case is here from the Maryland Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.042" offset="155585">In that case, the court of appeals suppressed a statement that was given by Respondent following what the trial court found to be a valid waiver of his Miranda rights and following a free and voluntary confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.017" offset="211487">The reason why the court did so is because, two years and seven months prior to that, the defendant was in a different custodial interrogation and at that time invoked his right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.000" offset="251507">We ask that this Court reverse the Maryland Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.155" offset="264046">It is our position that a break in custody from custodial interrogation should be the bright line that this Court adopts in order to end the irrebuttable presumption that this Court created in the Edwards case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="52.242" stopTime="56.867">
            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="52.242" offset="316395">Without regard to the time?</text>
            <text syncTime="53.556" offset="321724">A break in custody of one day, do you think that should be enough?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="douglas_f_gansler" startTime="56.867" stopTime="87.307">
            <label>Mr. Douglas F. Gansler</label>
            <text syncTime="56.867" offset="334890">Your Honor, we do think one day should be enough, as long as it is not in the pretrial detention category.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.786" offset="358609">Obviously, the three cases that have come before this Court, Edwards, Minnick and, Roberson, all -- two of them were three days, and one of them was one day, but those defendants were in the pretrial detention status.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.985" offset="403435">So if in fact a defendant is brought in, questioned, and then released back to his or her daily routine, and away from the isolation of the custodial interrogation, we feel that that should be the bright line for a break in custody.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="87.307" stopTime="101.626">
            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="87.307" offset="456725">So what if it's repeatedly done?</text>
            <text syncTime="88.698" offset="462263">You know, you -- you bring him in, you give him his Miranda rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.143" offset="492042">He says, I don't want to talk.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.084" offset="491938">You let him go.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.676" offset="491833">You bring him in, give him his Miranda rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.892" offset="495073">You know, just sort of catch and release, until he finally breaks down and says, All right, I'll talk.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="douglas_f_gansler" startTime="101.626" stopTime="166.428">
            <label>Mr. Douglas F. Gansler</label>
            <text syncTime="101.626" offset="513985">There is parade of horribles of catch and release and Your Honor just went through one of them, and there are obviously a number of hypotheticals that one could posit.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.139" offset="548049">We would suggest that the break of custody would be the end of the Edwards irrebuttable presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.871" offset="570932">However, there are still three responses to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.056" offset="583680">The first would be the defendant could still say that his or her Miranda rights were not given voluntarily and willfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.475" offset="617326">Secondly, the due process jurisprudence that this Court had prior to Miranda still is in existence, and therefore the defendant could argue that that confession was given in an overborne way, that his will was overborne.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.065" offset="663719">But finally and I think most relevant, because this is sort of the other side of this case, is that there has been -- since 1982 eight Federal circuits and over 20 States have had the break of custody rule in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.120" offset="719935">And in fact this Court in the McNeil case, albeit in dicta and parenthetically, assumed a break in custody as the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.962" offset="747311">There has not been one published opinion, at least that we could find, that has this -- that has that scenario--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="166.428" stopTime="175.252">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="166.428" offset="773224">Is the rationale for the break in custody that there is a likelihood of non-coercion?</text>
            <text syncTime="172.113" offset="795899">Is that the reason that you offer for the rule?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="douglas_f_gansler" startTime="175.252" stopTime="184.389">
            <label>Mr. Douglas F. Gansler</label>
            <text syncTime="175.252" offset="808438">--Your Honor, it goes to -- yes, this Court has said, most recently again in Montejo, that the reason for Edwards is that we want to prevent badgering.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="184.389" stopTime="218.638">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="184.389" offset="845009">All right.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.763" offset="846472">But this person was in custody in the sense he was in prison and the brief said, oh, he was released to the general population.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.259" offset="872490">But the possibilities for coercion or pressure are very substantial in the prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.867" offset="902896">The warden comes in and says: Oh, your cell doesn't have a window.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.410" offset="913136">I mine, there's countless way in which a prisoner in the general prison population would consider that he is -- that there has been no break in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.218" offset="968307">I think that's a very difficult rule that you are proposing.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="douglas_f_gansler" startTime="218.638" stopTime="291.320">
            <label>Mr. Douglas F. Gansler</label>
            <text syncTime="218.638" offset="981995">Well, the courts -- the lower courts have shown that there is a difference between police interrogational custody and correctional custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.383" offset="1013029">What we are suggesting is once the person -- in our case, for example, in the second interview, the defendant was in what's called -- what's called a maintenance room in the room, with a metal table and the two chairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.862" offset="1058900">It was clearly an interrogation context.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.436" offset="1069244">When that person is released from that, some people are habitual criminals and they're put back into the general population amongst -- that's where they live for that time period.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.653" offset="1110100">Other people go home.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.947" offset="1115220">But the break in custody for Edwards purposes ought to end at the end of the interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.488" offset="1137371">Now, could there be an interrogational situation while the person's in prison?</text>
            <text syncTime="261.926" offset="1155135">Absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.847" offset="1158896">You can envision a correctional officer coming to the cafeteria when there's, the public is there, the public being other inmates, and that would not be deemed to be an interrogation atmosphere.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.717" offset="1202364">If, however, they cleared the cafeteria and had officers standing by the doors and blocking the doors and saying no one's allowed to come in here, that could then become interrogation custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.587" offset="1241861">And this Court and other courts, the courts all the time, have to decide in the Edwards context whether or not the defendant was in custody when the statement was given.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="291.320" stopTime="316.496">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="291.320" offset="1272790">But if the defendant goes home, he can contact a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.129" offset="1299958">In prison he can't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.846" offset="1314900">So, if the whole idea is to protect his right to counsel, then it makes a big difference whether he's at home or in prison.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="douglas_f_gansler" startTime="316.496" stopTime="357.105">
            <label>Mr. Douglas F. Gansler</label>
            <text syncTime="316.496" offset="1373414">Your Honor -- well, first of all, the defendant while they're in prison can contact a lawyer in some circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.524" offset="1397551">For example, during the two years and seven months between these two interrogations he could have written, he could have called.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.227" offset="1416359">But let's say that that was unavailable to that particular defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.709" offset="1430256">It's our position that what Edwards does, Miranda, Edwards, Roberson, Minnick, it provides the opportunity to consult counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.552" offset="1461708">But the -- what we are talking about here is the custodial interrogation situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.128" offset="1483964">In other words, the police don't have to get somebody a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.955" offset="1495249">Whether or not somebody has the opportunity to consult a lawyer or not, as long as they are provided with their Miranda rights, the Miranda rights themselves are the protection that the defendant has.</text>
