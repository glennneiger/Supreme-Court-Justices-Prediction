            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">Justice Kennedy has our opinion today in case 08-1553, Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha versus Beloit Corp. and the consolidated case.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="11.581" offset="151761">In these cases, cargo owners wanted to ship goods from China to the United States and the United States destinations where points in the Midwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.666" offset="188123">To arrange the shipment the cargo owners contracted with “K” Line.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.782" offset="204528">Now “K” Line operates ocean vessels and the documents the parties use for the shipment, documents they sign with “K” Line cover the shipment from China to the final delivery point in the United States and that’s why they are called through bills of lading.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.424" offset="263147">The bill of lading is for the entire journey.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.040" offset="273596">To complete the shipment in the United States, “K” Line subcontracted with Union Pacific Railroad Company, so after the “K” Line shipped the goods in one of its own vessels from the China to California, it then transferred the cargo to Union Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.152" offset="333991">Union Pacific began the rail segment of the shipment but the cargo was allegedly destroyed when the chained train derailed in Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.034" offset="365547">The cargo owners sued, they sued in a California Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.717" offset="380280">“K” Line and Union Pacific said, well you can't bring the suit in California because there is a bill of lading and the bill of lading says that through the bill of lading says that you must sue in Japan.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.039" offset="425524">The United States District Court for the Central District of California ruled for “K” Line and the Union Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.888" offset="444959">It held the suit had to be dismissed because the Tokyo, Japan, forum selection clause was enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.789" offset="472545">The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.227" offset="486337">It concluded that a Federal statute which is known as the Carmack Amendment, applicable to railroads applies to the domestic inland leg of an international shipment under a through bill of lading and the Carmack Amendment would override the Tokyo forum-selection clause that’s because Carmack specifies that suits must be brought in specific locations in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.747" offset="572437">So the question is whether the Carmack Amendment does apply to the domestic inland leg of this shipment?</text>
            <text syncTime="123.074" offset="597723">We conclude that it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.656" offset="608068">Carmack only applies if a rail carrier is required to issue its own bill of lading and Carmack only requires that a receiving rail carrier issue their own bills of lading.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.306" offset="650595">All that means is, all this means is the we have to decide whether Union Pacific was a receiving carrier and we hold that it was not, that is because the cargo had been first delivered to “K” Line and it was not a rail carrier covered by Carmack.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.666" offset="712035">If Carmack’s bill of lading rules refer to any rail carrier that in the colloquial sense received the property from another carrier, then every carrier during the shipment would have to issue its own separate bill of lading.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.571" offset="759683">This would be altogether contrary to Carmack’s purpose of making the receiving and delivering carriers liable for any damages under single initial bill of lading.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.935" offset="805136">Indeed, this wouldn’t affect outlaw through shipments under single bill of lading in circumstances like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.523" offset="835542">Now whether text of a statute permits congressional enactment should be construed to be consistent with one another and the opinion points out that the interpretation of Carmack that the court now adopts, attains the most consistency between Carmack and a second Federal statute, the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, that statute is known as COGSA and COGSA applies of its own force only to ocean carriage but the statute explicitly states the parties can extend COGSA’s terms by contract, that is what the parties did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.480" offset="955392">COGSA unlike Carmack would allow the Tokyo forum-selection clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.367" offset="974932">The court gives practical reasons in support of its statutory construction and in some because the journey here included no receiving rail carrier that was required to issue bill of ladings under Carmack.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.874" offset="1024878">That statute does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.880" offset="1032923">The parties’ agreement to litigate these cases in Tokyo is binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.722" offset="1048283">The cargo owners must abide by the contracts they made.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.741" offset="1060404">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.072" offset="1069704">The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.384" offset="1082974">Justice Sotomayor has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Stevens and Ginsburg have joined.</text>
