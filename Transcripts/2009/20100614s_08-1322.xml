            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">Justice Thomas has our opinion this morning in case 08-1322, Astrue Vs Ratliff.</text>

            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="8.013" offset="137446">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.281" offset="166494">Petitioner Michael Astrue is United States Commissioner of Social Security.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.783" offset="188541">Respondent Catherine Ratliff is an attorney represented her client in a successful lawsuit against the Commission for Social Security benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.315" offset="230651">Because Ratliff's client prevailed under claim that the district court granted the unopposed motion Ratliff filed for award of attorney's fees under Section 204 (d) of the Equal Access to Justice Act or EAJA, codified at 28 U.S.C., Section 2412 (d). Before the government paid the fees award however, it discovered that Ratliff's client owed the United States a debt that predated the award.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.521" offset="367532">Accordingly the United States notified that district court, that it planned to exercise its statutory authority to withhold payment of the fees award as an offset against that debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.810" offset="428659">Ratliff intervened and objected to the proposed offset on the grounds that EAJA makes an attorney's fee award payable directly to the prevailing litigant's attorney and thus such awards cannot be offset to debts owed by the litigant to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.122" offset="521864">The district court rejected this argument, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that EAJA makes the attorney's fees, in this case, payable directly to Ratliff, the attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.647" offset="579960">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.221" offset="602321">The party's dispute is governed by Section 24 (d) (1) (A) of EAJA.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.079" offset="625727">That provision states in pertinent part that a court shall award to a prevailing party the attorney's fees at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.209" offset="666269">We have long held that the term prevailing party in attorney's fees statutes is a legal term of art that refers to the prevailing litigant not to the prevailing litigant's attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.270" offset="726455">We conclude that the term carries the same settled meaning in Section 2412 (d) (1) (A) of EAJA.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.790" offset="760623">We base this conclusion on the plain text of the statute and on our precedence and reject for the reasons set forth in our opinion, Ratliff's arguments that the Court of Appeals contrary judgment is supported by other provisions of EAJA along with certain provisions of the Social Security Act and the government's practice of paying fees awards directly to attorneys in some Social Security cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.584" offset="879741">Justice Sotomayor has filed the concurring opinion in which Justices Stevens and Ginsburg have joined.</text>
