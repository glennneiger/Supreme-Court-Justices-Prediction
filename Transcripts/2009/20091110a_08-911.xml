            <text syncTime="758.489" offset="3140357">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="761.874" offset="3153941">The statute at issue does not bar judicial review of denials of motions to reopen.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.160" offset="3171077">And I would like to go right to one of the questions that was asked by Justice Scalia, which is: How do you make sense out of this statute, in terms of what Congress is doing in not allowing judicial review of specifications of discretion in regulations, but -- I'm sorry, and allowing judicial review of things that are specified in regulations, but not things that are specified in the subchapter?</text>
            <text syncTime="785.307" offset="3247668">And I think that the answer to this question comes from the text of the statute, particularly if you compare the two things that are in 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) and (ii), that all of the things that are listed in (i) and that are covered by (ii) are subsumate decisions that are made by the Executive in the immigration context as a matter of grace, things that involve whether aliens can stay in the country or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.255" offset="3339515">And those are matters, at the end of the day, that the Executive, in the exercise of its immigration and foreign affairs power, has the authority to decide and that Congress did not want the Federal courts in the business of reviewing.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.628" offset="3384968">But what the Federal courts have often reviewed are things where discretion is committed by regulation, and these are procedural matters that relates to whether an alien had a fair shot of getting his claim heard by the agency and by the Federal courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2702.934" offset="10918160">The first is the Communications Act of 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.402" offset="10936027">This Court recognized in Global Crossing that the agency there could determine that a -- that conduct under the act was unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.360" offset="10979913">That is an administrative determination under one section of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.496" offset="10996423">It has the consequence under another section of the act of creating a cause of action for individuals to recover in damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.049" offset="11022649">The second example is actually section 701(a)(2) of the Administrative Procedure Act which refers to categories of decisions that are committed to agency discretion by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.690" offset="11065177">Courts have understood that that is not the broad subset of discretionary decisions but instead that subcategory of discretionary decision for which there is no law to apply, and many courts recognize that the agencies may create the law to apply in those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.187" offset="11147201">So an agency may enact a regulation that binds the agency's own discretion and renders the issue reviewable where it would not otherwise have been.</text>

            <text syncTime="3521.474" offset="14192347">Section 1252(b)(6) mandates that review of the underlying decision should be consolidated with review of a motion to reopen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.115" offset="14242920">I think that tells us several things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.865" offset="14249921">The first and foremost of which is Congress intended there to be review of motions to reopen -- at least some motions to reopen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.054" offset="14282627">To try to go back to Justice Breyer's questions, I think one can extrapolate from the consolidation provision that, if it is impossible to consolidate because there is no review of the underlying decision, you do not get to have a review of those motions to reopen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.800" offset="14365696">And that is referenced, I believe, in the government's brief, at footnote 15 -- excuse me, with some cases cited, where courts have so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.525" offset="14408537">We did not focus on that because that is not Mr. Kucana's issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.346" offset="14431838">As the court has alluded to, Mr. Kucana's issue is the nature of asylum based upon changed country conditions, and those situations are where it may be a matter of life and death, certainly, also a matter of -- of liberty, to be able to bring forward new evidence, which did not exist before, about changed country conditions, and it is not two bites at the apple.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.342" offset="14523789">It's the first bite at current conditions, which is essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.579" offset="14540716">With regard to the case of Webster v. Doe, that my colleague cited orally, that was an extremely unusual case in which the Court essentially said that it could not -- it did not have any criteria to evaluate the discretion used by the director of the CIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.677" offset="14629115">That is certainly not the situation we have here, where we are dealing with motions to reopen, which are analogous to Rule 60 (b) and which are routinely reviewed on abuse of discretion standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.336" offset="14679792">Additionally, let me note that, if you were to determine that the statutory language "specified under" is ambiguous that the applicable canons both point us to favoring judicial review, favoring judicial -- favoring judicial review and not essentially allowing the executive to pass a regulation which insulates itself from judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.654" offset="14793059">That would be both the clear statements requirement, as well as the principle laid down by this Court that, in an ambiguous situation dealing with deportation, ambiguities are to be construed in favor of the alien.</text>
