            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="8.994" offset="141416">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.147" offset="165972">The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act imposes liability on debt collectors for certain prohibited dept collection practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.525" offset="203483">The Act provides however a so-called Bona Fide Error Defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.008" offset="225426">Under that defense a debt collector can avoid liability by showing that a violation of the Act was “not intentional and resulted from a bonafide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error”.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.295" offset="294599">The petition filed this lawsuit alleging that respondents a law firm and one of its attorneys violated the Act in attempting to collect the debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.073" offset="333678">The District Court found that the Bona Fide Error Defense shielded respondents for liability, for the violation in question, which had resulted from their misunderstanding of the Act’s legal requirements, the Sixth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.247" offset="394386">For the reasons set forth more fully in our opinion, we hold that the Bona Fide Error Defense does not apply to violations that result from the debt collector’s misinterpretation of the Act’s legal requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.746" offset="448408">Our holding follows from the statute's text, structure and history and in our view will not impose unworkable practical burdens on employers who act as debt collectors.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.835" offset="496786">Because the Sixth Circuit held that violations resulting from mistaken legal interpretations of the Act could qualify under the Bona Fide Error Defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.275" offset="538478">We reverse the judgment of that Court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.581" offset="567735">Justice Breyer has filed a concurring opinion, Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.145" offset="602008">Justice Kennedy has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Alito has joined.</text>
