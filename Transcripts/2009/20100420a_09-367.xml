            <text syncTime="7.254" offset="134416">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Mandatory Victim Restitution Act makes restitution a mandatory part of a defendant's sentence for certain crimes, and it sets out two paths by which a district court can meet its responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.881" offset="204946">First, section 3663A(a)(1) authorizes district courts to impose restitution when sentencing a defendant; that is, at the same time that they impose terms of imprisonment, fines, probation, or the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.141" offset="265968">Second, section 3664(d)(5) of the Act allows final determination of the amount of restitution to occur during a period not to exceed 90 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.266" offset="314452">Once those periods and the general deadlines for correcting or appealing a sentence have passed, a court's judgment is final, even if it fails to order restitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.025" offset="365547">In this, the Mandatory Victim Restitution Act is like all other mandatory sentencing provisions, and as this Court confirmed 2 years ago in Greenlaw v. United States, when a court fails to impose a mandatory sentence, that error can be corrected only by following what this Court called the dispositive direction regarding sentencing errors--</text>

            <text syncTime="109.335" offset="542762">If I understand your question correctly, the district court has imposed sentence on day one announcing imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.703" offset="564182">Any time during the next 90 days, it has a power to set a date and make final determination of the restitution amount.</text>

            <text syncTime="2709.684" offset="10944199">--Well, that would be -- yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.184" offset="10954125">That would be our view, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.386" offset="10958932">Now, what I would say is, it is, first of all, our view that the Court doesn't need to resolve any of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.254" offset="10974396">But, second of all, one of the reasons is there is another way the Court could resolve this, which is to follow the approach the Court took in its decision in Corey v. United States, which is cited in the blue brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.777" offset="11012535">Now, Corey involved a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.479" offset="11019327">It's presentence -- it's pre-Federal sentencing guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.562" offset="11027686">It involves a statute that said if, at the time of the sentencing, the district court feels like it needs more information to decide how long to send the defendant to jail for, it may commit the defendant to the discretion of the Attorney General for a period of either 3 to 6 months; get, essentially, a PSR, before there were PSRs; and then make a determination then.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.873" offset="11100933">The Court in Corey faced the question: When the district court does that -- it says, I'm going to give you to the Attorney General, and we'll come back in 6 months and decide what your sentence will be -- when does the defendant have to appeal?</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.912" offset="11141057">That was the question before the Court in Corey.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.764" offset="11148476">What the Court said in Corey is that the defendant may appeal either at the time he is committed to the discretion of the Attorney General or at the time the district court imposes the final sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.536" offset="11187555">The reason the Court said that -- this is the language that's cited in the blue brief -- is the Court said it would be extraordinary to tell a Federal criminal defendant that he might have to wait up to 6 months in order to take a notice of appeal from his judgment of conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2844.835" offset="11484724">The government's position is that at the time the judgment of conviction and the sentence of imprisonment are entered, that is the time at which the defendant has to appeal and, in our view, he may appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.290" offset="11522550">Later, when the sentence of restitution is imposed, that is when he appeals that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.492" offset="11539372">What I was suggesting is that, to the extent the Court has any concern about that, the alternative way of resolving this issue would be the same way the Court approached the issue in Corey, and you could say that the defendant could appeal at either time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.114" offset="11581900">Now, we think that would be incorrect, but it would be open to the Court to do so to -- or to leave the issue open in order to resolve this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2943.712" offset="11880218">But that -- that points up a difference between this case and Montalvo-Murillo.</text>

            <text syncTime="2964.607" offset="11963810">That was by its terms a bail determination, which by its nature is not a final determination in the sense that a criminal statute is, though the Court's language doesn't really suggest that that would make any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.463" offset="12003307">And I would say that some of the other cases in this same line of cases, including some of the ones Justice Breyer mentioned, did raise finality concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.450" offset="12031206">There was a very strong finality concern raised in the Peabody Coal case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2991.221" offset="12070285">And so, there are -- some of the cases in this same line have also involved finality, admittedly not in the criminal context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.958" offset="12093273">But I think the -- the most important thing that the Court said in -- the two most important things that the Court said in Montalvo-Murillo, as are relevant here, is that, first, when Congress doesn't specify a remedy -- and Congress has not specified a remedy in this case -- it's inappropriate for courts to impose their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.968" offset="12153250">The second thing that the Court said is that we should presume that Federal district courts are going to comply with legal obligations, and we shouldn't make rules based on the assumption that they won't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.008" offset="12189403">And third is that when courts do impose remedies, they shouldn't make -- impose a remedy where there's a profound lack of fit between the violation that occurred and the remedy that the defendant is asking them to impose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.298" offset="12234648">Let me give you an example on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.064" offset="12241648">The general rule in Federal criminal litigation is that the Federal district court is supposed to impose sentence without unnecessary delay.</text>

            <text syncTime="3044.789" offset="12284594">It takes too long to impose a sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.672" offset="12292117">I think it would be extraordinary to suggest that the remedy of a district court's unnecessary delay in sentencing the defendant means the defendant should get off scot-free.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.992" offset="12325345">The remedy is to tell the district court you have taken too long to impose the sentence; impose the sentence forthwith.</text>
