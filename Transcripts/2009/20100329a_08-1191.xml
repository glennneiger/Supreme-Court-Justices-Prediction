            <text syncTime="18.895" offset="183066">First, the scope of section 10(b) of the 1934 Exchange Act when applied to alleged fraudulent conduct with respect to financial information that is to be sent to Australia for incorporation into the financial statements of the Respondent, National Australia Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.356" offset="256940">And second, the reasonableness of the application of the statute under these circumstances and the norms of enforcement pursuant to the private cause of action or otherwise.</text>

            <text syncTime="59.805" offset="346697">I mean, as I recall, the other side says we shouldn't get to the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="134.270" offset="644598">What we particularly thought might be instructive for this Court is to hear what the Second Circuit that sits in our nation's financial capital thought of a new fact, and that new fact is that for the first time the Securities and Exchange Commission has come in and said as a matter of administrative deference the Court should defer to our test in cases like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.202" offset="736235">Sure, they have submitted amicus briefs in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.154" offset="748042">They have done lots of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.170" offset="752118">But this is the first time they have said: We as the agency responsible for the statute have said this is how courts should handle the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.426" offset="781166">That's what's new and different, but if Your Honors don't wish to proceed along that line we are prepared to go forward on -- on the merits here today.</text>

            <text syncTime="474.665" offset="2006100">The first thing we meant was that, in addition to the other tests that are proposed, putting Sinochem at the beginning of the train would sort out some of these questions in general.</text>

            <text syncTime="495.611" offset="2089900">And we would win that because the statute specifically provides in section 10(b) that fraud can be caused in any number of ways -- three ways, including through the mails, through foreign or interstate commerce, or over an exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.085" offset="2143817">And that fraud was caused in Florida and the mails were used and it was in foreign or interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.073" offset="2171716">And the people who committed the fraud on a nuts-and-bolts level are the senior management who are defendants from HomeSide bank in Florida, so to that extent it is a Florida case.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.165" offset="2224170">And we also think that any district judge in looking at a forum non motion would also look at the various interests of National Australia Bank in HomeSide in the United States to judge the overall fairness of letting the suit proceed against them and to counter the issue that this is really all about Australia.</text>

            <text syncTime="819.793" offset="3386619">Perhaps one of the most important parts of the record is the Solicitor General's view that as a general matter -- and I will get to the specifics; I'm not ducking that.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.332" offset="3432803">But as a general matter the enforcement of the securities laws, unlike the antitrust laws, has not historically and today they do not believe runs -- raises a substantial risk of interstate conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.239" offset="3488392">Now, as to the specific briefs that Your Honor referenced, if we look at those briefs and we look at those compared to what happened in Hartford Fire, those briefs -- and let's focus on Australia's for the moment because that's the country we are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.499" offset="3545443">Australia's brief essentially says they have a regulatory system that may -- that we may or may not have been able to litigate this cause of action in Australia, but let's assume that we could.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.707" offset="3590269">They are not saying -- they did not say in that brief that there was some fundamental conflict, like the plurality found in Hartford Fire; nor did they say that there was the kind of conflict that comes up in the application of 403(h) of the Restatement, which Justice Scalia looked to in his opinion in Hartford Fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.655" offset="3682116">So there is not the kind of conflict that leads necessarily -- necessarily -- to not reasonably applying the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.194" offset="3724225">The reason there's not is that because, one, there is not a rule in Australia that one has to abide by and a rule in the United States that one has to abide by that are contradictory.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.419" offset="3773127">At most, what you have is you have a clear rule in the United States that says thou shalt not commit fraud in Florida through either the Florida through either -- for or in interstate commerce, the mails or through an exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.209" offset="3816281">And on the other side of the equation what you have is maybe they could have brought suit over here and we have a robust regulatory system and a robust litigation system; more power to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.803" offset="3870720">But that doesn't mean -- saying that, that doesn't mean that the first State where the poison candy was made suddenly has no interest in that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1417.268" offset="5776509">The general criticism of these cases is that they are gotcha cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.889" offset="5795004">You put in a little bit and all of a sudden the private bar comes and attacks you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1427.442" offset="5817260">Well, the stereotype is wrong and it's important to understand why the stereotype is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.494" offset="5833456">Because if all you have is a very modest investment in the ADR market, 1 percent like my friends from NAB, those cases get bounced at the beginning on personal jurisdiction as they did in the district of New Jersey in SCORS and the Novagold case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.170" offset="5896150">We are not aware of any case where if all you've got is that little toehold that you stay in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.760" offset="5922482">You get bounced by -- on personal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.443" offset="5933244">And to pick up on the discussion that I was having with Justice Ginsburg, we thought that in addition to that, if the Court wanted to send signals with respect to these kinds of cases, if you put, as you can, Sinochem at the beginning of the train, even more of these cases if they are fallacious are going to be screened out of the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.708" offset="6018299">So, the point is that we can all tell our Australian friends that there are very rigid safeguards in place so that this horror story in reality doesn't happen and it has not been proven to happen.</text>

            <text syncTime="1528.020" offset="6219546">They go out early on personal jurisdiction; there is not a lot of discovery on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.324" offset="6236787">They go out early -- if Sinochem gets applied faithfully, it would go out early on that if there is a close question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.429" offset="6269179">And then you go to the 12(b)(6).</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.095" offset="6275866">And pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, one of the purposes of that is no discovery, no discovery until after the motion to dismiss is decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.987" offset="6319438">So it is not true that there is a lot of discovery, there is a lot of transaction costs, before we know the answer to one of the threshold questions, which is: Should this case be in our system or not?</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.894" offset="6367086">That can be handled and it is being handled on a daily basis, notwithstanding, you know, some stereotypes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.631" offset="6398015">Now, my final point with respect to Professor Sachs' articles and some of the other articles is they in effect -- if they advocate a rule, which many of them do, which it should be limited to exchanges, that goes back to my threshold point of the scope of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.074" offset="6463739">And it takes an eraser to the statute and it says: It's only exchanges; it's not in connection with foreign or interstate commerce or through the mails; it's limited, contrary to the express words of the statute, in a way that the statutory construction we don't believe can stand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.102" offset="6535837">Now, there are other legitimate ways of cabining the private cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.006" offset="6551510">But that -- if you are faithful to the statute, we submit that is not one of them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3252.949" offset="13119216">They base their -- what they want to do is to limit the private rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.586" offset="13137816">And I think the United Kingdom brief specifically says that -- it thinks that SEC action could be appropriate here, and that's a reason why, if the Court adopts the -- a limit on the private actions, that it need not -- it need not be concerned about the possibility that -- that fraud would be launched in the United States or directed in the United States and it couldn't be addressed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3317.353" offset="13376888">Those are the two administrative adjudications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.305" offset="13388696">The SEC's administrative adjudicatory authority is limited to people involved in the securities industry, and a lot of these frauds that happen are -- don't involve people that are registered broker/dealers and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.397" offset="13457032">There are numerous Civil Actions that the SEC has brought where it has taken the same approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.734" offset="13482423">The SEC v. Berger case that we cite in our brief is one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.622" offset="13497992">I can name some others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.240" offset="13508441">There is SEC v. Wolfson, which is a case that's in the district court in Utah, and SEC v. Shay in -- in the southern district of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.112" offset="13551909">SEC v. Banger in the northern district of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.231" offset="13564343">Those involve international boiler-room schemes of the kind I was alluding to before, where masterminds in the United States basically direct agents that they have got in countries like Thailand or Spain to -- to make false statements and engage in high-pressure selling to target investors in other countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.413" offset="13653159">Sometimes they induce them to engage in transactions in still other countries.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas A. Dubbs</label>
            <text syncTime="3396.285" offset="13692656">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.756" offset="13710524">Let me begin with Justice Alito's question, and I promise to get back to Judge Friendly and the Brooklyn Bridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.458" offset="13729332">As to -- we have alleged that in -- that effectively, ministerial activities did occur here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.830" offset="13766740">The Second Circuit held, interpreting our complaint, that the numbers were mechanically incorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.883" offset="13787011">That's as close to ministerial as you get.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.919" offset="13795161">We used, in the complaint, the were "adopted".</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.435" offset="13805192">We said that they were asleep at the wheel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.387" offset="13813029">The meaning is the same, but the -- there were no checkpoints.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.423" offset="13829120">The checkpoints are illusory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.858" offset="13834867">If there was a checkpoint, the guard was asleep at the checkpoint, and the MSR number went right through the checkpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.345" offset="13856810">Those are the allegations, and we should be able to stick with the allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.481" offset="13873424">Now, turning to the statute, my colleague indicated that the language with respect to foreign and interstate commerce and so on, based on the Aramco decision, was boilerplate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.337" offset="13912816">That's wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.289" offset="13916578">In this statute, those specific statutory approaches towards stopping fraud are in the substance of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.508" offset="13945522">They are not in the jurisdictional statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.710" offset="13954299">That's important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.827" offset="13958792">That's why that's different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.096" offset="13963807">As to the Leasco example and Bersch example, what Leasco shows is a long chain of causation, because Leasco involved an American, not a foreigner, which was very important under Judge Friendly's typology.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.006" offset="14019500">And in Leasco, you have this extended line of causation beginning with representations in the United States about a friendly, tender offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.576" offset="14049802">Then there was a phone call, maybe in London, maybe in the United States, and then there was a command by Saul Steinberg to his investment bankers: Go into the London Stock Exchange and start to buy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.967" offset="14091285">That extended line of causation would not pass muster under the direct cause test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.852" offset="14110824">The direct cause test as this Court is using it in the RICO area under cases like Hemi, that would not pass muster.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.608" offset="14145933">What that shows, and Judge Friendly said that if you have a foreign Plaintiff, the direct cause is appropriate, that shows that the direct cause test is narrower, it's a screening device, and it limits the possibilities when you have a foreign Plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.868" offset="14206955">Now, that is a proper way to cabin the private cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.920" offset="14223151">Taking an eraser to the statute and saying: The only words that count are on an exchange, doesn't do it if you are going to keep a linkage between the private cause of action and the expressed words of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.893" offset="14271007">So if that can't do it, what are the other tools?</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.762" offset="14282501">And the other tools are the direct cause test, and this Court has been very ably working through some of these difficult fact patterns in the RICO area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.384" offset="14320953">Now, in this case, there is not the problem that there is in Hemi; there is not the intervening cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.105" offset="14343837">You have a related party, NAB, that may or may not be involved that allegedly is broken -- breaking the chain of causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.793" offset="14378632">It is -- has to be, under that doctrine, a totally third party, as it was in Hemi, where you have the State of New York, the City of New York and had all these bouncing balls going back and forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.983" offset="14423353">This is a straight shot between that MSR being fabricated in Florida and going on to the financial statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.689" offset="14450207">There is no intervening cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.389" offset="14456999">And even if we assume that in some senses, it was normal to look at those financial statements, that in and of -- of itself has failed.</text>
