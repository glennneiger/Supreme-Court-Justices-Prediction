            <text syncTime="195.635" offset="889020">The written policy is unconstitutional because it's overtly viewpoint discrimination -- discriminatory and thus violating the principles of cases like Rosenberger and Widmar.</text>

            <text syncTime="304.342" offset="1323802">Mr. McConnell, when I read -- when I read the papers that Hastings submitted to the district court at the same time that the joint stipulation was submitted, I saw one reference after another to an allegation that Hastings was applying its policy in a discriminatory manner, that it was not in fact insisting that all registered student organizations admit all applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.629" offset="1420978">And when I read their brief in the Ninth Circuit, I saw that point reiterated again and again.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.672" offset="1445115">So that led me to believe that what was stipulated was not that in fact they had a policy which they enforced under which anybody who applied to any group would be admitted, but that this was what Dean Kane had announced.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.978" offset="1518362">That was the stated policy, but not necessarily the actual policy that was employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.598" offset="1548873">And that was the argument it seemed to me that CLS was making; isn't that correct?</text>
