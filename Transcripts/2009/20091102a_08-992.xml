            <text syncTime="144.220" offset="683280">But it really doesn't matter for our position, and that's because the rule that was applied to this defendant was a discretionary rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="159.297" offset="743675">The opinion that was written by the trial court and is in the joint appendix at page -- I believe it's 69, Your Honor -- states that the question was whether the trial judge abused his discretion in declining to reinstate post-trial motions.</text>

            <text syncTime="201.374" offset="911903">The question is -- the Third Circuit, as I read the opinion, was concerned that it wasn't firmly established at the time of the waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.562" offset="944713">I have real problems with whether the waiver should even be -- whether the time of the waiver is controlling, but that is not the question you asked us to resolve.</text>

            <text syncTime="218.352" offset="979822">--Your Honor, I think the problem here and the reason that we are at this point is that, whether the test is stated directly as being a per se ban on discretion or whether simply the standard is so high under an interpretation of "firmly established" that allows for virtually no deviation in results by the State courts, the effect is the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="259.245" offset="1143453">Justice Ginsburg -- you pointed Justice Ginsburg to page 23, and the Court very directly there says, look, we are rejecting the State's argument that the waiver rule was mandatory.</text>

            <text syncTime="301.489" offset="1312413">The problem is that the Third Circuit did not engage in any inquiry about the nature of the rule that was applied to this defendant, so it was not in any position to say that a different rule was applied to this defendant than the rule that should have been applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.230" offset="1363404">That's the problem with the argument that a new rule was sprung on this defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.451" offset="1380227">The rule that was applied to this defendant was discretion, and the Third Circuit never discusses anything other than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.187" offset="1403214">They reject our argument that the underlying rule was mandatory in that language, but they never discuss what rule was actually applied to this defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.091" offset="1430800">We think it was clearly a discretionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.810" offset="1441667">But the -- the real question is whether, at the time of the default, the default that occurred by the extraordinary act of escaping, the defendant was not fairly apprised of the consequences of his action.</text>

            <text syncTime="380.521" offset="1628494">I can understand why we want to look at the time of the waiver if it's an attorney arguing about jury instructions and so forth, but the man escapes when the door is open or when the window is open, and he doesn't give consideration to these things; and if he does, I think that's quite irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.614" offset="1688889">It seems to me that the waiver point is -- is something that shouldn't be conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.535" offset="1712609">I think that if ten years elapse between the time of the escape and the time the State formulates its rules, that he is bound by those rules when he gets there.</text>

            <text syncTime="414.092" offset="1762764">Well, I think, Your Honor, what we are presenting is that the nature of the State rule here was -- was such that the defendant had reasonable notice of what he was facing by escaping, whether or not it would have affected his subjective decision to escape, and therefore that the State ground can't be thrown out in Federal court on the ground of adequacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.006" offset="1850431">And really, whether the rule was strictly mandatory in 1984 or discretionary doesn't much matter for purposes of putting the defendant on notice that if he escaped, he was going to run into serious trouble trying to appeal at the same time that he was trying to stay in Canada for the rest of his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.135" offset="1915005">That's what this case is really all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.652" offset="1925036">And yet, the lower courts I think have so misconstrued this Court's adequacy doctrine that they have come to the point of saying that even in that situation, the rule is inadequate and can be ignored in Federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="617.840" offset="2577784">The question is what those circumstances are, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.225" offset="2587293">And in virtually case after case, the circumstances that have been identified by this Court for actually finding a rule inadequate are that the State rule was some kind of bait and switch, that it was a -- to use Justice Holmes' classic formulation, that it was a spring -- a trap that was sprung on the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.603" offset="2656883">One rule existed at the time that the litigant was proceeding, another rule was applied when the case reached appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.507" offset="2684468">And that is characteristically what has made this Court, not the lower Federal courts, but this Court, hold that rules were actually inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.280" offset="2715606">So in Ford v. Georgia, for example, where the defendant raised a Batson claim after the jury was sworn, because that's what the law was at the time of his trial, when the case reached appeal the appellate -- the State appellate court said: No, no; we have a new rule now; you have to do it before the jury is sworn.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.873" offset="2773912">And they found his claim waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.892" offset="2786032">That rule was inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.424" offset="2792093">In James v. Kentucky, where the defendant asked for an adverse inference charge and he asked for an admonition rather than an instruction, and the State court said, no, no, it was supposed to be an instruction rather than an admonition, that was a reversal of prior State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.817" offset="2845696">There are many cases very much like that where there is a spring set by the State in the sense that a different rule is applied on appeal than was before the litigant at the time that he was trying to comply with the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.411" offset="2904106">Now, this case obviously is quite far from that, and that's exactly why this case should have been the last sort of case where a rule was found inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.735" offset="2953425">The higher the standard that the lower courts apply, the stricter the standard that the lower Federal courts apply to analyze the adequacy of State rules, the less opportunity there will be for discretion on the part of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.144" offset="3007028">And the loser in that equation, while it might not be this defendant, will be the vast majority of defendants who would have been more entitled, more deserving of discretion, of leniency from the State courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.821" offset="3065752">The State courts need to be allowed to apply the kind of discretion in their procedural rulings that this Court applies, that the Federal courts are allowed in -- in Federal procedural rulings -- for example, under the plain error rule, even under the Federal fugitive-forfeiture rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.680" offset="3133147">In 1876 this Court said that it's within our discretion to dismiss a case where the defendant is a fugitive, and since then, while there have been a number of decisions from this Court concerning fugitive defendants, none of them have laid out the sort of menu, the sort of standards and substandards and subrules that the defendant is now arguing have to be present in a rule for it to be adequate.</text>

            <text syncTime="965.084" offset="3966767">Basically, they -- they are taking out their magnifying glasses and starting to split hairs by looking at every single case, by looking at how those cases compare to each other, by deciding whether there's enough of a standard, is there enough of a precedent, did you tell this little particular little fact to the defendant before.</text>

            <text syncTime="3446.927" offset="13894134">And I think that's the problem with just trying to remand this case without doing more, because that's where you wind up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.998" offset="13922450">If the lower Federal courts continue to undertake the kind of consistency analysis that they think consistency requires, it will drive that sort of discretion out, and you will wind up with forfeiture rules and other State procedural rules that are all automatic, because that's the way the Federal courts will be telling the State courts that their rules will be found adequate State grounds and enforceable on Federal habeas corpus review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.315" offset="14027672">There was no subterfuge here the -- to avoid or evade the Federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.485" offset="14052436">The argument in favor of that position is: Look at all the other cases where the State court did address Federal constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.610" offset="14092873">Well, exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.710" offset="14097262">Of course we did in many other capital cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.644" offset="14109069">And the -- the penalty for trying to be lenient in those other cases is that now in the worst case we can't apply any sort of forfeiture, any sort of procedural bar, even for a guy who breaks out of jail twice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3518.856" offset="14181898">--That defendant was gone less than two weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.642" offset="14192974">And, so, we withdrew our motion to quash his appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.360" offset="14207916">It's not just that the State court didn't grant it, we withdrew it because he was recaptured in New York two weeks later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.450" offset="14232263">This guy was out for seven years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.583" offset="14240726">After he was captured the first time in Canada and started to fight extradition, his post verdict motions were dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.138" offset="14271028">The motions that he had been -- and told him that under state law at that time were absolutely essential to preserving any claim for further review, and his response to the dismissal of his post verdict motions after the first escape was to break out of jail again a second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.165" offset="14331110">During the second escape, somebody died, another prisoner fell to his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.052" offset="14350649">During the first escape the plan, the diversion that allowed this defendant to sneak out through the window he sought through was to have a riot staged on the part of the other prisoners, during which they tried to push one of the prison guards off the third tier of the prison cells to the floor below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.930" offset="14422120">That would -- that caused all the other guards to rush up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.313" offset="14431734">During that time the defendant slipped out the window.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.815" offset="14441660">That's why this was the case where the court exercised its discretion to impose a procedural bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.821" offset="14469768">Mr. Lawry says, well, the Commonwealth just wants to execute him without any sort of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.290" offset="14491606">He did have limited review, as Justice Kennedy pointed out, but really you are left with only the two choices of imposing a procedural bar, a bar that this Court said was longstanding and well established in American law in Estelle v. Dorrough--</text>
