            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="5.987" offset="129400">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="8.637" offset="139954">A habeas petition challenging a new State court judgment for the first time cannot be a second or successive petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.926" offset="173077">AEDPA, of course, is a highly complex statutory system that has many interdependent parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.663" offset="196065">The pivotal language of this case, section 2244, is reproduced at page 2 of the blue brief, of Petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.369" offset="226889">What that section does is it restricts claims that can be brought in, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="35.839" offset="248728">"a second or successive habeas corpus application. "</text>
            <text syncTime="39.041" offset="261580">under section 2254.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.327" offset="270775">So this text establishes a two-step framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.029" offset="285508">First, the court needs to decide whether it's dealing with a second or successive petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.831" offset="304734">And second, if it is and only if it is, then the Court applies the modified res judicata principles set forth in that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.420" offset="335141">Now, this case involves only the first of those two steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.805" offset="348620">And a petition, as here, that challenges a new death sentence cannot be a second or successive petition for the very simple reason that it challenges a State court judgment that has no -- never been covered in a habeas petition before.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="74.798" stopTime="157.766">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="74.798" offset="404626">2244 doesn't make any reference to judgment, 2244(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="82.368" offset="434928">And now you bring in the concept of a judgment by looking at another provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.456" offset="459274">But if 8 of your brief can be correct; namely, that when a prisoner such as Petitioner obtains habeas relief from his sentence but not his conviction, any habeas petition after his resentencing that challenged his conviction would be successive.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.158" offset="582050">You suggest that there are two judgments; there is a judgment of sentence and there is a judgment of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.545" offset="607650">But for habeas purposes, the only thing that is relevant is the judgment pursuant to which the Petitioner is held in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.585" offset="643803">And that is the judgment -- that is the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.020" offset="657492">So I -- I -- if your argument is correct that you look to whether there's a second or successive application as to a judgment, then the point you make in footnote 8 just cannot be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.612" offset="707856">So that if Petitioner gets sentencing relief, gets resentenced, in the second petition the Petitioner can challenge the conviction.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="157.766" offset="736486">But, Justice Alito, let me make clear how we get to incorporating judgment and then answer your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.420" offset="759056">The way that you incorporate the word 2244&gt; ["].</text>
            <text syncTime="170.574" offset="787686">And section 2244 defines -- and this is at the bottom of the page, of page 2--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="175.145" stopTime="175.812">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="175.145" offset="805972">I understand that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jeffrey_l_fisher" startTime="175.812" stopTime="217.889">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="175.812" offset="808688">--defines it as</text>
            <text syncTime="177.014" offset="813495">"seeking relief from a State court judgment. "</text>
            <text syncTime="179.114" offset="821854">Now, you are right that -- that -- that if somebody receives relief only as to their sentence and gets a new death sentence, as in this case, that the judgment he is challenging is new only as to the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.475" offset="887369">Now, there -- the word U.S. Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.843" offset="900744">There is two other places I am aware of where this Court had to construe the word "judgment".</text>
            <text syncTime="202.562" offset="915686">One of them is when this -- is with respect to this Court's jurisdiction over final State court judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.449" offset="939196">And in that realm -- this is in Brady v. Maryland in footnote 1 it's laid out.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.370" offset="958945">In that realm, this Court treats the judgment as having two parts that can be final--</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="217.889" offset="977021">Well, if a -- if someone has a -- a judgment of conviction, but is no longer in custody, that -- that person cannot bring habeas petition, isn't that right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jeffrey_l_fisher" startTime="228.779" stopTime="229.412">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="228.779" offset="1020489">--That's right.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="229.412" offset="1023101">So it -- it is the judgment pursuant to which the person then is held in custody to which the habeas petition goes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jeffrey_l_fisher" startTime="236.683" stopTime="281.061">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="236.683" offset="1052150">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.468" offset="1055284">And in Burton this Court made it very clear that the judgment that he's being held in custody as to is the new judgment that he is challenging.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.805" offset="1088616">Now, what I'm saying is in the Brady context this Court has treated judgment as having two parts that can be final as to one and not as to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.911" offset="1121113">In other contexts in Burton, for purposes of seeking an appeal or seeking habeas relief, it is treated as inseparable.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.632" offset="1143996">And the common thread between those two circumstances has been what minimizes Federal intrusion on State affairs?</text>
            <text syncTime="266.219" offset="1170328">And so in this context that's a very easy answer, because what this Court always assumed, and correctly so, I believe, is that if the only thing that is unconstitutional is somebody's sentence, that's the only thing a Federal court has the power to invalidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.378" offset="1226961">And that's the only thing--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="281.061" offset="1229678">What if the sentence is -- he is convicted, sentenced to 10 years, and raises an argument, and only an argument, that cuts off 2 years of his sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.317" offset="1262696">He says under the statute the maximum is 8 years, and the court says, the judgment is vacated to the extent it goes beyond 8 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.423" offset="1299163">Can he then bring a new challenge to, say, the whole sentence, or cut it off at 4 years, or does that limit his challenge?</text>
            <text syncTime="308.814" offset="1340646">In other words, I'm trying to get to the point that it's not just the conviction, but if it's a period of the sentence that is not subject to challenge the first time?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jeffrey_l_fisher" startTime="316.051" stopTime="355.025">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="316.051" offset="1369590">--Well, I don't know, Mr. Chief Justice, that that question could actually arise in a section 2254 case, where the only thing a Federal court has power to do is to declare one way or the other whether the sentence is constitutional or not and then leave it to the State to decide in further proceedings how to -- how to go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.763" offset="1440434">In the Federal context in section 2255, the question you suggest might arise, and indeed it has in a few places.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.600" offset="1463839">And the question that the Federal courts have asked themselves in the second habeas petition, the second in time habeas petition, is the -- is the Petitioner challenging something he lost on the first time?</text>
            <text syncTime="351.407" offset="1511069">And if the answer to that is yes, then it's a successive petition.</text>

            <text syncTime="372.352" offset="1594870">If you take a step beyond that, then there -- then there isn't a textual basis for drawing this distinction between the sentence and the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.958" offset="1633217">And what you need to ask is what is consistent with the scheme of that; isn't that right?</text>

            <text syncTime="400.002" offset="1705420">I think in this context it ought to treat them as able to be divided.</text>

            <text syncTime="1172.922" offset="4797064">Any claim, the State says, that you could have raised the first time is forever barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.909" offset="4821096">And that gets to, well, I still don't think I have quite answered the question on second or successive, so let me continue that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.413" offset="4847114">We are giving meaning to that term "second or successive".</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.615" offset="4859862">It's important to understand that, whatever slight difficulty you have with the word "judgment" and making sense of the words "second or successive" in our case are dwarfed by the interpretive difficulties, in fact the impossibilities, with respect to the State's proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.524" offset="4915555">The State's proposal -- and it's laid out at page 17 of its brief, at the top of the page, right after the number 1 -- the State's proposed rule -- and I think it's useful to put it next to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.582" offset="4963725">The State's proposed rule is if a claim could have been or was raised in a prior petition, it is barred by Section 2244 (2) or (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.688" offset="5000192">Now, the first thing you will notice is that the words "second or successive" appear nowhere in the State's rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1241.983" offset="5073335">And we know -- we know from Martinez-Villareal and Slack and other cases that second in time petitions are not necessarily successive and certainly they ought not to be thought of as successive when they challenge a different judgment or a different conviction or the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.624" offset="5123908">But what the State is asking for is a brandnew waiver system that has never been imposed in any decision from this Court and there have been three decisions from this Court where it would have come up.</text>

            <text syncTime="1534.246" offset="6242367">Even, again, go back to the idea of having a new trial based on new -- based on new facts and new evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.018" offset="6273505">Trying to figure out whether it's the same claim, a different claim; imagine a claim based on a prosecutor's closing argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.506" offset="6299418">Well, unless the prosecutor reads the exact same script a second time, there is going to be a huge fight over whether it's a new claim, an old claim, a different claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.992" offset="6329407">And finally, the State's other -- the other prong of the State's test is about claims that were raised before are now barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.598" offset="6359813">Now, the State immediately recognizes that that's a huge problem because it would bar defendants from making -- from seeking habeas relief if the State made the same violation the second time around.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.304" offset="6398683">So it invents a brand-new due process principle that has never been held to be -- to be in existence by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.577" offset="6431702">And indeed, in the Penry case, where this Court dealt with the Texas situation, where the State court made the same error twice, it went straight to the constitutional claim.</text>

            <label>Mr. Corey L. Maze</label>
            <text syncTime="1670.134" offset="6785923">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.002" offset="6797416">Even though they rose together, the State has litigated Magwood's mitigating circumstances in Federal court from 1983 to 1986, and now we have been litigating these aggravating circumstances from 1997 through today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.262" offset="6854468">That's piecemeal litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.045" offset="6861573">That's precisely the reason that AEDPA was passed under 2244(b) and that's precisely what the abuse of the writ doctrine was designed to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.218" offset="6894279">And it's based on the principle that this Court unanimously affirmed again yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.486" offset="6911415">You have equitable principles that say when you have two parties, a party has a full and fair opportunity to raise a claim or to litigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.842" offset="6944747">But the other party also has a finality interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.461" offset="6955301">And once you take away your full and fair opportunity by not using it, the other party's interest in finality outweighs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.447" offset="6983199">That's what Congress envisioned in AEDPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.816" offset="6992708">That's what this Court envisioned with the abuse of the writ doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.851" offset="7004829">That's why we don't allow someone who had a claim previously available that didn't use it to bring it again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.338" offset="7030742">And if I may, I want to go straight to Justice Alito's question about conviction versus sentence, and then to Justice Kennedy's about whether or not under Alabama law this is aggravated with something new to the resentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.810" offset="7076613">As far as judgment -- conviction versus sentence, I had two answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.931" offset="7093123">Justice Breyer got to the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.714" offset="7100228">On page 106, the new judgment, as Mr. Magwood would say, says,</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.166" offset="7118096">"I hereby judge you convicted of the underlying offense in the actual guilt phase and the sentence. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.420" offset="7143069">So it contains both, if you consider that a new judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.037" offset="7153518">But the second point is, if Magwood is correct that you can separate a judgment of sentence and conviction, then Burton is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.377" offset="7182879">Burton has to be wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.010" offset="7189462">Because the argument in Burton was -- he cited In Re Taylor, which was the exact same case we put in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.297" offset="7214644">He said: My first petition attacked the judgment of conviction; my second petition attacked the judgment of resentence, and because those are two separate judgments, this was my first chance to attack the judgment of sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.771" offset="7272532">And this Court said: No, it's one judgment; it's conviction and sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.942" offset="7289145">And because your first petition attacked that judgment that contained both, your second petition attacks the same judgment that contained both.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.530" offset="7323523">So if Mr. Magwood is right that you can separate the two, then Burton has to be wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="1924.969" offset="7805325">Because it's one of two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.486" offset="7811385">Either you vacated the entire judgment and the conviction and sentence are put back together -- they are -- it is a new judgment altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.325" offset="7842732">Or you look at specifically what the constitutional infirmity was that the Court identified in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.412" offset="7867079">The answer to Justice Kennedy's question is: There are four things under Alabama law at the time of this case that were necessary to have a death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.601" offset="7899784">The first was an indictment with an aggravating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.786" offset="7912532">The second was a conviction of a capital offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.821" offset="7924652">The third was the State announcing an aggravating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.123" offset="7937923">And the fourth was a penalty phase recommendation from the jury that was unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.427" offset="7955163">When this case went back, all four of those things were carried over from the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.915" offset="7977106">We didn't do any of those things again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.498" offset="7983376">They were all carried over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.348" offset="7986824">They are relics from the original trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.367" offset="7994870">The only thing new that happened was we added the two mitigators to the weighing calculus and it was reweighed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.287" offset="8018589">And we know that is true from the district court's opinion in the second case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.973" offset="8033322">Mr. Magwood claimed that he could bring a claim against the fact that we didn't re-empanel the penalty phase jury, which, again, is a sentencing claim, and the district court said no, the State court didn't have to re-empanel the jury to give another recommendation, because that wasn't the problem in the first case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.117" offset="8101867">The only problem in the first case was not having the two additional mitigators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.152" offset="8118063">And under the same rationale, the State's announcement of the aggravator was also a relic from the first case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.723" offset="8140319">And in fact, we know that, because in the circuit court's opinion in the first case, it specifically told the State court: If you will weigh the same aggravating circumstance against the four instead of two, we won't question your judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2071.046" offset="8389632">There is a simple answer to why the Federal courts can deal with this, and we know they can deal with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.348" offset="8406768">And the answer is: When this happens on direct appeal in a Federal prisoner's case -- for example, if a Federal prisoner says you shouldn't have enhanced my sentence for this one reason, and he gets a remand where the sentence is vacated, he is resentenced and it comes back up -- the circuit courts are unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.624" offset="8475941">They all say you can't challenge other enhancers from the original sentence because you could have raised it the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.112" offset="8497883">I can give you case after case after case where they have done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.797" offset="8508646">A good example: Judge Posner had the case U.S. v. Parker 101 at 3rd 527, where he says the exact same thing and his analysis is exactly what we are saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.502" offset="8547412">A party cannot use the accident of a remand to raise in a second appeal an issue that he just as well could have raised in the first appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.841" offset="8580744">And the principle is exactly the same, that the Federal courts in State habeas will look to see is this was an issue you could have raised the first time, and if it was, you are out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.911" offset="8613031">It would make no sense under AEDPA for a Federal prisoner on direct appeal to give the U.S. government a finality interest in enhancers that could have been challenged the first time, but not to give the same finality interest to States when they are coming into Federal court under AEDPA for aggravators that have been challenged the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.707" offset="8684293">Again, the whole purpose of AEDPA was to give finality to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.694" offset="8700176">If Federal government is going to get a greater interest than the States, then AEDPA is completely -- I mean, it's just completely wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.930" offset="8729119">Now, another problem with Magwood's argument is, he is going to kill an entire line of cases, the Kyzer cases, where you can challenge good time credits, parole credits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.452" offset="8771229">If you remember, in Kyzer, you said if you are challenging your good time, you can raise that in a 2254 petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.023" offset="8793485">Now, under Magwood's rule, if you read it as a second or successive application against a judgment -- let's assume that you've lost in your first habeas, so your first petition is now done and you have lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.497" offset="8835385">Good time credits are taken away from you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.180" offset="8846148">Under this Court's precedent, you raised that in a 2254 petition, but that petition will be the second petition under the same judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.436" offset="8879167">And he would be barred because the good time credit claims would meet an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.857" offset="8896825">It's not new facts or law that proves he's innocent, and therefore it is barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.559" offset="8911663">The only way that the circuits have been able to deal with that situation is exactly the way the State's saying here and that Justice Scalia is saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.879" offset="8940920">You ask the question first: Is this a claim that has been available before?</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.367" offset="8958892">And if it's not a claim that was available before, and because it's a good time claim that wasn't, then you say this is not a second or successive application, because it is the first application in which he could have brought the claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="2247.901" offset="9097028">The first is: This Court has defined a claim in Gonzalez v. Crosby, which is a 2254 case, as the assertion of a ground that entitles the Petitioner to habeas relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.506" offset="9135480">If you'll look at the question presented, Magwood agrees that this -- this says at the end:</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.243" offset="9158363">"The Petitioner could have challenged his previously imposed but now vacated sentence on the same constitutional grounds. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.664" offset="9184068">If the claim is grounds that can give you relief and he admits that it's the same grounds he could have gotten relief on the first time, it is the same claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.420" offset="9215101">Now, to the extent he is telling you this is a new injury, that -- the smoke example that Mr. Magwood is talking about, we disagree with that; to the extent that he would be right, the difference is in this case, he asked us to blow the smoke at him a second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.578" offset="9271735">Remember what happened in the first proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.596" offset="9283856">Magwood didn't challenge the aggravating circumstance, and then when we got to the court of appeals, he asked specifically the Eleventh Circuit to send this case back for resentencing so that the four mitigators could be weighed against the original aggravator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.974" offset="9345296">He asked for this to go back and to -- asked to have the aggravator applied to him again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.426" offset="9363163">So he invited the error.</text>

            <text syncTime="3002.737" offset="12116365">If I leave you with nothing else, think about the argument that you just heard that again and again talks about abuse of the writ, abuse of the writ, abuse of the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.709" offset="12148234">Well, there is now a statute that occupies this field, it's section 2254.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.411" offset="12167043">And abuse of the writ principles apply only if a petition is second or successive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.898" offset="12185015">So if this Court does nothing else, it has to define that term, and we are the only ones who have given you a definition of second or successive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.719" offset="12212287">And Congress made that decision for a reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.004" offset="12225452">It thought it was fair to impose strict burdens on relitigation to the extent that the defendant lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.007" offset="12249485">But when he wins, and gets a brand-new trial or a brand-new sentencing hearing--</text>

            <text syncTime="3072.181" offset="12394099">I am leaving everything else the same, because there was no arguments about it; there is no anything about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3103.533" offset="12519591">But let me tell you, Justice Sotomayor, that question can arise only in a Federal situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.604" offset="12535787">It cannot arise under section 2244 which gets to the other important point I wanted to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.322" offset="12554700">The State keeps talking about what the district court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.091" offset="12565776">Well, when the State -- when this case went to the Eleventh Circuit the first time, the State made it very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.594" offset="12583748">It complained, it said the district court can't remand this to the State courts, it can't micromanage what a State court does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.415" offset="12611124">All it can do -- and, Justice Scalia, this is, I think, most clearly put in your Wilkinson concurrence is order the release or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.421" offset="12643098">The Federal court in this case ordered Magwood's release from the death penalty unless the defendant -- unless the State wanted to elect to have a brandnew sentencing proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.777" offset="12680505">Now, the State elected to do that, and had every right to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.495" offset="12695448">But Magwood also had every right to insist on every constitutional protection in that circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.549" offset="12715614">And if I might finish this sentence, Mr. Chief Justice, when he -- we agreed if that Mr. Magwood had not properly preserved this argument the second time around, it would be procedurally defaulted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.940" offset="12757201">And if the State wants to make that argument on remand, it can.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.740" offset="12768381">But understand that the State's argument is asking you to say that a claim is barred from Federal habeas even if the defendant completely properly raises it the second time around and loses it and wants to then bring it to the Federal courts.</text>
