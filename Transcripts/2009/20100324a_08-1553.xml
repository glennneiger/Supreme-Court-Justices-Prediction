            <text syncTime="73.544" offset="399611">This Court had a factually identical import case just a few years ago in Kirby and, although it did not discuss the Carmack Amendment, this Court agreed unanimously on both reasoning and a result that are flatly inconsistent with Respondent's arguments here.</text>

            <text syncTime="95.319" offset="486651">But the case was considered on the basis of on the one hand, COGSA, and on the other, the law of 50 States.</text>

            <text syncTime="118.405" offset="579020">Our view has always been that this Court wouldn't have granted certiorari purely on the basis of a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.088" offset="597723">But in any event, this Court's reasoning in Kirby was that it's very important to foreign trade and to the uniformity of rules on a through shipment--</text>

            <text syncTime="142.768" offset="676509">But the -- for more than a century, the relevant Federal statutes have been construed harmoniously not to overlap in this particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.810" offset="708692">Foreign ocean commerce is governed by the Carriage of Goods At Sea Act, and the Carmack Amendment has always governed purely domestic traffic and exports to Canada and Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.056" offset="745681">Now, Respondents say that the settled meaning of that statute changed dramatically in 1978, but Congress said that it didn't.</text>

            <text syncTime="170.410" offset="787059">I mean, the language that they adopted sure looks quite different to me than what was applicable prior to 1978, and the boilerplate provision that, oh, when we codify this we don't mean to change anything -- I mean, which prevails, the actual language they used or that boilerplate?</text>

            <text syncTime="186.012" offset="849439">--Your Honor, I think that this Court's task, as always, is to read the statute as a whole, which includes that language that Your Honor characterizes as boilerplate, and also includes the language that we are here to construe.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.398" offset="894997">And you would want to read it all together if possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.475" offset="907327">So let's look at the -- at the present language.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.460" offset="915268">It appears at the back of Union Pacific's reply brief at page 6a.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.036" offset="929583">Just like it always has, Carmack distinguishes between receiving carriers, delivering carriers, and connecting carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.765" offset="968453">The simplest way to resolve this case is that I believe even Respondents would concede that for Carmack to apply, you need a receiving carrier that is a rail carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.499" offset="1007428">"K" Line is the receiving carrier here and they are not a rail carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.042" offset="1025609">Numerous decisions of this Court and the Interstate Commerce Commission confirm what the statute plainly says, which is that a rail carrier is a party providing common carrier railroad transportation, not--</text>

            <text syncTime="248.861" offset="1100842">The simplest way to resolve this case is that the present language, even taken on its face, requires a receiving carrier that is a rail carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.887" offset="1132920">"K" Line is the receiving carrier here.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.903" offset="1141070">They are not a rail carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.030" offset="1145563">This Court and the ICC have long held that merely subcontracting for common carrier service does not make you a common carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.868" offset="1176910">This Court held that in the American Railway Express case.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.040" offset="1185583">The ICC made this crystal clear in the CSX/SeaLand matter in 1987, where they held that the ocean carrier SeaLand was not a rail carrier simply because it subcontracted for inland rail transportation and provided carrier containers to the inland rail carrier.</text>

            <text syncTime="901.537" offset="3711519">And I think if you do that, particularly in this case, it's really not that hard to reconcile the pre-1978 law with the current law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1004.738" offset="4124359">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.580" offset="4135748">I would like to address a few of the questions that have come up already.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.624" offset="4151944">Justice Sotomayor you asked what Supreme Court decision addresses the receiving carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.030" offset="4169498">There is a series of decisions which address receiving carriers and the nature of the receiving carrier as the initial care that receives goods from the shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.152" offset="4201994">I would -- Mexican Light and Power Company, 1947, is probably the best, but that traces its way back all the way to the 1910s, Galveston Wharf Company, Ward, Starburg, Lish Milling, Riverside Mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.567" offset="4255702">These cases are largely cited at our brief at page 27 to 28, footnote 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.301" offset="4274615">Regarding the geographic scope of Carmack on the current text, we believe that the current text, which is reproduced in the petition appendix at 69a -- if you look at the combination of both the first and the third sentences of Carmack, we believe that that reproduces the historic scope as encompassing only domestic transportation, purely domestic transportation, and transportation to an adjacent foreign country when it's an export.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.054" offset="4385688">The first sentence requires that the rail carrier be providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the board and issue a receipt or bill of lading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.657" offset="4428006">The very purpose of Carmack from the very beginning, its core purpose, was to allow a shipper to sue the initial carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.077" offset="4457681">The initial carrier was responsible for the entire shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.310" offset="4470638">All the connecting carriers were deemed to be agents of the initial carrier and therefore there was an easy defendant for the shipper who dealt directly with that shipper -- or that carrier, and received a bill of lading from that carrier to sue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1166.496" offset="4771359">So I'm looking down at -- A. 2 provides that the jurisdiction of the STB applies only to transportation into the United States when that's between -- you know, part of a larger transit between the U.S. and a foreign country or even purely domestically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.270" offset="4842517">So, a shipper -- or a carrier that is subject to STB jurisdiction has to be providing this U.S. transportation when it issues the bill of lading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.749" offset="4880447">So the -- again, the central purpose was to provide a carrier by which -- against whom the shipper can bring suit in a convenient form, the person that the shipper dealt with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.883" offset="4932901">And that's now reflected in section -- the forum provision of Carmack which is subsection (d)(2), it provides that a suit under Carmack may only be brought against the originating rail carrier in the judicial district in which the point of origin is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.123" offset="5021926">And the prior provision said that that's a U.S. district court or a State court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1283.536" offset="5239578">The second bookend is the delivering carrier, and in between -- remember Carmack was intended to cover the entire carriage as a unified whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.206" offset="5274269">The in-between is transportation in the United States or export transportation from the United States to a point in a foreign country.</text>

            <text syncTime="3037.766" offset="12256486">Now, it is not true that the law was settled prior to 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.563" offset="12271637">The Woodbury case applied the Carmack Amendment to imports.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.515" offset="12283444">Union Pacific v. Burke applied it to imports.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.325" offset="12298700">And in those cases, this court made the determination that the words "from" and "to" were also meaning "between".</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.914" offset="12337048">And Congress, when it cleaned up the statute in 1978 and provided words that are very easy to understand now, was not changing what had been a well-settled practice of goods that were getting -- arriving at a port in the United States and then being transported by land means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.341" offset="12422834">And it's important to understand the context in which this arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.109" offset="12437880">Because I think our fundamental disagreement with the Solicitor General's presentation is that it ignores the container revolution that was occurring between the late 1950's and the '70s, when this act was codified and cleaned up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.650" offset="12495976">And in that container revolution, prior to the time when containers were used for multimodal transportation, it was common for goods to be repackaged at ports in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.314" offset="12538713">They were taken off ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.299" offset="12546654">They were repackaged, put onto trains or trucks, and that required a separate contractual arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.108" offset="12573821">Now, this Court, in Woodbury and Burke, had said it is not so important whether or not there is a separate contract, so long as the function and the intent is clear that it is being moved by rail or road in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.962" offset="12625230">The Carmack Amendment will apply, Justice Sotomayor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.274" offset="12634530">You are completely correct that the purpose of the Carmack Amendment was to hold railroads and motor carriers responsible for the liabilities caused by their loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.770" offset="12668489">But when Congress cleaned that up and put it in section 3, it was not intending to obviate the clear and unambiguous language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.080" offset="12701717">It was simply providing, you know, some boilerplate that I think is very difficult to -- to cause the Court to override the plain language of the statute today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.921" offset="12745080">And in 1995, when Congress eliminated -- terminated the ICC and enacted the ICC Termination Act, it reenacted that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.741" offset="12784368">It did not encompass section 3 at that time, so the statute as it presently exists does not have a statutory pointer as to how you are to interpret the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.438" offset="12827209">And under the normal canons that this Court has instructed for courts in the bar, the easiest way to practice law in this area is to look at the statute, see what it says, and not have to go back, not just through the last iteration of the statute, but the one before that, and not just to be able to look at what was in the U.S. Code, but to have to go back to the statutes at large to see what other statutory provisions Congress had put into the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.709" offset="12932221">That would make the practice of law extremely difficult.</text>

            <text syncTime="3367.969" offset="13577341">And -- and the point here about the forum is an important one, because Union Pacific has never thought that in these ocean bills of lading that that entitles American cargo interest to have to go to a foreign country under the ocean carrier's bill of lading in order to vindicate the interests in damage to their cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.884" offset="13665008">That was an invention by UP sought to remove it under the Carmack Amendment and transfer it to New York, and UP joined that motion and has argued throughout that the Carmack Amendment applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.517" offset="13719448">It would be unusual, to say the least, to allow UP now to take advantage of a contractual extension of COGSA where section 12 of COGSA, by its plain terms, in language that is completely ignored by the other side, says COGSA stops basically at the tackle-to-tackle period and does -- otherwise does not affect otherwise applicable law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3449.762" offset="13904499">Even Respondents can't really bring themselves to say that Union Pacific is the receiving carrier here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.681" offset="13928114">It's obviously not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.274" offset="13930517">They say that somehow, UP could be liable as the delivering carrier under Carmack.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.926" offset="13949116">But of course, if "K" Line is not a rail carrier, there is no receiving carrier who is obligated to issue a bill of lading under Carmack.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.066" offset="13977642">No one is allowed to under Carmack.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.766" offset="13984434">That is how the statute always worked, from 1906 to 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.766" offset="14004496">If the receiving carrier was not governed by Carmack, as it was not in any import case and in any export case except for Canada and Mexico, then Carmack did not apply to anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.590" offset="14047754">You can't parachute in midstream into the middle of a big movement and impose Carmack's obligations at the midpoint, because that would turn the historic purpose of Carmack completely upside down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.991" offset="14097387">It would read Carmack as mandating the commercial problem that Carmack was designed to solve.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.816" offset="14112643">The point of Carmack and the through bills under Carmack and COGSA is uniformity of responsibility under consistent terms for the whole voyage in one person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.000" offset="14149423">And the reason is that in order to recover from anyone, the shipper has to prove receipt of the goods in good condition by that carrier, and if you break the chain of the through bill, then you would have to prove -- the shippers would have to prove that Union Pacific, for instance, received the property in good order, when as Respondents concede, all that Union Pacific gets is a sealed container.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.397" offset="14243046">It has no idea at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.022" offset="14249524">And -- and so the shipper would be left in a position at the end of the day; it opens the container, there's damage; no one knows where it occurs; and there is -- there is no source of law, no source of facts to figure out where the damage occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.971" offset="14297276">Respondents raise a lot of questions about some track that they say "K" Line owns from Long Beach to Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.795" offset="14324652">None of this is in the record, and it's waived at this point, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.979" offset="14341371">It's not actually true, that's not "K" Line; it's an affiliate; and they don't provide rail transportation, it's a Union Pacific subsidiary that provides the rail transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.322" offset="14378674">But the real point is that all of this is far too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.989" offset="14389332">This case was decided on a rule 12(b)(3) motion to dismiss for improper venue, and the lower courts have made clear, sensibly, that if you are confronted with a forum selection motion to dismiss, you are required to at least come forward with any factual disputes that you think need to be resolved before the district court can grant or deny that motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.637" offset="14463937">It's far too late to wait until the Supreme Court of the United States, and say we have discovered some X number of miles--</text>
