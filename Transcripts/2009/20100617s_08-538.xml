            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">In case 08-538, Schwab versus Reilly, Justice Thomas has the opinion of the Court.</text>

            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="8.210" offset="138282">This case comes to us on a Writ of Certiorari in the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.789" offset="164613">Petitioner William Schwab is a trustee of respondent Reilly’s Chapter 7 bankruptcy estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.953" offset="193243">Reilly filed for bankruptcy when her catering business failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.957" offset="213201">When a debtor files for bankruptcy, the bankruptcy code provides that, all of the debtor’s assets become property of the bankruptcy estate, subject to the debtor’s right to reclaim certain property as exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.635" offset="279970">The bankruptcy code specifies the types of property debtors may exempt and also limits the value of the exemptions a debtor may claim in certain assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.482" offset="335350">Property a debtor claims as exempt, will be excluded from the bankruptcy estate unless a party in interest such as a trustee like Schwab objects to the exemption within a certain time period.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.964" offset="393237">In this case, we resolve the disagreement among the Courts of Appeals about what kind of information triggers the duty to file such an objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.444" offset="435242">Reilly’s professional cooking equipment was one of the assets that became property of the bankruptcy estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.324" offset="466693">This equipment had sentimental and professional value to Reilly and quite understandably, she wished to exempt it.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.716" offset="504310">The bankruptcy code and rules require debtors who wish to exempt certain property, from their estates to fill out a form, that form is known as a Schedule C and on that form they must provide certain information about their exemption and the property to which the exemption applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.548" offset="591663">The dispute in this case arose because it is possible to read the information on Reilly's Schedule C form in one of two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.099" offset="633772">Either as a claim to exempt the entire value of her cooking equipment which would be objectionable because the equipment's total value exceeds the dollar amount that the code allows for exemptions in such assets or it could be read as a claim to exempt only an interest in the equipment worth a certain dollar amount within the code’s limits, which would then be proper and therefore unobjectionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.992" offset="757384">The bankruptcy code provisions that Reilly cited on her Schedule C, entitled her to exempt an interest in her cooking equipment, not to exceed a certain dollar amount because Reilly Schedule C expressly listed the value of the claimed exemption as a specific dollar amount below the code’s limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.941" offset="849230">Schwab did not object to the exemption before he asked the bankruptcy Court for permission to sell the cooking equipment, so that he could pay Reilly the amount of her exemption and distribute the equipment's remaining value to Reilly’s creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.550" offset="919656">Reilly object into the proposed sale on the grounds that Schwab should have read her Schedule as a claim to exempt the equipment in its entirety even though its appraised value exceeded the code’s exempted limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.515" offset="1015474">The District Court agreed with Reilly and held that Schwab’s failure to make a timely objection entitled her to keep the equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.955" offset="1057270">Court of Appeals affirmed citing this Court’s 1991 decision in Taylor versus Freeland, that the deadline for bankruptcy objections must be strictly enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.938" offset="1113172">In an opinion on file with the clerk today we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, a better Schedule C entries must be read in light of the code, the bankruptcy code provisions that govern the exemptions set forth in the Schedule and code’s requirement must control over a debtor’s intent or a standalone reading of the Schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.379" offset="1218915">In this case, the code provisions that govern Reilly’s exemptions define the property that she claimed exempt as an interest in her cooking equipment, not as a equipment itself, and place a specific dollar limit on the value of that interest because the dollar value Reilly assigned the interest on Schedule C was below the code’s specified limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.983" offset="1329361">Schwab was entitled to treat her claim as a valid exemption in the amount she listed and thus did not have to object to the claim, in order to preserve for the estate, the value in the equipment beyond that amount because Reilly’s claimed the exemption in the equipment was not objectionable, neither Bankruptcy Rule 4003’s deadline for making objections, nor our Taylor decision, if in enforcing that deadline applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.518" offset="1467496">Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Justice Breyer have joined.</text>
