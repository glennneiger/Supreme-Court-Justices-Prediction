            <text syncTime="11.305" offset="151636">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.304" offset="171698">For well over a century this Court has recognized the importance of the attorney-client privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.802" offset="193640">In Hunt v. Blackburn in 1888, the Court clearly stated that the seal of secrecy upon communications between client and attorney is founded upon the necessity, in the interest of justice, that the aid and advice of persons having knowledge and skill in the practice of law provide that advice in a manner that is safely and readily available and, importantly, free from the consequences or apprehension of disclosure.</text>

            <text syncTime="53.556" offset="320700">Mr. Allen, except for the fact that you and I are lawyers, do you really think that the -- that confidentiality right is any more important to the proper functioning of society than, let's say, the protection of trade secrets?</text>
            <text syncTime="71.814" offset="393738">So that in a case of discovery where the defendant says, if I produce this I would be giving up a trade secret and it's not necessary for the case, and the judge says no, turn it over -- would there be in your view a right to interlocutory appeal in that case?</text>
            <text syncTime="92.115" offset="474927">And if not there, then why here?</text>

            <label>Mr. Randall L.  Allen</label>
            <text syncTime="93.539" offset="480569">Justice Scalia, there are -- there are several answers to the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.364" offset="503871">Let me start, first, with the -- the issue of the importance of -- of the attorney-client privilege as a key and central element of the administration of justice that this Court has recognized, not just with Hunt, but in a number of cases since.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.028" offset="566565">But the question I think also goes more to prong three of Cohen, which is the reviewability standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.183" offset="591224">In the context of attorney-client privileged information, once that information is disclosed to your adversary, it is disclosed to the last person on earth you might want to see it.</text>

            <text syncTime="150.203" offset="707208">--Your Honor, we do not argue that -- here, that there should be an interlocutory appeal for trade secrets.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.604" offset="728837">I think the practical resolution to the trade secret question is present in most cases of commercial litigation, where the court would provide a protective order limiting access to the trade secret; in other words, limiting access to counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="171.302" offset="791636">But what if the court doesn't, as Justice Scalia has posited?</text>
            <text syncTime="176.329" offset="811802">The court here could do the same thing, depending on the secret being disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.906" offset="834058">It could set up any number of protective mechanisms.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.609" offset="844925">The issue is broader than that, which is: Why is the public policy of anti-disclosure any more important in the attorney-client privilege than in the trade secret context?</text>

            <text syncTime="201.147" offset="911067">But, with regard to the attorney-client privilege, first on the issue of the protective order, the protective order cannot limit the adversary's counsel from seeing the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.346" offset="947848">As I said earlier, I think that's the last person in the world you would want to see.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.267" offset="959551">You could limit access to trade secrets to counsel, who could make no use of the Coca-Cola formula or -- or Colonel Sanders' chicken recipe, but -- but the--</text>

            <text syncTime="249.732" offset="1105418">If that is the purpose, the very existence of exceptions infringes that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.840" offset="1133840">The minute you create an exception, you are placing some sort of limitation to the frank and open discussion that you are permitting, so the damage is already done.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.614" offset="1188906">The further disclosure doesn't really serve the purpose -- or help the purpose in any meaningful way.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.627" offset="1220984">The fact that an erroneous decision on attorney-client disclosure is not going to stop people from talking to lawyers if they really need to and they are staying within the rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="298.179" offset="1299143">I think the point is that the incremental erosion of the rule is going to lessen the value of the privilege.</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="306.131" offset="1331012">Well -- but that's what I'm trying to figure out, because you are positing that erroneous decisions on disclosures are being made routinely by the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.609" offset="1372912">Assuming, as I do, that there are some erroneous disclosures, but that that's not necessarily the majority, why is there an incremental erosion significant enough to overcome our interests in the finality rule?</text>

            <text syncTime="333.103" offset="1438845">--Your Honor, I don't think we suggest that -- that erroneous orders on privilege are occurring routinely.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.100" offset="1462878">Certainly, we have suggested they occurred in this case and that they happened in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.976" offset="1482313">But I think the more direct answer to your question goes to the Court's holding in Upjohn.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.768" offset="1509480">One of the things that Upjohn points out is that what is necessary -- and I think the Court makes a similar observation in Swidler &amp; Berlin, that one of the things that's necessary for the privilege to have effect is predictability.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.856" offset="1569876">If -- if there is no predictability, then you fall back to the apprehension or the worry of disclosure that is observed in Hunt.</text>

            <text syncTime="375.834" offset="1609791">Let's talk about predictability.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.570" offset="1616687">Once you make an exception for waiver, there is already that limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.160" offset="1635077">It's not absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.879" offset="1641974">Maybe it can be waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.566" offset="1652736">Secondly, you have to worry about a district court finding it to have been waived, even though it really wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.219" offset="1687322">That's another point of doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.468" offset="1700279">And, thirdly, you have to worry about the Supreme Court affirming a district court that wrongly found it to have been waived because we give, you know, weight to the fact-finding of the -- of the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.506" offset="1764436">Once you -- once you factor in all of those uncertainties, you are not talking about a -- you know, about a fail-safe privilege at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.173" offset="1803097">There are those doubts, and I'm not sure the doubts are increased enormously, by simply saying a district court may make a mistake without -- without your being able to go up to the court of appeals on that mistake.</text>

            <text syncTime="543.439" offset="2280197">It would appear that the reasoning would be that this -- that a decision in this case is not likely to materially advance the ultimate determination of the litigation, so, therefore, I think 1292(b) would not be applicable in the ordinary case to a -- to a ruling finding waiver of the attorney-client privilege.</text>

            <text syncTime="1305.539" offset="5328583">But -- but in order to get to -- to the position we advocate, the Court must pass that threshold and establish importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.226" offset="5355332">If the Court reaches that conclusion it is certainly likely that the importance test in other existence-of privilege cases, for example, would obtain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.345" offset="5403815">I -- I don't think that compels the conclusion that any case addressing privilege must therefore be permitted collateral order jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1341.776" offset="5473510">Certainly crime fraud exception might present a difficulty with prong two of the Cohen analysis, which has to do with the separability of the issue on appeal for merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.832" offset="5517814">So it may well be that in crime fraud cases there is not sufficient separability of the issue from the merits and therefore collateral order jurisdiction would not obtain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.736" offset="5557415">As I mentioned earlier, I think we are in agreement that orders that deny the disclosure of information would not be immediately appealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.699" offset="5597226">So there are -- there are a number of instances that this Court might find in what I'll call general privilege cases that might not obtain, and it's the course that the Court has taken in other sort of general areas of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.364" offset="5659920">For example, in the attorney disqualification cases, the Court started off in Firestone finding that orders denying disqualification did not satisfy collateral order jurisdiction and it limited its holdings to -- to that instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.545" offset="5728674">In Flanagan it took up the question of whether or not collateral order jurisdiction obtained in disqualification cases and criminal cases, and in Richardson-Merrell in civil cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.322" offset="5771724">So the Court has traditionally taken, if you will, the facts of the case presented to them and limited its rulings to the facts of those cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1563.776" offset="6361569">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: Before 1997, no circuit held that there was appeal as of right for privilege or waiver, and most of the circuits continue that approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.848" offset="6413814">That is the right approach because attorney-client privilege cases do not fit the parameters of the Cohen appealability and there are alternative responses that are available on the remedial side.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.467" offset="6460312">In terms of the Cohen factors, the factor of importance which has just been discussed here, this Court has over the 60 years of some 30 opinions refined the importance test and moved it away from the questions of place, shape of litigation, dynamics of litigation, to a very narrow set of cases in which a government is typically a party or a government official, and there is a very significant either constitutional or statutory question principally of immunity from suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1648.864" offset="6701892">And I think it's important that we understand from the presence of them that this is a rule that is appropriate for lawyers on all sides of the fence, because the immediate availability of appeal as a right stops in the tracks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.017" offset="6754555">The case was decided at the district court in October of 2007 and, holding aside these proceedings, it was August of 2008 when the Eleventh Circuit rejected the mandamus and the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.309" offset="6799694">So the wisdom of the final judgment rule is precisely because the cost and delay, particularly in the area of discovery and evidentiary privileges, is so significant given that there are so many of these.</text>

            <text syncTime="2028.209" offset="8219293">Well, Cohen involved the major question of the application of the Erie principle in 1949 involving a state -- the right of security for expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.828" offset="8261716">And I would take Cohen and the Vale case and the drugging case of Sell as instances in which, is the litigant, during the pendency of the case, going to be economically secure or free, or drugged or not drugged, as distinct qualities which are all framed in either State law or Constitutional premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.553" offset="8344680">If we look over the course of the 60 years, the category is not neat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.912" offset="8362130">But the turning point is in 1978 with the Coopers opinion which says death knell, which says strategic interactions, the shape of class actions, is not available for appeal as a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.205" offset="8411240">In 1994, one might have thought of the digital case that a contract not to continue by -- just settle would have been within the set, but the Court said, no, that kind of private contractual interest is not sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.292" offset="8467560">And in 2006, in the Will case, the court narrowed it again by saying the res judicata sequence is insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.883" offset="8493996">So in the last decade the Cohen cases have come down to basically qualified immunity or Constitutionally-freighted -- structural or almost abstract, not interpersonal dynamics of the litigation, including contractual relationships or evidentiary privileges.</text>

            <text syncTime="2317.923" offset="9378085">I know of no one of the Erie cases in which the interlocutory appellate question turns on the question of state law as a predicate, and the D.C.

            <text syncTime="2331.322" offset="9431688">It's -- that's the D.C. circuit's rule for -- and indeed, it had several of these, not very many, but a few of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.943" offset="9466169">So then 502 has just come with the workings of the judicial conference and the Congress together, and the lawyers, to shape a rule that is very protective of inadvertent waiver, protective about its sequential impacts as well, and articulating and Federalizing that area of law, as well as providing under 502(a) for -- if you waive in the course of a Federal proceeding, 502 organizes the way a district court should think about it.</text>
