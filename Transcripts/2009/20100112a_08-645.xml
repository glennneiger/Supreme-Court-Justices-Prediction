            <text syncTime="7.511" offset="136485">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Hague Convention exists to ensure that custody disputes are resolved by the courts of the country of habitual residence rather than through abduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.866" offset="181938">It thus generally requires the return of a child who is abducted in violation of a right of custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.316" offset="207747">So too, a ne exeat right permits a parent to require that the child reside in the country of habitual residence, thereby rendering international abduction illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.579" offset="248811">Ne exeat rights are not only rights of custody under the text of the convention, but they also track the convention's vital purpose of ensuring that children are not subject to international abduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.151" offset="291025">Under the convention, Mrs. Abbott cannot evade the jurisdiction of the Chilean courts by abducting the child to Texas and then asking a Texas State court to nullify the rights granted to Mr. Abbott under Chilean law.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.304" offset="343688">That's the sound view of the great majority of signatory courts to consider the issue as well as essential authorities in both the United States and Chile.</text>

            <text syncTime="79.605" offset="424876">You -- you said the whole question is deferring to the courts of habitual residence, but this statute is not raised in terms of court jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="116.288" offset="571580">The fact that he also has this right under the order is -- is irrelevant for this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="136.261" offset="651515">The judge says, the man is completely at fault here, a real rotter.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.601" offset="680876">The woman is 100 percent entitled to every possible bit of custody, and the man can see the child twice a year on Christmas Day at 4:00 in the morning.</text>

            <text syncTime="3391.978" offset="13674392">With regard to the child support, there was an ordinary dispute over the amount of child support that's not addressed in the record and which was finally resolved and which Mr. Abbott paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.772" offset="13709500">The question of criminal charges -- we are not aware on any charges pending in Chile.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.598" offset="13724860">Mr. Abbott has no intent to bring such charges if Mr. Abbott -- if Mrs. Abbott returns to Chile.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.644" offset="13745027">And with regard to article 13 and the question about the child's age, article 13 is discretionary rather than mandatory, so all that the court in the United States would be doing would be to send the child back so that the courts there could resolve the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.558" offset="13804690">Turning to the -- the issues about -- the question of both "determining" and "the place of residence".</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.354" offset="13827887">As, Justice Alito, you alluded, this is an international convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.664" offset="13841053">The convention doesn't care if Mrs. Abbott moved with the child from one address in Chile to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.067" offset="13866757">The convention cares very much when a child is abducted from one country to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.409" offset="13888073">And as regards the definition of residence, it's not defined in article 5(a), but it also appears in article 5(b), which refers to rights of access.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.408" offset="13928093">It refers to the right to take the child to a place other than the child's habitual residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.888" offset="13945960">And the drafting history on this point makes quite clear that this refers not only to the right to take -- take the child from the home, but to the right to take the child out of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.354" offset="13987861">In the convention context, the word Mrs. Abbott would attribute to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.474" offset="14020357">The convention contemplates that rights will be held jointly and requires parents to work collaboratively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.330" offset="14043763">So in this case, the Abbotts, by virtue of the ne exeat right, by virtue of the ne exeat statute, had a shared, enforceable right to determine whether their child would remain in Chile or would move somewhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.921" offset="14094127">And despite what Mr. Hays has argued and has argued in his brief, it is a substantive right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.668" offset="14113144">The parent who holds the right has the right to ensure that his child remains in the country of habitual residence, which has huge implications for the language and culture in which the child will be raised, and it ensures that the courts of Chile can resolve any disputes relating to the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.036" offset="14174584">It's certainly not a mere enforcement mechanism for Mr. Abbott's access right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.598" offset="14192870">With regard to the question of whether or not Mr. Abbott needed to have care and control of the child to invoke rights of custody, article 5(a) of the convention is what defines rights of custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.748" offset="14241458">There is nothing in the text of that statute that requires the person invoking the convention to have physical care of the child.</text>
