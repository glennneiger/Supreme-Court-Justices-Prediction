            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">We will hear argument this afternoon in Case 138 in our original docket, South Carolina v. North Carolina.</text>

            <text syncTime="8.572" offset="138721">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: South Carolina seeks an equitable apportionment with North Carolina of the Catawba River.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.180" offset="177068">Both States act as parens patriae on behalf of all users of the river within their boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.674" offset="207057">For three reasons, this Court should not adopt the Special Master's recommendation that Charlotte, Duke, and the Catawba River Water Supply Project be permitted to intervene as parties in this original action: First, the report articulates the wrong legal test for intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.888" offset="283961">Second, under the New Jersey v. New York standard, none of the three entities should be permitted to intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.196" offset="313219">And, third, the report's approach to intervention involves this Court in deciding intramural disputes between and among water users in one State.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.392" offset="362015">With respect to the first point, the Special Master applied the wrong factors, we would submit, in deciding whether or not a party or an intervenor should be allowed to intervene as a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.844" offset="411752">The Special Master sought to distill from this Court's cases three principles that we would submit are not the appropriate principles in deciding an intervenor's status.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.618" offset="454907">First, the report overemphasizes the, quote, "direct stake", although the master found that the equitable apportionment had no specific impact on individual users of the water.</text>

            <text syncTime="101.037" offset="508510">I thought your friends agreed that the New Jersey v. New York standard applied?</text>

            <label>Mr. David C. Frederick</label>
            <text syncTime="105.220" offset="525228">Your Honor, part of what you will be deciding in this case is the appropriate standard for intervention, and the Special Master, we respectfully submit, did not apply the New Jersey v. New York factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.152" offset="577055">Instead, the report distilled from other cases, not the New Jersey v. New York case, the principles that she thought should apply to govern an intervenor's status, and those three principles, we would submit, are incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.334" offset="633689">Under the New Jersey v. New York standard, the master did not make findings that would be appropriate to determine the intervenor status here as appropriate parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.000" offset="680396">There was no finding of inadequate representation by either State to support any of the intervenor's request to participate as parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.998" offset="716340">There was no finding of a compelling interest in the sense that it was truly compelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.464" offset="738283">It's hard to argue in cases in -- where there is no case from this Court in the equitable apportionment area that three intervenors would have met the compelling interest standard here.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.286" offset="789588">And, finally, the New York-New Jersey standard talks about having interests that are apart from other interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.520" offset="826472">But both Charlotte and the Catawba River Water Supply Project are simply acting on behalf of all users of North Carolina water.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.095" offset="860745">They simply happen to be the largest ones.</text>

            <text syncTime="191.669" offset="871090">Mr. Frederick, we -- we had a case involving, what, a tax on -- on oil companies, in which it was a State against State case, but we allowed the oil companies who would pay the tax to intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.958" offset="952278">Now, why is that any different from this case?</text>

            <label>Mr. David C. Frederick</label>
            <text syncTime="222.191" offset="993134">--This Court has said for 200 years that water is a unique resource within the sovereign control of States.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.813" offset="1015599">In the Maryland case, the Court permitted intervention in a situation in which Louisiana had sued the pipeline companies in Louisiana State court for a declaratory judgment that its tax was constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.009" offset="1076412">There was also a pending FERC action in Federal court in Louisiana raising the same issue, so when Maryland and eight other States who were not parens patriae of the various pipeline companies who sought to intervene filed the original action, I think the Court appropriately considered that interests of judicial efficiency called for handling the Commerce Clause challenge in the original action in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.374" offset="1181842">And finally, the Court only devoted two sentences of its opinion and didn't cite the New Jersey v. -- New York v. New Jersey case in acting on the intervention.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="280.776" offset="1227504">Yes, well, these -- these are rules that we are making up ourselves, right, as to when we are going to allow intervention or not?</text>
            <text syncTime="287.413" offset="1254045">Do -- is there any case -- I think there isn't, but tell me if I'm wrong -- is there any case in which we have rejected intervention that has been recommended by the Special Master?</text>

            <text syncTime="300.719" offset="1307230">I don't think I can recall a case in that factual scenario, but I can point you to Kentucky v. Indiana in 1930, in which this Court rejected Kentucky's attempt to join individual Indiana citizens as parties in an original action over Indiana's alleged breach of a contract to build an interstate bridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.197" offset="1393225">And the reason--</text>

            <text syncTime="322.914" offset="1396046">I understand your basic argument that each State should represent its own constituents.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.194" offset="1417153">But isn't the Catawba River Water Supply Project in a different category?</text>
            <text syncTime="334.379" offset="1441917">Because it straddles both States, and I think it can reasonably fear that it would be treated as a stepchild by both States.</text>

            <text syncTime="341.703" offset="1471175">--No, in fact, Mr. Chief Justice, I would submit they have the weakest claim to intervention in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.263" offset="1493431">Their argument, fundamentally, is that Union County, North Carolina, which is the North Carolina part of the joint venture with the Lancaster Water District, should be permitted to have water purchased from the South Carolina side of the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.194" offset="1553199">So what's happening with that water project is the water is sucked out on the South Carolina side and piped north for Union County's consumption under a Union County permit with the State of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.219" offset="1605235">Union County, therefore, is acting as any other user of water, along with Charlotte and all other users of water in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.293" offset="1641597">The Catawba Project is not here to intervene to protect its interests on the South Carolina side of the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.371" offset="1665839">Those are adequately protected, we submit, by the attorney general acting on behalf of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.209" offset="1689245">So in effect the Union County, North Carolina, claim here of 5 million gallons of water per day which they are seeking to protect through their intervention is no different than the other interests of North Carolina water users that they are seeking to protect--</text>

            <text syncTime="455.627" offset="1926855">And these three entities account for a very large proportion of those interbasin transfers.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.156" offset="1949006">Isn't it the case that any -- any decision by -- by this Court on -- on this question will necessarily impact directly these three entities?</text>

            <text syncTime="490.686" offset="2067184">I understand that, but I'm talking about the real world.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.781" offset="2075544">If -- if indeed North Carolina has to cut back, and if indeed the opinion of this Court says that it's taking too much because of interbasin transfers, as a practical matter these three entities are going to be out of luck.</text>

            <text syncTime="615.623" offset="2566855">First, in any appellate review Situation, this Court would review de novo the legal test that would be applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="634.520" offset="2642505">But secondly, the Court has said in numerous original cases it does not apply deference, although it gives appropriate respect to special masters, and so there would be no basis for applying a deference standard to a special master ruling on a question of law that fundamentally is about what this Court's original jurisdiction under Article III is supposed to be about.</text>

            <text syncTime="2950.869" offset="11907824">The first question dealt with Maryland v. Louisiana, and Mr. Frederick responded that that case, in which 17 pipeline companies were permitted to intervene -- according to Mr. Frederick, the States in that case did not serve as parens patriae with regard to those 17 pipeline companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.613" offset="11986819">That is factually incorrect.</text>
