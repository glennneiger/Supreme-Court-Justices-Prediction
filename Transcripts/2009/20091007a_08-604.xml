            <text syncTime="210.490" offset="947346">I would urge the Court to look at the board's decision in this case, and one of the five appears at pages 65 -- 65a to 72a of the petition appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.734" offset="988306">The relevant reasoning starts on 68a to 71a.</text>

            <text syncTime="247.798" offset="1096662">Well, what are those requirements?</text>
            <text syncTime="249.736" offset="1104394">Section 301.2(b) of circular 1 expressly says that, quote:</text>

            <text syncTime="1640.591" offset="6667745">We never received an interpretation of the contract, and by that I mean the contract in any aspect -- procedural rules of the contract, substantive rules of the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="1655.523" offset="6727513">And the reason that the Respondent urged both a statutory and due process violation is that without any interpretation of the contract, these five cases were dismissed invoking Circular 1, Code of Federal Regulations, as the basis, and denying these five engineers any determination of their contract claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.274" offset="6842556">They never got to what the Railway Labor Act with its mandatory arbitration procedure promised the engineers and the carriers: a resolution of their contract claims for the purpose of industrial peace.</text>

            <text syncTime="3513.061" offset="14157678">The difference, Your Honor, I believe, is that in the ordinary arbitral context when you have a procedural question, the question is what the parties would have wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.247" offset="14190383">Here the question is what Congress would have wanted, but there is no -- about the correct standards of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.257" offset="14210445">But there is no reason to think that Congress wanted anything other than what the parties ordinarily want under this case law, which is for procedural questions to be resolved by the arbitrator.</text>

            <text syncTime="3573.395" offset="14399049">That -- that's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.490" offset="14403333">The statute in section 2 Second requires a conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.972" offset="14417335">And Respondents argued initially in this case that the statute shouldn't be read that way and there should be an exception read in from section 2 Sixth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.467" offset="14447323">That was rejected by the district court and they chose not to appeal it to the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.265" offset="14462474">It's not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.357" offset="14466863">Now, Respondent focuses a lot on section 301.5 in its language about argumentative facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.105" offset="14489851">I think that our interpretation here today of that language isn't ultimately the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.117" offset="14517854">That this is a question for the arbitrators to resolve unless -- even if a court is convinced that the arbitrators committed serious error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.722" offset="14544290">But the more important maybe threshold point is that the arbitrators didn't say that they were resting their opinion just on section 301.5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.550" offset="14571666">They never invoked section 301.5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.953" offset="14581279">They said circular one and the weight of precedent under the arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.873" offset="14600923">And if this Court looks at section 301.2(a), which requires the parties to include all facts relevant to the dispute in their initial submissions, I think that resolves the question.</text>
