            <text syncTime="9.706" offset="144238">Ten years ago, in Section 48 of Title 18, Congress crafted a narrowly targeted restriction against certain depictions of actual animal cruelty.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.228" offset="178301">Yet the Third Circuit struck the statute down on its face without even attempting to apply substantial overbreadth analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.031" offset="205573">The statute has four critical features and, just as the Court last year in United States v. Williams began with statutory construction, analysis should begin there.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.137" offset="241936">First, like the statute at issue in the United States v. Ferber, this statute only reaches depictions of cruelty to actual living beings -- animals, not simulated ones or the written word.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.695" offset="288225">Second, the statute only applies to commercial messages, ones that Congress found drove the market for animal cruelty.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.783" offset="316541">Third, the statute examines the work as a whole--</text>

            <text syncTime="85.153" offset="446004">What evidence was there that, for example, dog fighting had as large and robust a market or that hunting videos in those States in which hunting was illegal had a robust market, et cetera?</text>

            <label>Mr. Neal Kumar Katyal</label>
            <text syncTime="100.930" offset="509116">Well, hunting we think is excluded, and I could talk about that in a moment, from the reach of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.381" offset="526984">Congress spoke in general terms, and I don't think that Mr. Stevens's statement at page 13 of his merits brief, which is to the effect that Congress repeatedly disavowed any attempt to regulate animal fighting -- dog fighting -- I don't think that is correct and the record does not support that.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.409" offset="595007">Congress spoke in general terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.009" offset="601485">They had a for-profit commercial market about animal cruelty, and the statute dealt with it in general terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.996" offset="629384">And they reasoned that by -- by punishing the sale of these videotapes, they would get at the underlying clandestine market--</text>

            <text syncTime="146.122" offset="689883">And the Third Circuit's decision in this case struck down the statute with respect to crush videos, with respect to the sale of video -- the creation of dog fighting videotapes, because, remember, the statute, Section 48, doesn't just encompass the -- the sale of videotapes.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.848" offset="752786">It also encompasses the creation of dog fighting videotapes.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.817" offset="764698">And, yet, the -- the Third Circuit struck that down as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.769" offset="776505">That, I think, was a fundamental error under this Court's principles, most particularly, United States v. Williams, which says that the statute should only be struck down if there is a substantial -- if there is substantial overbreadth and only if it is a last resort of the Court, not the first.</text>

            <text syncTime="220.671" offset="988097">In Ferber, the Court -- the Court dealt, as modified or as glossed by your decision in Free Speech Coalition, because what Ferber and Free Speech Coalition together say is that Congress was not -- or the legislature, was not targeting the contents of a depiction; rather, it was trying to get at and dry up the underlying market, child exploitation in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="243.102" offset="1077854">Mr. Katyal, the Court summarily dealt with a case some years ago, American Booksellers v. Hudnut, where cities attempted to make not even a criminal offense, but the subject of a civil suit, a violent depiction -- depictions of women as sexual objects enjoying pain and humiliation and degradation.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.855" offset="1200839">The Seventh Circuit said that that was a blatant violation of the First Amendment, to go after purveyors who show these women in the shocking, degrading photographs, and I believe we summarily affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="370.602" offset="1587869">And so they exempted educational depictions, religious, and so on, because that wasn't what was driving the underlying market for crush videos--</text>
