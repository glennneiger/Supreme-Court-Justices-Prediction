            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="7.601" offset="136798">First of the decisions I will announce is number 08-1394 Skilling v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.316" offset="171698">In 2001, Enron Corporation, then one of the world's leading energy companies crashed into bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.574" offset="212762">This opinion considers two questions arising from the prosecution of Jeffrey Skilling, a longtime top Enron Executive, for crimes committed before the corporation's collapse.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.563" offset="272739">First, did pretrial publicity and community prejudice prevent Skilling from obtaining the fair trial of the Sixth Amendment guarantees and second, was Skilling properly charged with and convicted of conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.969" offset="354346">The Fifth Circuit answering no to the first question and yes to the second, affirmed Skilling's convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.161" offset="387051">We agree with the Fifth Circuit's ruling on Skilling's fair trial claim, but we disagree with that court’s opinion on Skilling's honest services conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.385" offset="431982">We therefore affirm in part and vacate in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.998" offset="446401">On the fair trial issue, Skilling argues that his prosecution never should have proceeded in Houston, Enron's home base.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.843" offset="485794">Pointing to the heavy media coverage and the community outrage attending Enron's collapse, he urges this Court to presume that prejudice infected his jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.793" offset="533650">Critical differences, however, separate Skilling's trial from those in which we have presumed juror prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.587" offset="568759">First in contrast to the small-town settings at issue in prior cases, Houston is the fourth most populous city in the nation, the suggestion that 12 impartial jurors could not be found there is hard to sustain.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.153" offset="635005">Second, news stories about Skilling reported no smoking gun evidence, nothing comparable to the murder confessions broadcast in prior cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.582" offset="684743">Third, media attention diminished somewhat in the four years between Enron's collapse and Skilling’s trial and finally Skilling's jury acquitted him of nine insider trading charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.241" offset="739391">Those not guilty verdicts hardly suggested jury incapable of weighing the evidence impartially.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.939" offset="770215">We conclude in short that no presumption of prejudice should have disqualified Houston as a place appropriate for Skilling's trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.080" offset="802816">We further hold that no actual prejudice contaminated Skilling's jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.467" offset="824341">The jury selection process, we are satisfied, adequately detected and defused potential juror bias.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.897" offset="857987">The District Court initially screened venire members by using a comprehensive questionnaire drafted in large part by Skilling’s counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.620" offset="904903">That 77-question, 14-page document was designed to probe potential jurors’ exposure to pretrial publicity and their opinions about Enron and Skilling.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.920" offset="954117">During voir dire the court questioned each venire member individually, focusing on questionnaire answers that raised a red flag signaling possible bias.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.478" offset="1004377">Once done, the Court allowed counsel to ask follow-up questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.963" offset="1022245">Careful consideration of the questionnaires and voir dire of the seated jurors satisfies us that the fact triers in Skilling’s case were largely uninterested in and personally untouched by Enron's collapse.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.645" offset="1081072">Accordingly we reject Skilling's claim that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to trial by an impartial jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.358" offset="1111897">We next consider whether Skilling was improperly convicted of conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.574" offset="1140736">To understand how honest services fraud works, consider the following example.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.941" offset="1166232">A mayor accepts a bribe from a third party in exchange for awarding that party a city contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.973" offset="1202385">If the contract terms are the same as any that could have been negotiated at arm's length, the city suffers no tangible loss of money or property, but the citizens are harmed because they have been deprived of their right to the Mayor’s honest services.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.558" offset="1276677">Beginning in the 1940s, the Court of Appeals one after the other upheld fraud convictions of both public and private employees based on facts resembling those in the bribed Mayor's example.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.980" offset="1334356">By 1982, all Federal appellate courts had embraced the honest services theory of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.321" offset="1363717">In 1987, this Court’s decision in McNally v. United States blew the whistle on honest services prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.251" offset="1399453">The mail and wire fraud statutes, we held, proscribed only deprivations of money or property not honest services.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.029" offset="1438532">The next year Congress enacted 18 U.S.C. 1346 to override McNally.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.555" offset="1464654">That statute provides that the term scheme or artifice to defraud are used -- as used in the mail and wire fraud proscriptions, includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.776" offset="1537588">Skilling contends that the Honest Services statute is unconstitutionally vague and therefore violates due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.222" offset="1571338">His vagueness challenge we acknowledge has force.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.406" offset="1588057">No doubt Congress intended Section 1346 to reinstate pre-McNally honest services' decisions, but those decisions are hardly models of clarity or consistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.695" offset="1641242">Nevertheless, the Court must, if possible, salvage not condemn Congress’ enactments.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.189" offset="1671231">Section 1346, we conclude, is amenable to a reasonably confined construction, one that limits the statute scope to the paradigm pre-McNally cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.378" offset="1719923">The vast majority of the pre-McNally honest services prosecutions involved offenders who in violation of a fiduciary duty participated in bribery or kickback schemes.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.314" offset="1775720">Indeed McNally itself, the case which spurred Congress to enact 1346, presented a classic kickback scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.811" offset="1813650">Beyond doubt, Congress intended 1346 to reach at least bribes and kickbacks engineered by persons in positions of trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.962" offset="1854297">Leaving the statute to proscribe a wider range of offensive conduct, we acknowledge, would raise due process concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.422" offset="1892122">To save the statute of running afoul of constitutional limitations, we now hold that Section 1346 criminalizes only the bribe and kickback hoar of the pre-McNally case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.468" offset="1948338">Because Skilling's misconduct entailed no bribe or kickback, he did not conspire to commit honest services fraud under our confined construction of 1346.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.637" offset="1997030">We leave for remand the question whether the error is harmless in light of other theories supportive of Skilling’s conspiracy conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.120" offset="2034960">Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment in which Justices Kennedy and Thomas join.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.653" offset="2069023">Justice Alito has also find -- filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.652" offset="2097027">Justice Sotomayor has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which Justices Stevens and Breyer join.</text>
