            <text syncTime="10.292" offset="146536">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress enacted the PMPA to regulate two specific, but important, actions: Franchisors' termination of the franchise prior to the conclusion of the franchise term and the franchisors' non-renewal of the franchise relationship at the end of the agreement's term.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.205" offset="222292">The statute responded to complaints about franchisors exercising broad contractual rights to terminate the franchise relationship that was not addressed by -- for trivial violations or at will, that was not previously addressed by State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.824" offset="280701">But Congress left all other aspects of the franchise relationship to State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.448" offset="299196">Because the term "terminate", at the very least, requires an end, we and the United States agree that the First Circuit erred in upholding a so-called constructive termination, where the dealers continued to receive each element of the statutory franchise -- that is the premises, the trademark, and fuel--</text>

            <text syncTime="108.735" offset="540359">The term "constructive eviction" we would -- we believe does exist, along with "constructive discharge".</text>
            <text syncTime="113.419" offset="559062">But the precise terms that Congress used here were U.C.C., in particular, and from State franchise statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="124.587" offset="603784">But that -- on that point, the government differs with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.100" offset="617785">The government says, as Justice Scalia suggested, there can be such a thing as constructive termination, and you must terminate.</text>

            <text syncTime="138.800" offset="660626">It's not so much that we differ; it's that our fallback position is the same as the government's, but they do not endorse our primary position, which is that there is no such thing as constructive termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.734" offset="696362">We believe it would be a mistake to recognize constructive termination in this context for three reasons: The first is the one I already mentioned, is that, in the most analogous context that existed at the time Congress acted, State franchise statutes that used terms like "terminate", "non-renew", "cancel", the terms that Congress used, there was -- the notion of constructive termination was frankly unheard of.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.506" offset="783402">Even today, under those statutes it is not a well-accepted concept, having been rejected by approximately half the States to have considered it.</text>

            <text syncTime="195.196" offset="886220">It's not so much -- there isn't a mitigation of damages, any more than an employee claiming constructive discharge, for example, would be mitigating damages by staying in her job.</text>

            <text syncTime="215.233" offset="966363">That is the nature, even where constructive discharge and constructive termination -- constructive eviction claims, are recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.981" offset="989351">That is the settled rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.902" offset="993008">If you have something else, for example, there's a breach of contract, you can claim your breach of contract, and you can sue for damages while continuing to operate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2239.178" offset="9062128">But then when the Marcoux or the Mac's Shell case was re-filed, it's correct that the dealers did not initially move for injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.581" offset="9087728">And I think there were two reasons for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.035" offset="9093580">Number one, it was always contemplated with Judge Zobel that this matter would proceed on an expedited basis, that discovery would lead to trial within a very short period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.232" offset="9134331">And, number two, even though there is a relaxed standard for injunctive relief, it was not clear that the dealers would be able to sufficiently meet their burden of proof to demonstrate to the court that an injunction should be issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.276" offset="9178530">Again, we are dealing here in a practical effect of asking an oil company on a national basis to be enjoined from implementing this change in rent that they had brought about.</text>

            <text syncTime="2601.574" offset="10511715">So, again, to the extent that the -- an injunction had been sought, it would have helped to preserve the status quo, and in this case, again, here, the oil company was not in any way, shape, or form harmed by the dealers' pursuit of their claim because they continued to pay their rent, for those that remained in business, and those that went out of business obviously stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.224" offset="10582350">Your Honors, if I may turn to the other claim, which is also present in this case here, the claim of the non-renewal, both the government and Shell have suggested that the statute imposes some sort of a mandatory mechanism requiring the franchisor to give notice and then the dealer seeking an injunction within 90 days in order -- in connection with the non-renewal claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.433" offset="10675137">I think, as a practical matter, we need to start with the proposition of what the jury found here, and the jury found that, in this case, the oil company added new terms to the lease specifically for the purposes of converting the franchise-operated stations to direct operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.037" offset="10733547">They wanted the dealers out of business, and they wanted to take over operations of their stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.095" offset="10753818">Had the oil company issued a notice of non-renewal when the parties didn't reach agreement on the terms of the agreement and this case had proceeded to a trial, there is no question, but that the result would have been exactly the same as the result is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.479" offset="10815363">So the question we are facing is whether or not this mechanism that they have advanced as being the -- the only way, the exclusive remedy to proceed is, in fact, such, and we would argue that, in fact, it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.912" offset="10861025">Both the government and the Solicitor have conceded already that, while the statute requires notice in the normal course, that, certainly, notice can be side-stepped, and that conduct can give rise to notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.953" offset="10909194">The next question then would be whether or not the dealer must seek injunctive relief as a prerequisite to maintaining a claim, and we argue that there is nothing in the language of the statute suggesting that the injunction is mandatory.</text>

            <text syncTime="3133.476" offset="12639336">I believe the debate in this case comes down to about three issues: The first is what is the relevant background principle we think Congress was looking to when it used the words "terminate", "non-renew", and "cancel" in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.797" offset="12692626">We think the most analogous background principles they would have been looking to were contract law and the State franchise statutes that existed at the time Congress acted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3155.355" offset="12726794">But, Mr. Lamken, isn't it true that the statute, as a whole, expressed Congress's feeling that the common law rules were really not sufficient because, under the common law, of course, they could just non-renew because they wanted to take over the franchise themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.273" offset="12782488">And under the statute, that is not permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.725" offset="12796280">So there's a major change that's created by the statute, which suggests, to me, that maybe they didn't want to adopt all the preexisting common law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3181.814" offset="12832643">There was a deficiency in the common law, but it was limited to one point, and that was termination and non-renewal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.765" offset="12856466">It wasn't that breaches of contract -- and as the government has explained, a breach of contract here is a precondition to a constructive termination claim -- were insufficiently remedied by State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.839" offset="12892724">That was not the issue before Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.508" offset="12899412">The issue before Congress was that there was a contractual right to terminate at will or for trivial reasons or to non-renew for no reason or bad reasons even, and that is what Congress regulated, was terminations and non-renewals, in that sense, not breaches of contract that turned out to be really bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.830" offset="12968688">The second thing is that because there was a comprehensive State remedy, there is particularly little reason to read this statute, this narrow statute, expansively, particularly given that this is an expressly preemptive -- a potentially conflict preemption statute, which could have the effect of displacing State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.073" offset="13037756">When you're looking at a statute that's narrowly looking at termination or non-renewal, you would not ordinarily expand those terms to include really bad breaches of contract, because that has the potential to displace State statutory and potentially State common law under the preemption clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.909" offset="13101077">And, finally, the last piece that comes up is the problem of evasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.733" offset="13112362">The issue becomes sort of, well, people can just get around this statute if there is no constructive termination cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.890" offset="13137021">And the answer to that is: There is no problem with evasion, because everything that's covered by constructive termination has to be a breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.667" offset="13172130">State law has this comprehensively covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.039" offset="13181534">Increasing the price terms on an open price term?</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.897" offset="13193028">U.C.C. 2-305, under which plaintiff's recovered here, has that covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.991" offset="13213403">So the -- extending the Federal statute really adds very little.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.488" offset="13227405">And the second point is that even under the PMPA today, constructive termination has been rejected -- every -- except in the narrow area of assignments, under the theory that an assignment followed by a breach is somehow a constructive termination, a theory which I don't think we or the government thinks makes any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.593" offset="13291771">But that's where it exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.622" offset="13295950">And yet there's no record outside the area of assignment of these grand evasions by boosting up all the prices in violation of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.402" offset="13326984">And the risk of expanding constructive termination here is it projects Federal law into deciding whether or not it's going to prohibit particular price terms, particular conditions, particular things dealing with the rent and the premises, something that Congress stayed away from and left to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.333" offset="13386752">What Congress regulated here were the narrow issues of termination and non-renewal, not the substantive content of the franchise relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.562" offset="13415696">If there are no questions, we ask that the judgment with respect to termination be reversed and the judgment with respect to non-renewal be affirmed.</text>
