            <text syncTime="64.389" offset="363959">In this case, the use at trial, obviously, was absolutely immunized under Imbler and many of this other -- this Court's other precedents.</text>

            <text syncTime="165.438" offset="768230">In other words, if we could view that prosecutor simply as an ordinary citizen, simply as a complaining witness, as analogous to a police officer, So there's no argument in this case that simply, by virtue of being a prosecutor, a prosecutor has absolute immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.513" offset="824445">The courts below wrongfully abrogated trial immunity because trial is the only place where the injury of conviction and subsequent incarceration could have taken place.</text>

            <text syncTime="3257.383" offset="13135956">I think it's actually something that would be evaluated objectively after the fact, and I think the way that this Court should approach this case is neither of the parties before you have asked this Court to overturn Buckley.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.821" offset="13177752">I wouldn't do it under those circumstances, but, of course, it's worth adding that, if you were going to overturn Buckley, then the place to probably start would be to go back to first principles, and if you're going to go back to first principles, then what you're going to find is that there was no common law support at all for absolute immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.664" offset="13241072">And I wouldn't think that this Court was particularly interested in coming up with implied immunities that aren't in the statute and had no basis at the common law, and that's why I think some of the Justices that have looked at this as an original matter have tended to be quite reluctant in recognizing absolute immunity because it lacks support in the text and it lacks support at the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.959" offset="13314320">So we're -- we're happy with the lines that this Court has already drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.077" offset="13326754">But if the Court's going to go back to first principles, well, let's go back to first principles and look at -- the at the statute Congress passed in 1871.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.100" offset="13354862">That statute did not provide any immunities, and I do think, as we say in the brief, this is a case where it's important not to lose the forest for the trees because this is a statute was passed -- passed in 1871.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.039" offset="13398643">This is one of the great civil rights statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.824" offset="13405748">Is it really plausible to think that the Congress that passed this statute didn't want to provide a remedy in the circumstances before the Court today?</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.847" offset="13437827">I think it's clear, from this Court's cases -- there may not be a case that lines up all the dots exactly, but I think it's clear, from this Court's cases, that the police officer that engages in this misconduct has committed a grave, grave constitutional violation and ought to be liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.939" offset="13498222">I think the prosecutor who engages in the pretrial misconduct and then doesn't participate in the trial is just as liable as that police officer, and I can't think of a single reason why the only reason a prosecutor would get absolute immunity is, if they not only participated in the pretrial misconduct, but completed the scheme by committing further misconduct at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.603" offset="13580873">For all those reasons, we think the Court should affirm.</text>

            <text syncTime="3468.449" offset="13980233">It would work a radical change in the law of immunity because it would mean that far more wrongful conviction claims against prosecutors would go forward under only qualified immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.173" offset="14027149">That is the inevitable consequence of affirming the courts below in this case.</text>
