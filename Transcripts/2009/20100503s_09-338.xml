            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">I have our opinion this morning in case, 09-338 Renico versus Lett.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.625" offset="128961">Every now and then juries in criminal cases are not able to agree on a verdict and when a jury is genuinely deadlocked, the trial judge may declare a mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.665" offset="169085">The jury is dismissed and the prosecutor can decide whether to try the defendant before a new jury, but the defendant has an interest in having his case decided in one prosecution so the jury must be genuinely deadlocked.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.592" offset="224778">If it is not, retrial of the defendant violates the Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.041" offset="246617">Now our cases have said that the decision whether to grant a mistrial is committed to the “sound discretion” of the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.544" offset="284651">That judge after all is on the scene and has the best perspective on the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.456" offset="304295">All a reviewing court has is a cold transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.375" offset="319969">In this case, the trial was relatively straightforward and took nine hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.373" offset="339926">The jury deliberated for four hours before sending a note, asking what if we can't agree; mistrial, retrial, what?</text>
            <text syncTime="66.922" offset="374094">The judge called the jury in and the following exchange took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.024" offset="390499">The court, I received your note asking me what if you can't agree and I have to conclude from that that is your situation at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.027" offset="426548">So I'd like to ask the fore person to identify themselves please.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.080" offset="442744">The fore person steps forward, identifies herself.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.843" offset="453820">The court, Okay, thank you, alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.300" offset="463642">I need to ask you if the jury is deadlocked?</text>
            <text syncTime="92.070" offset="474718">in other words, is there a disagreement as to the verdict?</text>
            <text syncTime="95.429" offset="488197">The fore person, Yes there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.663" offset="497079">The court, Alright, do you believe that it is hopelessly deadlocked?</text>
            <text syncTime="101.731" offset="513379">The fore person, The majority of us don't believe that.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.157" offset="527067">And the court cuts her off, don't say which you’re going to say, okay?</text>
            <text syncTime="108.413" offset="540129">The fore person, Oh!</text>
            <text syncTime="109.256" offset="543472">I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.726" offset="545353">The court, I don't want to know what your verdict might be or how the split is or any of that, thank you, okay?</text>
            <text syncTime="117.140" offset="575028">Are you going to reach an unanimous verdict or not?</text>
            <text syncTime="119.930" offset="586209">The fore person pauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.441" offset="592165">The court, Yes or no.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.267" offset="599479">The fore person, No judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.898" offset="610032">The Judge then declares a mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.964" offset="618287">The defendant was retried and found guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.804" offset="629676">He argued that the judge acted too quickly in concluding that the jury was really deadlocked.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.554" offset="652664">The State Supreme Court disagreed and upheld the trial judge's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.236" offset="671368">The defendant then sought to have the Supreme Court's ruling overturned by a federal court through a writ of Habeas Corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.708" offset="705327">But when a defendant does that, the federal court does not just start over and take a fresh look at the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.317" offset="727688">Under a law called The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act or AEDPA, the federal court may only rule for a state prisoner if the relevant state court decision was contrary to clearly established Federal law, was an unreasonable application of that law or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.663" offset="813056">So we do not decide whether the state trial judge was right.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.711" offset="829252">We do not decide whether the State Supreme Court was right when it upheld her decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.049" offset="850672">The only issue is whether the State Supreme Court decision was unreasonable and we hold it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.574" offset="880765">Here we had a jury unable to reach a verdict in four hours after trial that only lasted nine.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.187" offset="903231">You had a jury asking what happens if they don't agree and of course you had a direct statement by the fore person that the jury would not be able to reach a unanimous verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.182" offset="943146">Now the trial judge could have done more, a more thorough job of probing to make sure the jury was really deadlocked and we’re not saying that the State Supreme Court decision was right, reasonable judges can disagree about that, but we're saying that the State Supreme Court decision was not unreasonable, and therefore, we do not upset the state court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.675" offset="1029141">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Sotomayor has joined and in which Justice Breyer has joined in part.</text>
