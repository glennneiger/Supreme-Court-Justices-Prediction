            <text syncTime="165.469" offset="766286">Our argument was we recognized that Roper dealt with the death penalty as opposed to life without parole, but our argument was that the reasoning of Roper is similarly applicable to someone sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.727" offset="811321">The trial judge could not evaluate the procedural question without analyzing Roper, and that's what the trial court did.</text>

            <text syncTime="214.936" offset="964190">And what triggered this -- and this is why this is relevant to this procedural question -- was that the State of Florida did apply Roper to juveniles who had been sentenced to death after this Court's decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2761.263" offset="11149437">Justice Sotomayor, the case is Hughes v. State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.132" offset="11160931">It is cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.849" offset="11167828">It is an application of Apprendi, where the defendant does not prevail but, nonetheless, is entitled to that review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.821" offset="11195726">And I don't think there's any question in this case that, if a death row prisoner who was a juvenile was still on death row in Florida, had not sought the relief and obtained the relief that he is entitled to under Roper, he would be barred from such relief because he did not file within the 2 years.</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="2788.581" offset="11258734">You are missing the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.731" offset="11263331">What Florida says and what your adversary is saying is -- you're absolutely right, if you win under Graham, you could go under 39.a -- if you win under Graham, and Graham makes its rule retroactive, that fits right into (b)(2) directly, and so those cases you have no problems with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.094" offset="11348804">What he is saying, however, is you can't go in to Florida and ask them to announce the constitutional rule under a case where it hasn't been already held.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bryan Stevenson</label>
            <text syncTime="2822.235" offset="11393317">Well, I -- and that's what I disagree with, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.587" offset="11402721">That's exactly what the court is doing in Hughes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.120" offset="11412856">That's exactly what the court is doing in these other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.372" offset="11421842">Otherwise, a lot of this Court's rules don't have clear and direct categorical lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.674" offset="11443054">You have to apply them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.442" offset="11446188">You have to apply them in context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.742" offset="11451413">And it would mean that people whose sentences are now illegal under the law, only when applied, would be so banned, and that's what I don't think the Florida legislature or the Florida courts are saying.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2846.381" offset="11489970">And you address this in footnote 35 of your reply brief, and it would have been a little bit helpful if you had raised it initially, so that the State would have had an opportunity to reply, but you introduced the citation there with "for example", and then you cite some cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2863.593" offset="11558724">Yes -- yes, there are, Justice Alito, and -- and, again, I just want to contextualize why this is the way it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.949" offset="11588190">At no point did the State make any of these arguments in the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.817" offset="11603655">They did make it at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.934" offset="11608148">They did not make it on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.453" offset="11614208">This issue was raised for the first time in this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2880.304" offset="11625597">There are -- there are other cases in which the lower Florida courts have used -- have said that this particular subsection is appropriate for raising a constitutional challenge.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bryan Stevenson</label>
            <text syncTime="2893.295" offset="11677529">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.895" offset="11679932">There are other situations where they have made Eighth Amendment claims and analyses, and sometimes the petitioners lose; sometimes they prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.613" offset="11702815">They have done it in other contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.215" offset="11709294">And so I do think that it's quite clear, from the way Florida applies these cases, that this Court has jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2906.703" offset="11731237">I thought that in your cert petition, which I don't have with me, you raised the question of the adequate State ground in the second question.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="2929.532" offset="11822561">But there was a question that you raised, and then your opening brief doesn't discuss it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.603" offset="11842832">Your reply brief responds to the State and then brings up something in a footnote that the State doesn't have a chance to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.328" offset="11885672">That doesn't seem, to me, a very sound way to approach a question that you, yourself, raised.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bryan Stevenson</label>
            <text syncTime="2951.982" offset="11912317">--Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.482" offset="11914303">Justice Ginsburg, we read that second question to be should this Court take an interest in a case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.684" offset="11931126">Should this Court be barred?</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.802" offset="11935619">Should this Court intervene where a child of 13 has been sentenced to life without parole, and there may never be another example?</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.904" offset="11955994">He can't go to Federal habeas corpus because he is time-barred from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.556" offset="11970623">So this Court's opportunity to review the case is critical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.324" offset="11981699">That's what we thought we were raising in the second question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.025" offset="11992461">Frankly, we thought that the jurisdictional question was a question that was pretty clear -- plain on its face because the trial court's disposition of the this case was completely dependent on its interpretation of Roper, and I think that's what gives this Court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.321" offset="12053692">You have said, repeatedly, in Ohio v. Reiner, in Ake v. Oklahoma, when the analysis of a State procedural rule does depend on an assessment of the Federal law, you have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.177" offset="12097055">And I think that jurisdiction should be exercised in this case to declare that this sentence is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.914" offset="12120043">It is unquestionably unusual to have -- no child of 13 in this country sentenced to life without parole in 44 States makes it clear that this is an unusual sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.054" offset="12164660">But we also contend to say to any child of 13 that you are only fit to die in prison is cruel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.558" offset="12194649">It can't be reconciled with what we know about the nature of children, about the character of children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.046" offset="12212621">It cannot be reconciled with our standards of decency, and we believe that the Constitution obligates us to enforce those standards and reverse this judgment.</text>
