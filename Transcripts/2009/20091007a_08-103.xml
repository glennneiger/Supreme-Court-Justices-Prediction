            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">We will hear argument next in Case 08-103, Elsevier v. Muchnick.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.260" offset="126474">Mr. Sims.</text>

          <turn speaker="charles_s_sims" startTime="6.528" stopTime="43.417">
            <label>Mr. Charles S. Sims</label>
            <text syncTime="6.528" offset="131490">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="8.743" offset="140372">The Second Circuit's decision vacating for lack of jurisdiction a settlement agreement that compensated authors for all their arguably infringed works in the face of Congress's direction that Federal district courts shall have jurisdiction over any civil action arising under copyright is wrong for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.439" offset="211216">First, even -- first, the decision is incorrect under the unanimous holding three years ago in Arbaugh that where Congress affords unqualified subject matter jurisdiction, other statutory provisions argued to be jurisdictional that do not clearly restrict that jurisdiction won't be deemed to do so.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="43.417" stopTime="54.289">
            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="43.417" offset="279134">This is a lot harder case than Arbaugh, though.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.525" offset="291568">Arbaugh involved the definition of an employer and then the scope of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.290" offset="310585">This one says no suit shall be instituted.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_s_sims" startTime="54.289" stopTime="98.443">
            <label>Mr. Charles S. Sims</label>
            <text syncTime="54.289" offset="322602">Well, Arbaugh relied heavily on the Zipes case, and the Zipes involved a statutory threshold condition much like the one here.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.738" offset="352381">You couldn't bring a Title VII action unless you filed a particular kind of piece of paper with the EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.143" offset="377981">And Zipes and Arbaugh both held that those statutory conditions or essential ingredients were not jurisdictional, and the Court relied, heavily I think, on the fact that jurisdiction was separately provided for and the provisions at issue weren't.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.059" offset="449661">The second point I want to make is that, even putting the clear statement rule of Arbaugh to one side, statutory text, structure, purpose and history all point to classifying 411(a) as mandatory but not jurisdictional.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="98.443" stopTime="111.685">
            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="98.443" offset="499190">I think you are right that Arbaugh at least set forth a clear statement rule, but I think that's significant only going forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.407" offset="527088">I don't know that Congress, when it passed this provision, could have been aware of the clear statement rule that Arbaugh articulated.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_s_sims" startTime="111.685" stopTime="135.177">
            <label>Mr. Charles S. Sims</label>
            <text syncTime="111.685" offset="552166">Well, the Court did apply -- reiterate and apply the Arbaugh rule in the Rockwell case with respect to a provision that had predated Arbaugh, and nothing in Arbaugh said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.903" offset="593021">But in any event, our second point is that if you look at the traditional indicia of not only text but also structure, history and purpose, this provision should be ranked as mandatory but not jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.898" offset="640982">And the third point I want to get to--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="135.177" stopTime="177.500">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="135.177" offset="646102">Do you agree with the -- with the government that it's mandatory for the district court but prohibited to the court of appeals?</text>
            <text syncTime="148.391" offset="698974">The government has this hybrid where, because of the public purposes served by registration, not only can but the district court should raise the failure to register on its own, but then the government says once you have a final judgment in district court, it's no longer open for the court of appeals to raise it on its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.191" offset="790194">Do you agree with that or do you say it's for the defendants to raise, and if they don't raise it, too bad?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_s_sims" startTime="177.500" stopTime="289.530">
            <label>Mr. Charles S. Sims</label>
            <text syncTime="177.500" offset="815376">--Justice Ginsburg, we certainly agree with the government with respect to the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.576" offset="839722">With respect to the district court, on the one hand, my clients don't -- are satisfied with the government's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.851" offset="872845">On the other hand, as Justice Scalia's decision, I think, in Day v. McDonough pointed out, the traditional default rule really is that defenses are up to defendants to raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.348" offset="918821">In this particular kind of situation where there is no reason at all, I think, to suspect that defense counsel will not raise 411 whenever -- none of the cases that Ms. Merritt raises for example, involve situations of waiver, where the issues weren't raised until the court of appeals -- I think that the Court can rely, frankly, on defendants and on the ability of district judges to nudge defense counsel when they need nudging.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.865" offset="1028848">But if the Court felt that the provision was important enough so that it wanted to impose on district courts the obligation of strict policing, I think it could.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.098" offset="1069808">But as I say, I have been practicing copyright law for 25 years; I've never seen a defendant who either missed a defense or chose not to raise it.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.845" offset="1104812">The third point I want to raise if there is time is simply that, even if 411(a) were deemed jurisdictional at the outset of the case with respect to its language which talks about instituting, nothing in either its text or purpose suggests that Congress meant to deprive district courts of their usual power to settle cases with respect to approving settlement agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.834" offset="1184747">In this case, because the plaintiffs complied with 411(a) at the front door by alleging properly that they had complied with the obligation, we think the district court had jurisdiction to send the parties to mediation and then necessarily to approve the agreement they returned with three years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.280" offset="1254546">Now with respect to--</text>

          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="289.530" stopTime="340.532">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="289.530" offset="1263532">Can -- can I ask you, one of the points made by the amicus is that, if I recall it correctly, that what -- what Congress had in mind in phrasing it this way was to enable -- enable the party who had not gone to the Copyright Office to go after dismissal on jurisdictional grounds, and the implication is that if it were not held to be jurisdictional, there would be a merits dismissal because of the failure to have gone to the Copyright Office first.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.505" offset="1447434">And therefore would not -- the plaintiff would not be able to come back to the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="360.290" offset="1546595">I -- I thought she said the whole purpose of Congress was to make sure that you'd be able to come back, that your failure to go to the Copyright Office initially would not result in a merits dismissal so that you could not later go back and then rebring the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.595" offset="1619843">If it was jurisdictional, just a jurisdictional dismissal, the jurisdiction could be cured by going to the Copyright Office and your suit could then proceed.</text>

            <text syncTime="660.960" offset="2749273">And I think Washingtonian is particularly interesting because there the district court had originally held that it was jurisdictional and then sua sponte recanted a few days later and issued another position.</text>

            <text syncTime="1092.191" offset="4474190">Statutory prerequisites to suit like Section 411(a) often fall into one of two distinct categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.423" offset="4499163">They are either jurisdictional and therefore unwaivable or they are not jurisdictional and are fully waivable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.452" offset="4523196">Section 411(a)'s registration requirement falls in the middle of those two extremes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.123" offset="4541900">It is not jurisdictional, but it should not be fully waivable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.091" offset="4553812">The provision does not speak to the power of the courts to decide cases and therefore it does not limit the court's jurisdiction to adjudicate infringement suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.885" offset="4584950">But, because of this phrase and mandatory language, the requirement should be strictly enforced whenever the defendant asserts it, and because the requirement serves important public interest that are independent of the concerns of the parties to any individual suit--</text>

            <text syncTime="1137.297" offset="4654644">--I think that, in the ordinary case, the district court should -- when -- when the defendant waives the requirement, which would be the rare case, when the defendant doesn't assert it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.389" offset="4686932">When the defendant waives the requirement, the district court should consider whether accepting that waiver would undermine the public interest behind 411.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.700" offset="4716189">Now, in this particular case, it may not have been an abuse of discretion for the district court to consider those interests and decide that here it would have been acceptable to accept the defendant's waiver and permit the resolution to go forward because, in this case, the periodicals that -- that are involved -- the works at issue were primarily already in the possession of the Library of Congress, because they had been registered as -- the periodicals themselves had been registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.705" offset="4812215">So the Library's interest is not as strongly implicated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.939" offset="4821201">In addition, this is a case in which there was going to be settlement, so the Court wasn't going to need to adjudicate the copyright claims and therefore the opportunity for the register's views to be taken into account was less important.</text>

            <text syncTime="1196.870" offset="4892881">So I think in this case it may have been appropriate for the district court to conclude that -- that it could let someone go forward, notwithstanding the fact that some unregistered copyrights were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.254" offset="4942409">But after adjudication on the merits, the defendant has waived the requirement, and, having come up, Section 411(a), like any other non-jurisdictional rule, should be subject to the general principle that issues that are not raised below should not be considered for the first time on appeal, absent extraordinary circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1286.097" offset="5249818">I think also the plain error rule presupposes that there are some errors that the district court has a responsibility to correct on its own, even though neither party has brought the error to its attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.201" offset="5290256">So in other words, the district court has the obligation to issue a legal ruling that neither party has asked for, and I think that kind of regime is appropriate here because the public interest at issue, the Library's interest and the interest in the public record of copyright, those don't depend on the defendant's litigation decisions -- they shouldn't depend on the defendant's particular strategic decisions within a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.319" offset="5386700">The Library's interest will always be in having every work registered and the public interest and public record will be the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="1335.122" offset="5445945">I think it is fairly within the question of whether the rule is jurisdictional or not, I think, is -- also encompasses the question of how the rule should be enforced, assuming that it is non-jurisdictional, of what should happen in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.229" offset="5506341">So I do think that the -- the characterization of this rule as a mandatory or a waivable rule is -- is within the question presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.538" offset="5543539">So I think that the regime we're proposing best gives effect to the mandatory, but non-jurisdictional language that Congress used in Section 411(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.424" offset="5579065">And it also protects the public interest that the requirement serves, which, again, the compilation of a public record of copyrighted works in the copyright office, which allows a robust licensing system under the Copyright Act.</text>

            <label>Ms. Deborah Jones Merritt</label>
            <text syncTime="1776.169" offset="7210047">--That makes -- it's a -- it's a requirement that registration be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.462" offset="7227288">It is quite analogous, although stronger than the statute in the Hallstrom case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.853" offset="7244842">The hybrid argument that the Solicitor General was referring to is the Court's decision in the Hallstrom case, which was a provision of the environmental statutes that is common in several of those statutes providing: No action may be commenced until a notice is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.314" offset="7314641">Our provision here is stronger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.907" offset="7325090">It says: "No action shall be instituted", instead of "No action may be commenced".</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.170" offset="7350063">Even if this case is not -- even if this statute does not impose a jurisdictional limit, which I will strongly argue that it does, it at the very least imposes a mandatory command like the statute in Hallstrom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.507" offset="7403457">And there is no reason in this case to reverse the Second Circuit, even if this is a mandatory provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.551" offset="7435640">As you will recall, in Hallstrom, the parties had gone through four years of complicated environmental litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.094" offset="7461763">Went up through the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.001" offset="7469390">The court of appeals reversed, saying, you did not comply with this notice provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.028" offset="7489557">This Court held that it did not need to decide whether that provision was jurisdictional in the strictest sense of the term, because it was at least mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.104" offset="7529785">And the Court reversed despite that time, sent the case back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.789" offset="7544623">In fact, I believe, Mr. Chief Justice, you asked about whether the mandatory issue would be within the Court's grant of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.959" offset="7573253">The grant of certiorari in Hallstrom referred to the jurisdictional issue and the Court decided that rather than get to the strict issue of jurisdiction, it would decide on a mandatory forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.717" offset="7620274">But there is no reason, if we are -- if the Court wants to avoid the jurisdictional issue and to endorse the mandatory hybrid one, the Second Circuit should still be affirmed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.638" offset="7659980">The parties raised Section 411(a) quite clearly to the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.604" offset="7683803">They used this provision as their major defense of both the substance of the settlement's fairness and the representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.524" offset="7715568">The representation was the major issue that the objectors raised in the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.347" offset="7734794">And so both parties, the Plaintiffs and the defendants, argued in their briefs -- and it's simply not a few sentences; we've provided the parts of the record in the appendix to our brief -- that the reason that this settlement should be upheld was because of this mandatory, they called it then, jurisdictional provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.434" offset="7815147">That was an essential argument that they made to the district court and that they then repeated to the Second Circuit in the merits briefs long before the circuit said, then: Wait a minute; you are making a curious argument here that this is a jurisdictional provision that upholds your settlement, but that we still have the ability to look at this settlement if it's jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.173" offset="7902083">I would like to return to the language of Section 411(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.330" offset="7918696">As I have argued, it begins with this mandatory language, "No action shall be maintained".</text>

            <text syncTime="1973.635" offset="7999990">And those are not considered jurisdictional.</text>

            <text syncTime="1977.523" offset="8015559">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.537" offset="8019529">That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.913" offset="8025067">Many of those statutes refer specifically to exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.006" offset="8037397">The Prison Litigation Reform Act, for example, that some of the parties cite, refers specifically to exhaustion of remedies after the "no action" sort of language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.733" offset="8080342">Every jurisdictional statute has its own language and its own story.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.216" offset="8102285">We could say they are like Tolstoy's unhappy families; they are all different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.666" offset="8120048">And in this case, the story of the Copyright Act and its language is very distinctive, both in the public purposes that it furthers and in the language that it uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.066" offset="8161635">Again, on the statutory language, we have the very mandatory language, "no action shall be instituted".</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.094" offset="8185772">No modifiers; there's no provision for waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.529" offset="8199565">The Solicitor General's assistant mentioned that this statute is like fee waivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.527" offset="8223493">It's not at all like a fee waiver, because the statute for fee waivers explicitly gives the district judge authority to waive the fee in the case of an in forma pauperis plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.116" offset="8269887">This statute contains no waiver for the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.193" offset="8282216">It contains no discretion for the district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.317" offset="8294651">And in the last word of -- the last sentence of this very short three-sentence provision, Congress referred explicitly to jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.609" offset="8335820">And I would like to look very closely at that word, because any plain reading of this section will show -- shows that Congress intended the entire provision to refer to the jurisdiction of the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2070.542" offset="8387542">I thought that -- that last sentence is just relating to the court can -- has authority to decide this particular issue, copyrightability, even though the registrant has chosen not to enter the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.421" offset="8479075">The sentence simply says, court, you have authority to decide this question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2098.697" offset="8500182">That's the most immediate reference, Justice Ginsburg, but the three sentences work together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.245" offset="8526409">And if we look at the three sentences, they appear on the first page of the Petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.130" offset="8545949">The first sentence creates two categories of cases: Those that the Court may decide and those it may not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.176" offset="8574161">Let us say for now we are not meaning what that power is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.254" offset="8586386">We are simply saying two categories of cases, one the court may decide, the other one it may not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.063" offset="8609688">The second sentence then adds a small group of cases to this first category, the one that the court may decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.870" offset="8640930">As opposing counsel mentioned, Congress did that in response to a particular case, the Vacheron case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.554" offset="8667679">Vacheron itself was built on a line of cases holding that the previous section like 411(a) was a jurisdictional limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.752" offset="8704460">The reason that courts could not consider a copy -- an application for -- a petition for infringement complaint, I'm sorry, from a person who had not yet gotten registration was because they construed that predecessor as jurisdictional and therefore, they had no jurisdiction to hear an infringement claim until this person instituted a mandamus suit and got the certificate from the registrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2172.479" offset="8795366">I would have thought that cut against you in the sense that the same paragraph Congress used the word "jurisdiction", but they didn't use that in the provision that you are arguing, does deprive the court of jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2186.740" offset="8852417">No, Mr. Chief Justice, because when Congress revised this statute in 1976, it had before it 60 years already of courts construing its language, no action shall be maintained, which was the previous 1909 language as a jurisdictional limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.387" offset="8926919">There had not been any resistance to that notion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.076" offset="8941756">Even courts as early as the 1920s in the Lumiere case, the Second Circuit did not hold there was "jurisdiction", but it held that this provision was unwaiverable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.789" offset="8980626">What the parties want to do here, of course, is to waive the provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.724" offset="8996300">So the language was working quite nicely for Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.536" offset="9007585">No action shall be maintained, they switched it to instituted to make clear that they meant at the beginning of the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.313" offset="9034648">There had been a few parties who had argued during the early 20th century that if they snuck in the door, they could remain inside -- or I'm sorry, once they got inside, they could file the -- certificate, and the courts rejected that, but Congress cleared up that particular problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.043" offset="9097550">So Congress knows that its first sentence is working quite well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.947" offset="9113224">Congress then adds this second sentence to -- these, of course, are people working with the Copyright Office, experts in the area of copyright law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.632" offset="9147914">Congress adds the second sentence which adds the small category of cases to the ones that may come before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.628" offset="9179888">And then in the final sentence, Congress gives a clarification about that final group of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.235" offset="9206324">As Justice Ginsburg said, the -- Congress made clear that when the registrar decides not to appear in these cases, the Court may still go on and has the power to decide these cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2317.841" offset="9376747">Before 1909, owners of copyright had to dot every "I" and cross every "T" within a limited period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.133" offset="9406004">If they didn't, they lost their entire ownership in the copyright.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.787" offset="9420528">What Congress wanted to do in 1909 was to give copyright owners a longer period of time to comply with some of these formalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.518" offset="9455532">But, it still wanted to preserve the public interest that registration serves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.876" offset="9476953">We haven't talked yet about the major public interest that Congress had in mind here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.314" offset="9494716">It is ironically the very problem that gave rise to this lawsuit, trying to find the owner's of copyrighted works.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.841" offset="9520734">Before using a copyrighted work, any person needs to find the owner to ask permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.618" offset="9547901">The electronic databases in this case have argued that they are somehow special, that because they need to obtain many permissions, they shouldn't have to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.239" offset="9586354">Universities, libraries, archives obtain as many or more permissions as electronic databases in every year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.516" offset="9623448">For large universities like Harvard University or the Ohio State University, we have to obtain permissions for every article that is distributed in course packs to our students.</text>

            <text syncTime="3576.609" offset="14411901">They got the rights by contract from the publishers, with representations and warranties, and that's why, when this case was instituted, they went to mediation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3588.557" offset="14459653">They got money from the publishers, who were exposed under representations and warranties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.069" offset="14477730">The authors were represented by the three major national freelance author groups in the country, and this was a way, we thought, to address this problem responsibly and without taking the Court's time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.455" offset="14527258">Now, Mr. Chief Justice Roberts, you said a couple of times that you wonder whether the language here, v. Bock, which, I think -- if I am remembering, you authored, but, in any event, it was within a year or two, said that was boilerplate language used all the time for statutes of limitations that are not jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.054" offset="14609596">And, indeed, that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.821" offset="14616701">In the footnote of our reply brief, we list three times in the 19th century when that very language was used for statutes of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.693" offset="14652228">And, if you put it into LEXIS or Westlaw, you will get a zillion statutes with respect to -- exhaust nonjurisdictional statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.722" offset="14684306">So I think, quite to the contrary, that -- that is the language Congress uses when it wants something to be not jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.625" offset="14707921">Now, Ms. Merritt began with the word 411(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.293" offset="14726625">I want to be clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.964" offset="14729237">This case was instituted in compliance with 411(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.618" offset="14743865">The named plaintiffs registered their works and came into court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.557" offset="14755673">It went to mediation, and the next thing the court knew, it had a settlement agreement to review, and it did review under Rule 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.427" offset="14787124">She relies on the Hallstrom case, but, of course, the Hallstrom case, which did avoid saying whether it was mandatory or jurisdictional, involved the enforcement of a mandatory -- at least mandatory rule, on the application of a party, and that's what the Court does, and that's why, to some extent, other than with respect to settlement agreements, this case doesn't matter a lot because the defendants will always be raising this defense.</text>
