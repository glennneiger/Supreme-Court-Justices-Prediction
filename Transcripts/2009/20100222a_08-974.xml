            <text syncTime="25.881" offset="209941">The only question presented is whether each use of the cutoff score in each of the hiring rounds was a separate violation of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.756" offset="249438">An affirmative answer to that question is both the best reading of the statute and the soundest policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="104.233" offset="523410">Our position is that in fact there was an additional violation when the classification occurred when the City announced what it intended to do in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.773" offset="565520">That's also a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.125" offset="570953">But if I can make the contrast, Mr. Chief Justice, when the City -- suppose they didn't announce anything at all, and what they did was in all those occasions, the 11 I just described -- they used the unlawful cutoff score and made hiring decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.920" offset="638140">Title VII's disparate impact looks at the consequences of decisions like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.657" offset="665098">And those consequences, the results of that clearly occur in the future on those 11 hiring occasions, and then we would clearly have a cause of action on each of those 11 times.</text>

            <text syncTime="158.218" offset="739286">That announcement is an independent violation, but that announcement does not change the impact and the consequences that in fact still would happen in the future when they happen.</text>

            <text syncTime="224.762" offset="1005526">So I think there is an impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.162" offset="1011064">It's not the same impact that ripples through time.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.314" offset="1023707">And the reason I said, if they had not made an announcement it's clear there are consequences that happen in the future each of those 11 times, there's an additional violation when they actually use the announcement to say what they intend to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.574" offset="1076788">They say what they intend to do, and then they do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="278.231" offset="1219417">It's our position that, in fact, all three of the sections I quoted from are implicated in the actions that Chicago took.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.587" offset="1256824">Clearly, there's a classification, but when they actually exclude from actual consideration for any of the jobs on the 11 occasions, that's a limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.293" offset="1295590">It's clearly a limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.311" offset="1303740">When they use the test results, that's an action upon the test results.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.299" offset="1323593">When they use that to make decisions, that's clearly a violation of (k).</text>

            <text syncTime="319.058" offset="1382630">And the way disparate impact law works is, you have an employment practice -- it's always facially neutral -- that has an adverse impact on the basis of race that causes there to be a disparate impact and consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.782" offset="1429546">We look at consequences, and the elements of the disparate impact violation are not complete until we have all of those elements.</text>

            <text syncTime="346.625" offset="1492971">And I wonder if you could explain why that is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.077" offset="1506764">Here, the City of Chicago continued to use this test for quite a number of years after it was administered.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.747" offset="1533409">And so as you interpret the statute, I gather that someone could still file a disparate impact claim 6 or 7 years after the test was first administered, and quite a few years after it was first used in making a hiring decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.359" offset="1603835">And how can that be squared with Congress's evident desire in Title VII to require that an EEOC charge be filed rather promptly after the employment action is taken?</text>

            <label>Mr. John A. Payton</label>
            <text syncTime="385.584" offset="1648765">I think the answer is that this is completely consistent with how the statute works, but I'm going to address the policy concern as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.272" offset="1687531">But how the statute works is, there's a violation every time there's a use.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.926" offset="1706130">If we looked at disparate treatment, there's a violation every time there's an intention to discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.962" offset="1726297">If there was a future intention to discriminate, there would be a new violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.616" offset="1740925">So if there is a next use, there's a next violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.834" offset="1757748">And that's how that ought to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.020" offset="1766525">But look at how this worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.472" offset="1776347">Chicago used an unlawful cutoff score on those 11 occasions to make decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.257" offset="1795469">Chicago should have stopped using the discriminatory cutoff score, and it should have looked at all of the qualified applicants that it had judged qualified in making its decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="454.645" offset="1925036">And I think this Court has always made it clear the standard may be in Ricci, but the law is clearly that if Chicago has reason to believe -- very good reason to believe that it is doing something that is unlawful, it can stop doing something unlawful.</text>

            <text syncTime="489.484" offset="2064426">Chicago used a cutoff score that the district court finds and that their expert who designed the test told them was problematic, to make decisions that has nothing job-related about it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.994" offset="2126388">It's arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.944" offset="2130254">The group that are qualified are as qualified as the group that are well qualified and vice versa.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.064" offset="2150734">They had available to them the option of picking randomly from that group, both groups combined, and making the decisions on a random draw.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.670" offset="2193157">That is, in fact, how they made all of the decisions inside of the groups that they used.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.824" offset="2209771">That's always available.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.674" offset="2213115">Chicago could have done that at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.857" offset="2221892">The policy point here, Justice Alito, is that -- I'd say the animating purpose behind Title VII is, as this Court has said, the eradication of discrimination from our workplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.434" offset="2272152">And you want it to be eradicated.</text>

            <text syncTime="605.790" offset="2529614">The first answer is that the statute of limitations is 300 days after every use, and it's no longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.860" offset="2557931">So for whatever it is, if you violate Title VII, the statute of limitations is 300 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.229" offset="2575381">If there is a use that goes into the future, it's 300 days after the last use.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.383" offset="2591995">Right now, Chicago has stopped using that.</text>

            <text syncTime="626.035" offset="2610594">To your specific question about how would it work if there was a layoff arrangement, the proposed -- the remedy order in this case -- it's not in effect because we are where we are -- but the remedy order in this case includes shutting down the use of this, but it also has provisions for seniority to in fact address, I believe, exactly the circumstances you just described, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.335" offset="2715815">So I believe that is contemplated and handled in the remedial order.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.739" offset="2733369">The issue about the policy here, though, is that if you don't say that a use, in fact, can be challenged, a use of something unlawful can be challenged, what you could end up with here is that Chicago would then take the message that it's okay once they are past the first 300 days, and they could just go on using the discriminatory cutoff score over and over and over again, and that is inconsistent with the overall policy of what Title VII is trying to root out of our economy and in our workplace.</text>

            <text syncTime="942.338" offset="3875756">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As the questions I think reveal, I think the bottom line question in this case is whether or not under the text of Title VII there was a present violation in each of the 11 rounds of hiring when the City of Chicago relied on its concededly discriminatory test to exclude the plaintiffs from consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.799" offset="3957676">And we think that Title VII has three mutually reinforcing provisions in it, each of which point to the same conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.738" offset="3985366">A violation of Title VII occurred in this case when Chicago, in each of those 11 rounds, used its hiring practice with -- and caused a disparate impact, thereby limiting the employment opportunities of certain applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.979" offset="4038343">Chicago gave an ability test and relied on that ability test in a way that Title VII forbids.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.950" offset="4066241">It took action upon the results of that discriminatory test in a way that arbitrarily excluded qualified applicants from being hired.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.590" offset="4104798">Justice Alito, I think -- in response to your question, I think our position follows entirely from the text of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.744" offset="4137399">We're not as concerned about the policy consequences, though we do think that if the Court were concerned about the policy consequences, we think that there's a good reason why Congress distinguished between disparate treatment and disparate impact litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.956" offset="4198316">But it's the language of Title VII itself, and in particular 703(h), which forbids action upon the results.</text>

            <text syncTime="1031.293" offset="4231649">Why would Congress have wanted to allow a question like this to be left open for such an extended period of time?</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.798" offset="4257667">Why would it not have wanted everybody who is potentially affected by it to understand where things stand at a much earlier point, at some reasonable period of time after all of the information is in the -- in the possession of a potential plaintiff to determine whether there has been a disparate impact and whether that -- that person is going to be adversely affected by it, particularly if at a later point the effect of a remedial decree can be to upset the employment -- the employment status of other people who have been hired in the interim?</text>

            <text syncTime="1076.007" offset="4410431">I agree that there -- there might be policy arguments against it as well as for it, but here's the way I think we look at it -- and the United States is the nation's largest employer, and we face similar concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.713" offset="4453272">We give certain tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.729" offset="4457347">But I think what might have been -- what was probably animating Congress was a fear that if the rule of the City of Chicago were adopted, then an employer who made it 300 days without an EEOC charge being filed, 300 days after the announcement of the test results, would then be able to for all time use that discriminatory test, and it would lock in that period, that test, for as long as 10, 20 years, and Congress could have legitimately worried about if a test made it 300 days, an employer essentially had a get-out-of-jail -- free card to use for all time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.654" offset="4601020">And I would say that that precise thing appears to have happened in this very case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.356" offset="4619828">At Joint Appendix page 54, when the City announced its test results in January of 1996, it said it intended to use this test for only 3 years through 1999.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.098" offset="4662878">Afterwards, 1999 came, the City, in the City's own briefs -- this is the court of appeals brief at page 12 -- they admit they made a new decision to continue using this test and the test results for subsequent hiring rounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.506" offset="4720452">That was a new decision, and indeed that's a decision, I think, many employers would logically make after 3 years, because then they don't have to worry about the possibility of a disparate impact lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.296" offset="4763606">And since, as this Court said in Ricci, one of the goals of Title VII is really to encourage voluntary compliance on the part of employers, adopting a rule like the City of Chicago's is really antithetical to that, because then it will essentially lock in for all time that old discriminatory test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.275" offset="4835495">I think another reason policy -- another policy reason Congress may have thought about is that a rule that forced people to file within 300 days might be damaging to the EEOC and divisive to employers, because it would say you only have that 300-day period to file, even before all the consequences of the -- of the -- of the employment decision are fully understood.</text>

            <text syncTime="1367.343" offset="5575805">Now, this Court has said in cases such as Ledbetter that -- that there must be a present violation, and disparate impact litigation looks quite different than disparate treatment litigation in practice, because disparate impact litigation doesn't need that missing element that has been at issue in Ledbetter and Evans and Ricks, of discriminatory intent at that subsequent time of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.478" offset="5676325">Here, in a disparate impact case, all that need be shown by the plaintiff is adverse impact, and that adverse impact happens in each of those 11 rounds of hiring.</text>

            <text syncTime="1442.844" offset="5877781">Let me say two things: First is I think (h)(2) refers to 10 years is itself action upon the results, and so I think as a statutory matter the language decides it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.384" offset="5923965">Now, with respect to the policy reason, I think the reason is that otherwise Congress had to fear precisely what you're saying, that an employer 10 years from now would use that discriminatory test, because they knew they had made it past the 300-day initial phase of time, and then could use it for all time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.613" offset="6000870">And so the statute of limitations and the concerns about repose work hand in hand with other concerns of Title VII, and in particular incentivizing employers to ensure voluntary compliance with the law of Title VII, and which this Court said in Griggs, the goal of which is to eradicate discrimination from the United States' labor markets.</text>

            <text syncTime="1552.382" offset="6316011">Petitioners were told that a priority pool had been created, that based on their scores they were not classified in that pool, and that further consideration of candidates would be limited to those who were in the priority pool, at least until everyone in that pool had been called for processing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.628" offset="6392916">The City also publicly admitted that this tiered eligibility list had adverse impact on African-Americans, and Petitioners were aware of this.</text>

            <text syncTime="1592.292" offset="6475567">Now they contend that charges can be filed to challenge the same exam and the same cutoff score every time the City hired from the priority hiring pool.</text>

            <label>Mr. John A. Payton</label>
            <text syncTime="3347.755" offset="13497490">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.922" offset="13502088">This is a case about jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.374" offset="13511910">And I want to read from the letter that Justice Alito was referring to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.444" offset="13532181">This is the letter that the qualifieds received.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.229" offset="13547332">It's in our Joint Appendix at JA-35, and it's the last sentence of the first paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.816" offset="13573663">This is the letter that they all got.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.935" offset="13582232">This is the letter that Arthur Lewis, the named person in the case, got.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.989" offset="13598427">However, it says: You are qualified; you are qualified; there are well-qualifieds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.624" offset="13616922">And it's unlikely -- that language is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.726" offset="13625386">And then it says:</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.376" offset="13627998">"However, because it is not possible at this time to predict how many applicants will be hired in the next few years, your name will be kept on the eligible list maintained by the department of personnel for as long as that list is used. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.069" offset="13682751">I did focus on the word "used".</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.204" offset="13699260">And it's not only in section (k).</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.056" offset="13706679">It's also in section (h), where it says, "used to discriminate".</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.358" offset="13723920">Because it's an ordinary word that the City used itself in advising the Petitioners in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.095" offset="13754849">In the answer to the complaint in this case, which is at Joint Appendix 19, the -- I'm sorry, Joint Appendix 16, the answer to -- actually, the first paragraph in the complaint in this case, the City says as follows -- this is the second sentence in the answer to the complaint: "Defendant" -- the City --</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.579" offset="13856726">"admits that it has used and continues to use results of the 1995 firefighter entrance examination as part of its firefighter hiring process. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.803" offset="13901657">Using an unlawful cutoff score -- and the eligibility list is nothing other than the functional equivalent of the cutoff score -- using that to make decisions on those 11 times is a violation of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.980" offset="13962365">And the argument that there is no additional impact -- it is the dramatic difference between being told what someone intends to do and then they do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.835" offset="14005833">You are told that maybe your chances are going to be minimal in the future, or maybe 50/50, but then when it actually starts happening and you see other people start getting jobs, that's an impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.476" offset="14052331">That's a consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.345" offset="14055779">When I said the animating principle in Title VII and disparate impact is result and consequences, it's results and consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.099" offset="14086813">Those are additional impacts that go with the additional uses that clearly establish a violation of Title VII's disparate impact prohibition in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.307" offset="14127668">I don't think that the statutory language is actually -- I think the best reading, as I said, of the statutory language is as I said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.877" offset="14157970">I think the policies behind how that works -- it is 300 days after every use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.316" offset="14187750">There is a statute, but, in fact, the control over that is entirely within the City.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.018" offset="14206558">If they stopped using this unlawful cutoff score after 300 days, they are completely done with any potential liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.041" offset="14234561">And the point is you want that to be challenged, because we don't want unlawful employment practices to continue to go forever and ever and ever and ever out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.913" offset="14278134">And we can see, in this very case, that if you don't allow the challenge, the practice goes on and is inconsistent with the -- I'd say the national policy to rid our workplace of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.322" offset="14327766">Are there any other questions otherwise?</text>
