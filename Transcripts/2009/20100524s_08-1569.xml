            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">Justice Kennedy has our opinion this morning in case 08-1569, United States versus O'Brien.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="7.523" offset="135461">In this case, United States versus O'Brien et al, the respondents attempted to rob an armored car at gunpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.755" offset="172450">They fled, but were later captured and charged with various federal offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.348" offset="194811">One of the counts in the indictment charged them with use of firearms during a crime of violence and a second -- a separate count charged them with using a machine gun during their crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.549" offset="243608">Now use of a firearm during a crime of violence carries a five-year mandatory minimum sentence, but if a firearm is a machine gun, the mandatory minimum sentence is 30 years imprisonment and the dispute here is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.409" offset="307033">Does the machine gun provision of the controlling statute state an element of an offense to be established at the guilt phase of the trial or is it a sentencing factor that need only be found by the trial judge in the sentencing phase?</text>
            <text syncTime="64.806" offset="364607">The Trial Court and the Court of Appeals both ruled that whether a machine gun was involved is an element of the offense to be proved at the guilt phase of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.460" offset="407239">The government disputes this conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.956" offset="417270">The government contends that the machine gun question is a sentencing factor, so that the relevant facts are for the judge to determine a sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.096" offset="453841">The controlling statute is 18 U.S.C., Section 924 (c)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="93.118" offset="477874">We've interpreted the statute before.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.727" offset="488323">Indeed one of those cases Castillo versus United States was on this very point, but the statute as it was interpreted -- as Castillo was later amended, so we found it necessary to revisit the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.513" offset="543493">Castillo was decided 10 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.974" offset="553315">The Court then held in a unanimous opinion that the machine gun provision in an earlier version of the statute was an element of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.655" offset="588006">We reached that same conclusion here and we agree with the Trial Court and the Court of Appeals in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.331" offset="614755">Since the statute has to be considered in each of its parts, it's appropriate to make this discussion and summary even more brief than usual.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.327" offset="670762">When evaluating the statutory provision as it existed in Castillo, the Court looked to five factors in determining whether a particular fact is either an element or a sentencing factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.783" offset="716528">First, the language and structure of the statute; second, whether the facts were historically treated as elements or sentencing factors; third, the comparative risk of unfairness accompanying each interpret -- either interpretation; fourth, the severity of the additional sentence; and fifth, the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.660" offset="792074">Today's opinion discusses these factors and we conclude as we did in Castillo that the machine gun provision is an element of an offense rather than a sentencing factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.440" offset="831154">Little of import has change since Castillo.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.166" offset="842125">The second through fifth factors continue to point in the same direction they did ten years ago and given the Court's conclusion in Castillo that the machine gun provision was an offense element; a substitutive change in the statute should not be inferred absent a clear indication from Congress of a change in policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.429" offset="911088">Nothing in the congressional amendment to Section 924 suggests that change.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.260" offset="930419">The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.278" offset="946510">Justice Stevens has filed a concurring opinion; Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
