            <label>Mr. Robert F. Friedman</label>

            <text syncTime="3386.901" offset="13651968">I'm hearing terms like "safe thing to do".</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.722" offset="13671299">And in response to -- I think it was a question from Justice Scalia, I'm hearing my colleague state that there is concern that the arbitrator is not going to apply State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.494" offset="13706407">This is merely distrust of arbitrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.212" offset="13721245">This Court has rejected this bias that arbitrators cannot make these decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.080" offset="13740680">And, in fact, this Court and many others have sent very, very complicated issues to the arbitrator to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.632" offset="13762936">There is no reason to believe that an arbitrator, as well as a judge, cannot decide State law issues of unconscionability, and the arbitrator will have the discretion and the ability to either strike the entire arbitration agreement or strike certain clauses as he or she sees fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.510" offset="13830437">Furthermore, this type of speculation, this fear as to what the arbitrator may do, that was rejected in this Court's decisions in Vimar and PacifiCare, where the Court stated we are going to enforce this, and the arbitrator may do something wrong, may do something right, but at the tail end there will be an ability under section 10 to address it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.590" offset="13910789">There is no difference there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.157" offset="13917059">Additionally, this -- this analysis of unconscionability -- I want to reiterate unconscionability is based on a policy decision that -- that attacks an agreement that unquestionably has already been made.</text>

            <text syncTime="3465.167" offset="13965019">What is the one-sentence answer, one sentence, to the thing, this is a very interesting case, lots of stuff in it that we needn't reach because irrespective of everything else, they in their reply, the district court, and the court of appeals all said these whole four pages, the whole four pages were unconscionable, so none of it's enforceable, and all we have to decide is whether that's an issue for the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3553.206" offset="14317255">If it's discovery, that doesn't go to depriving them of anything because the arbitrator could give them more discovery if he or she chose.</text>

            <text syncTime="3576.285" offset="14409519">So it does not come under making; it would be under a -- a Randolph standard or under a First Options standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.689" offset="14435119">There's two areas that we agree are for the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.224" offset="14449330">One is to determine whether or not there's an issue with the making of the agreement.</text>
