            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">Justice Thomas has our opinion this morning in case 08-103 Elsevier versus Muchnick.</text>

            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="7.000" offset="133371">Now this case comes to us on the writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.085" offset="161792">In New York Times versus Tasini, we held that several print publishers and owners of online databases had infringed the copyrights of six freelance authors by reproducing the author's works, electronically, without for securing their permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.565" offset="243712">Those holding affirmed the theory of liability underlying other copyright infringement lawsuits then pending against the publishers and database owners for similar conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.825" offset="292718">Following Tasini, these other lawsuits were consolidated into a single case.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.026" offset="321557">The authors then filed an amended class-action complaint against the publishing companies and database owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.517" offset="351441">The named plaintiffs each owned at least one copyright that they had registered with the copyright office in accordance with the Copyright Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.527" offset="395536">But class also included authors who had not registered their copyright works.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.373" offset="418941">After years of negotiations, the parties reached a comprehensive settlement agreement and moved to District Court to approve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.439" offset="459170">Some of the authors of unregistered works objected, arguing that settlement treated them unfairly as compared to authors of registered works.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.681" offset="504101">The District Court overruled these objections, certified a settlement class and approve the settlement agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.382" offset="539000">The objecting authors appeal before oral argument to Court of Appeals on its own accord asked the parties to brief whether the District Court had subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate infringement claims involving unregistered copyrights.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.116" offset="613919">The basis for the courts inquiry 17 USC 4, section 411 (a) which provides an relevant part that no civil action for infringement of the copyright in any United States, in any United States work shall be instituted until pre-registration or registration of the copyright claim has been made in accordance with the Copyright Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.112" offset="725828">All parties filed briefs contending that the District Court had subject matter jurisdiction to certify a class of claims arising from the infringement of unregistered works and to approve a settlement with respect to those same claims, the Court of Appeals disagreed and vacated the order approving the settlement agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.730" offset="816316">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, section 41ll (a) is a registration requirement, is a pre-condition to filing a claim for copyright infringement, that does not restrict the federal court subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.149" offset="886011">Congress did not clearly state that section 411 (a) is registration requirement is jurisdiction and nothing about the structure of section 411 (a) or its context including this Court's prior interpretation of similar provisions, suggests that Congress nonetheless ranked the registration requirement as jurisdictional despite the absence of clear jurisdictional label.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.534" offset="987575">Accordingly the District Court had subject matter jurisdiction to certify the settlement class and to approve the settlement agreement even though it included claims arising from the alleged infringement of unregistered copyright works.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.732" offset="1056329">Justice Ginsburg has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment in which Justice Stevens and Justice Breyer joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.621" offset="1095931">Justice Sotomayor took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
