            <text syncTime="9.539" offset="143611">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Since the inception of the Rules Enabling Act, this Court has repeatedly held that within their scope of operation, rules promulgated under that Act govern the practice and procedure of Federal courts in diversity and Federal question cases alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.483" offset="215395">This case concerns whether a New York State law prohibiting New York State courts from certifying a class applies in a Federal diversity action and displaces the otherwise applicable Federal class certification standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.779" offset="284568">Whether the case is viewed as presenting a question under the Rules Enabling Act as construed in Hanna v. Plumer, or instead more generally as an Erie question, the answer is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.437" offset="335141">The State rule does not govern.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.205" offset="342246">That result is underscored by the Class Action Fairness Act, which extended Federal diversity jurisdiction to cases of this type precisely so that Federal procedural standards would apply.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="73.881" offset="400969">But this is a procedural standard that has a manifestly substantive purpose, which is to restrict recoveries of penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.308" offset="466693">In that sense, it's like a cap on damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.228" offset="486337">And if you're right, then the purpose that New York had would be completely undermined, because what lawyer would bring a $500 case in State court when she could bring a $5 million case in Federal court?</text>

            <text syncTime="115.725" offset="568362">--Well, to begin with, I -- I don't think that it's a substantive rule because it reflects a policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.231" offset="602321">The policy here, as described by the New York Court of Appeals in the Sperry case, is that the -- the legislature believed that class actions were not necessary in this category of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.389" offset="658954">I think that is ultimately a procedural policy.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="148.679" offset="700123">And how is it different from Cohen v. Beneficial, the security for costs?</text>
            <text syncTime="154.166" offset="722066">Procedural in one sense, but with a definite substantive purpose in mind; that is, to restrict derivative actions.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="scott_l_nelson" startTime="165.206" stopTime="236.654">
            <label>Mr. Scott L. Nelson</label>
            <text syncTime="165.206" offset="766265">Well, the Cohen case I think is different in this respect, although when Cohen was decided shareholder derivative actions together with class actions were under Rule 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.866" offset="824884">Those things have now been divorced, and shareholder derivative actions differ from class actions in the Rule 23 sense in a fundamental way.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.339" offset="862814">In Rule 23, the class is composed solely of individuals who each have a substantive right to pursue that recovery under the relevant law.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.612" offset="903879">In a derivative action, the plaintiff is actually asserting a substantive right to -- to really assert a claim on behalf of someone else, the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.087" offset="949750">And what the Court said in Cohen and elaborated more in the Kamen case in 1991 is that that question is really a matter of the law of shareholder-corporate relations, the circumstances in which a shareholder may bring a derivative suit, and isn't really answered by the Federal rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.583" offset="1035745">And in Cohen in particular, what the Court focused on--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="236.654" offset="1052045">You could say just as well here that the question isn't addressed by the Federal rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.308" offset="1074615">If New York wants to say this kind of claim can be brought only as an individual action, not as a class action, why shouldn't the Federal court say that's perfectly fine; this class of cases can't be brought as a class action; we respect the State's position on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.638" offset="1159983">Why should we as a Federal court in a diversity case create a claim that the -- that the State never created?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="scott_l_nelson" startTime="274.410" stopTime="346.206">
            <label>Mr. Scott L. Nelson</label>
            <text syncTime="274.410" offset="1203033">--Well, the reason is that Rule 23 actually does address the issue, and it's the same issue that the -- that the State rule tries to address, which is whether the matters may be certified as a class.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.603" offset="1259875">Not only does Rule 23(b) provide explicitly that the court may certify an action if the Rule 23(b)(1), (2), or (3) criteria are met, but this Court also emphasized in the Califano v. Yamasaki case that under Rule 1, the Federal rules apply to all actions in the Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.866" offset="1348901">And what that means, as the Court put it in Yamasaki, is that a class action is available, potentially, if the 23 standards are satisfied, in any action within the Federal courts, unless Congress has exercised its power to override a Federal rule, which, as the author of Federal law, Congress is always empowered to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.798" offset="1444613">The difference as to -- as to the State is that the State has no power to displace Federal law, and Rule 23, promulgated under the Rules Enabling Act, is Federal law.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="346.206" offset="1490275">This Court in its recent decisions has been sensitive to not overriding State limitations, and so has read the Federal rule to avoid the conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.651" offset="1560074">Gasperini is one such case with regard to Rule 59, interpreted so that you do not collide with the State policy, and the same thing with Semtek with Rule 41(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="379.577" offset="1623709">The Federal rule is interpreted so as not to conflict with the State policy.</text>

            <label>Mr. Scott L. Nelson</label>
            <text syncTime="386.850" offset="1652861">Well, I would -- I would actually first go back to what the Court said in Walker, and I don't think it's -- Walker v. Armco, and I don't think it's disavowed that that the Federal rule is given its plain meaning, and when a collision is unavoidable, the Court -- the Court recognizes conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.894" offset="1724959">Gasperini, I think, is -- is different, with due respect to someone who probably knows more about it than I do.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.583" offset="1763725">But as I read Gasperini at least, I see the Court there saying that what is going to be applied in the Federal court is what it saw as a substantive standard limiting damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.808" offset="1812626">That is to say, damages are excessive if they are in excess of -- manifestly exceed what is--</text>

            <text syncTime="433.961" offset="1841256">But there wasn't a cap on damages in Gasperini.</text>

          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="439.898" stopTime="448.721">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="439.898" offset="1864976">--It was that we want the courts to exercise a role in checking these damages so they won't be excessive.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="scott_l_nelson" startTime="448.721" stopTime="510.878">
            <label>Mr. Scott L. Nelson</label>
            <text syncTime="448.721" offset="1900293">Well, the -- the Court in Gasperini said what it saw was a substantive principle of New York law, was that damages could not exceed reasonable compensation for the -- for the plaintiff's injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.629" offset="1951911">Now, that -- that is not a cap in the sense of $1 million, $5 million, $50,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.135" offset="1977929">But it's a cap in the sense of providing the substantive standard by which the court determines excessiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.704" offset="2004261">And as for Rule 59, the reason the Court saw no conflict there is Rule 59 simply provides the procedural mechanism within which a defendant makes a motion to seek a new trial on the grounds of excessiveness of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.500" offset="2075418">But it -- but excessiveness of damages is, to go back to a point that was made in the previous argument, like fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.106" offset="2109795">Fairness in relation to what?</text>
            <text syncTime="503.039" offset="2117528">Excessiveness of damages has to be judged according to what the State law is on what damages one is entitled to recover.</text>

            <text syncTime="541.831" offset="2272695">Now, as to the State statutes, I think the State statutes are very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.568" offset="2295683">Some of them may or may not be valid, but they operate very differently from the State statute at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.406" offset="2323059">They focus on particular rights of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.275" offset="2334553">Some of them set forth limits on recovery that really are set forth as damages caps, and all of them are tied specifically to the substantive cause of action created by State law.</text>

            <text syncTime="572.868" offset="2396933">So suppose in this case the New York legislature, instead of having a statute that covered penalties generally, minimum recoveries generally, wrote into each statute, each penalty statute, each minimal recovery statute, that this suit must -- may not be brought as a class action -- instead of having an encompassing statute that covered all of them, wrote into each individual statute that limitation.</text>

            <text syncTime="604.803" offset="2524620">I'm not -- I'm still not certain that I -- that I think that the State court can do that, because I don't think that a limitation on whether an action can be brought as a class establishes substantive rights within the meaning of the Rules Enabling Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2652.897" offset="10717038">Here, in New York, we actually know that's true because the Sperry court says that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2672.394" offset="10794987">But it says,</text>

            <text syncTime="2959.179" offset="11942181">And so there is nothing in the Class Action Fairness Act that changes the scope of Rule 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.849" offset="11972796">Again, Rule 23 just doesn't address this antecedent issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.867" offset="11988888">It assumes, but does not require, that you have a cause of action that is amenable to class certification in the first place.</text>

            <text syncTime="3006.826" offset="12132770">The other side -- Shady Grove would walk you right into an extremely problematic situation from the point of view of the Rules Enabling Act, as well as creating these -- these incentives that really go against the heart of the Erie doctrine that would turn a $500 case into a $5 million case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.239" offset="12218347">And one interesting point, I think, is that all these statutes that are listed in our Appendix B that limit class certification for particular causes of action -- under their theory that Rule 23 requires that everything be amenable to class certification, those would all be out the window.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.368" offset="12290863">I don't think counsel really wanted to admit that this morning, but the logic of their theory that -- is that Rule 23 governs this case and Rule 23 requires that every cause of action that comes before it be eligible for class certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.210" offset="12350213">That would knock out each and every one of the statutes in Appendix B.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.246" offset="12362439">They don't live up to -- in their reply brief, at footnote 10, on page 15, they try to distinguish those statutes by saying, ah, well, the limitation on class actions in those statutes is in the substantive cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.856" offset="12424819">It's not in -- it's not somewhere else in the code, but that doesn't -- that doesn't save their argument under Rule 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.278" offset="12454494">They really can't square that with their -- their core position that Rule 23 itself answers the question presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.983" offset="12493364">And, again, what we would ask the Court is just to -- is to recognize that Rule 23 occupies the ground it occupies, but it doesn't go -- it occupies the ground of the criteria, which go to the efficiency and fairness of the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.493" offset="12547385">But where a State has made an antecedent decision that -- that a particular cause of action or a particular remedy is categorically unavailable -- or ineligible for class certification, that's a decision that Federal courts should respect under the Erie doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="3137.960" offset="12657309">I would like to begin with the point that my friend made about the 901(b) and that that somehow indicated that it applied only to New York State statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.702" offset="12700254">In fact, the New York courts have applied that "unless" clause to Federal statutes, holding in one case that the Truth in Lending Act satisfied the "unless" clause because it authorized a class action, and in another that the Telephone Consumer Protection Act did not because it didn't authorize a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.080" offset="12773710">So it actually is, I think, quite clear from the language of the statute and from the Court's application--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="3174.317" offset="12802654">There -- when you are dealing with a Federal statute, there's a -- there's a factor that doesn't come up when you are dealing with sister States, and that is the Supremacy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.125" offset="12841942">If Congress has made a judgment -- let's say 1983 -- I don't think the State that says, for our comparable claims, we don't allow class action could -- could apply that--</text>

            <label>Mr. Scott L. Nelson</label>
            <text syncTime="3198.783" offset="12900561">--I think that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.435" offset="12907144">If Congress had provided that a class action was authorized in any court under a statute, New York couldn't prevent it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.824" offset="12936714">But my point here is that the "unless" clause is simply consistent with the rest of the statute, which makes clear that it applies to statutes from any source.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.679" offset="12980182">And that means that far from being in the heartland of Erie, this is far outside the heartland of Erie.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.250" offset="13002439">It's a case where the State court for procedural -- or the State's legislature, for procedural reasons, a balancing of the fairness and efficiency, the -- of class actions and those things that must -- that are requisite to the just, speedy, and efficient--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="3242.545" offset="13075581">--I can't see how that's so when they limit just a particular remedy or penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.234" offset="13102331">If they were saying, well, across the board we don't want class actions, I could follow your argument much better.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.804" offset="13132633">But when New York singles out penalties, it seems to be talking not about the efficiency and fairness of proceedings, but that it doesn't want penalty claims to be magnified.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Scott L. Nelson</label>
            <text syncTime="3269.029" offset="13181534">--Well, but that's an aspect of -- of the fairness and efficiency of proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.349" offset="13198775">Remember, of course, these are not claims for which the plaintiffs can't recover in State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.753" offset="13220404">They are simply claims that they have to proceed individually in State court to pursue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.289" offset="13242556">And the further point I would make is that the judgment that the -- that the New York legislature makes, that statutory penalties under any set of statutes are not appropriate for class treatment, is really contrary to the decision that the rules drafters of Rule 23 have made, which actually specifies the circumstances under which classes can be certified exactly by reference to the type of relief sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.176" offset="13362092">So it's a case where the rule and the State statute really do cover the same ground, to use the approach this Court took in the Burlington case, where it said that a State statute would not be given effect when the Federal rule occupies the territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.238" offset="13438370">And that's--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="3333.805" offset="13440669">But it didn't say that about Rule 59, and it didn't say that about Rule 41(b).</text>

            <label>Mr. Scott L. Nelson</label>
            <text syncTime="3338.541" offset="13459581">--And -- and Rule 59 doesn't occupy the territory of the standard to be applied, and Rule 41(b) as construed in Semtek just does not address preclusive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.718" offset="13516319">And finally, again, on the issue of ex ante forum choice, Congress, in the Class Action Fairness Act, provided jurisdiction so that Federal procedural rules would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.311" offset="13578700">If, as my friend argues, whether or not a case can proceed as a class action is a matter of substantive right, that principle can't be cabined to cases where the substantive -- or where the State standard precludes class actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.170" offset="13642125">If a class action, yes or no, is a matter of substantive right, that applies equally to State standards that -- that would promote class actions, and therefore, even though as -- as my friend says, it would be a Hanna issue, there would be an abridgement of a substantive right.</text>
