            <text syncTime="10.263" offset="147456">The Mobile-Sierra doctrine named for two over half-century old decisions of this court, concerns superintendents of power rate by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.861" offset="205866">This case is about the dimensions of that doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.937" offset="222166">When an electricity rate is set by freely negotiated wholesale energy contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.482" offset="252364">Mobile-Sierra instructs, the commission is to presume that the rate qualifies as just reasonable under the Federal Power Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.962" offset="294264">The presumption may be overcome however, if the commission determines that the contract rate seriously harms the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.098" offset="330836">For many years New England supply of electricity capacity was barely sufficient to meet the region's demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.801" offset="361660">The Federal Commission and New England's generators, electricity providers and power customers, made several attempts to address the problem, this case stems from the latest effort to design the solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.049" offset="422682">Concerned parties negotiated a comprehensive settlement agreement, their accord, which the commission approved, established rate-setting mechanisms, for sales of energy capacity, and provided that the Mobile-Sierra public interest standards would govern rate changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.467" offset="496347">Objectors to the settlement sought review in the DC circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.811" offset="513693">By and large, the Court of Appeals affirmed the commission's order but it agreed with the objectors on the point here at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.140" offset="550996">When the contract rate is challenged by non-cut contacting third parties, the court held, the Mobile-Sierra presumption that the rate is just and reasonable does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.355" offset="599897">We reverse that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.642" offset="608987">Mobile-Sierra's public interest standard we hold, applies to all challenges, to contract rates whether initiated by contracting parties or non contracting parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.835" offset="657784">For this conclusion, we rely heavily on this court's 2008 Morgan Stanley decision, which we announced three months after the Court of Appeals ruling in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.625" offset="708984">Morgan Stanley makes it unmistakably clear that Mobile-Sierra's public interest standard is not as the DC Circuit suggested independent of and sometimes at odds with the just-and-reasonable standard, rather the public interest standard defines what it means a rate to satisfy the just-and-reasonable standard in the contract context.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.159" offset="807100">We state three principal reasons for our opinion, first if the commission itself as adjudicator of great challenges must presume that contract rates resulting from fair arms length negotiations are just unreasonable and how can non-contracting parties escape that presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.317" offset="891737">Second, Mobile-Sierra as take account of third-party interest where the doctrine directs the commission to reject the contract rate that seriously harms the consuming public.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.343" offset="939802">Most critically, the DC circuit's confinement of Mobile-Sierra to challenges by contracting parties defeats the doctrine's animating purpose, promotion of the stability of supply arrangements which all agree is essential to the health of the energy industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.211" offset="1015244">A presumption applicable to contracting parties but inapplicable to all others who might challenge a contract rate could scarcely provide the stability Mobile-Sierra aimed to secure.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.281" offset="1071564">Whether the rates at issue qualify as contract rates for Mobile-Sierra purposes, and, if not, whether the commission had discretion to treat them analogously, our question is left open for the DC circuit's consideration on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.917" offset="1134153">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
