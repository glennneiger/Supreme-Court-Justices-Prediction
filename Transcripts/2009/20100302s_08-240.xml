            <text syncTime="9.870" offset="144865">Now these consolidated cases come to us on writs of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.998" offset="173390">The Petroleum Marketing Practices Act limits the circumstances in which petroleum franchisors can terminate a franchise or fail to renew a franchise relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.249" offset="222396">In this action Service Station franchisees brought suit, alleging that a petroleum franchisor had violated the act by constructively terminating their franchises and by constructingly failing to renew their franchise relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.315" offset="286657">Significantly, the franchisees asserted these claims, even though the conduct of which they complained had not compelled any of them to abandon their franchise operations, and even though they had been offered and had accepted renewal agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.281" offset="350501">For reasons set out in our opinion, we conclude that a franchisee cannot maintain a claim for constructive termination under the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act when the franchisor's allegedly wrongful conduct did not compel the franchisee to abandon one or more of the statutory elements of its franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.147" offset="433988">In addition, we conclude that a franchisee who signs and operates under a renewal agreement with a franchisor cannot thereafter recover for unlawful non-renewal.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.604" offset="479859">We, therefore, reverse in part, affirm in part and remand the case for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.184" offset="502115">The opinion is unanimous.</text>
