            <text syncTime="1355.570" offset="5527656">Then he files these motions in the State supreme court, which are opposed by the State as nullities because he is represented by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.065" offset="5557645">He then writes to the Florida Supreme Court saying, can you give me the information about your Web site -- maybe I can have some friends look up this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.515" offset="5591500">Because, of course, he knows at this point that there is a problem, and he knows that the triggering date for the filing in the Federal petition is the denial by the Florida Supreme Court and the issuance of the mandate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2030.797" offset="8228613">And then in the second trial, we had two Faretta hearings amounting to hundreds of pages in which the Florida Supreme Court then said, well, he wants to represent himself, but he can't conduct himself properly and so forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="2631.937" offset="10633132">In fact, this case -- you know, Lawrence, obviously -- it was 364 days before they even filed the State postconviction motion, and the lawyer in that case wasn't appointed for 300 days, and the State postconvictions process was sort of in disarray.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.601" offset="10687781">And all those things that the Court in Lawrence said are not supportable for equitable tolling apply equally here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.225" offset="10714321">The only difference in this case is this allegation about the -- the lawyer didn't communicate with his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.675" offset="10732084">Well, if that becomes the governing rule, all is lost, because attorney communication with client is perhaps even more amorphous a concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.781" offset="10768551">It could be based on verbal representations and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.357" offset="10782866">So we are very concerned that it not slip into that sphere where it can be easily manipulated for the advantage of getting some sort of delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.450" offset="10811183">And as I say, the analysis here of purpose of AEDPA, structure of AEDPA, and the burdens -- as I say, the burdens are important to the State and to the court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.207" offset="10866249">I was looking at that recent study, the 2007 study, that seemed to suggest that AEDPA is -- basically, when these cases are being filed in Federal district court, it has taken a year and a half to 2, 3 years for them to be resolved, and in this case keep in mind it took 18 months in the district court, 18 months in the Eleventh Circuit, and then further.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.777" offset="10948483">But that's allowing the invocation of this doctrine, not just in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.496" offset="10967395">We're worried about the noncapital context as well, that that will somehow put an end to the importance of what Congress enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.834" offset="10996757">There is a pre-AEDPA mentality out there, I'm afraid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.243" offset="11010341">And it's natural.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.961" offset="11013266">It's understandable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2728.287" offset="11018595">There's a pre-AEDPA mentality that there must be a remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2733.315" offset="11038657">And I think that sort of undergirds why perhaps most of the circuits have either assumed -- I think 11 have either assumed or adopted some sort of equitable tolling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.874" offset="11076901">I think they are waiting for this Court, which has left the question open to provide guidance on that issue, and we suggest that either there be no equitable tolling or that, if there is to be equitable tolling, on the circumstances of this case it has to be extreme attorney misconduct or incompetence, and that just simply is not established on this record.</text>

            <text syncTime="2912.659" offset="11756084">First, to clarify, the Respondent argued that Mr. Holland never asked to proceed pro se in the State court, and that's just incorrect, and it's flatly contradicted by their brief on page 43, where they write:</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.608" offset="11803836">"Holland moved to replace Collins with another attorney (whom Holland presumably thought would raise any issues Holland desired) or to proceed pro se if substitute counsel could not be appointed. "</text>

            <text syncTime="3131.576" offset="12631709">Well, but certainly -- but the other part of the test for equitable tolling is diligence, and I think, when -- when one looks at the -- at the body of case law that has developed since 1997 on the issue of equitable tolling and AEDPA, the vast majority of these cases are disposed on the fact that the Petitioner is indiligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.660" offset="12704016">Here, of course, the Respondent, if I heard correctly, is now conceding that the Petitioner was diligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.097" offset="12725854">And so there are certainly other ways to avoid even having to get to the question of exceptional circumstances; for example, just looking to the diligence prong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.452" offset="12763261">But here, where you have a failure to notify, you have the failure to heed the instructions from a client, you have the client saying you've lied to me, the client telling the State and the Federal courts this lawyer is not my agent anymore, I don't want him, I don't trust him, he has misled me, he has deceived me -- all of those factors certainly go to a consideration of whether equitable tolling should be warranted, and the problem here is that the Eleventh Circuit said no, categorically no.</text>
