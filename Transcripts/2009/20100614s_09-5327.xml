            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">Now the second case is Holland versus Florida that a Federal Habeas Corpus statute with certain exceptions gives a state prisoner one year from the time a state court conviction becomes final, until the time he must file a Habeas petition in Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.722" offset="212261">The answer in this case, two questions related to the running of that one year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.885" offset="236920">First, is that statute of limitations subject to the doctrine of equitable tolling?</text>
            <text syncTime="40.515" offset="267431">That doctrine means that a judge can toll i.e postpone the running of the statute for strong equitable reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.675" offset="304107">The doctrine would permit a federal judge to extend the one year Habeas Corpus time limit, provided there are sufficiently strong equitable grounds for doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.115" offset="349874">Eleven Courts of Appeals upheld that the doctrine of equitable tolling does apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.525" offset="371503">Federal statutes of limitations are normally subject to this kind of tolling and we can't find any good reason here for departing from that nor.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.466" offset="411314">To the contrary, the underlying subject matter Habeas Corpus is itself an equitable remedy and that fact makes application of the equitable tolling doctrine a particularly suitable thing to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.511" offset="463454">So like the others, we hold it applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.723" offset="476306">Second, did the Court of Appeals properly apply the doctrine in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="98.225" offset="498354">The Court of Appeals said that where a prisoner seeks equitable tolling on the ground that his lawyer behaved badly, the petitioner, the prisoner can succeed in showing he needs equitable tolling only if he proves quote bad, faith, dishonesty, divided loyalty, mental impairment and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.667" offset="584140">In our view this standard is too rigid.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.610" offset="595843">Equitable doctrines are by their very nature, more flexible and we believe that the Court of Appeals should have applied a more flexible test set out in our prior cases i,e equitable tolling may be justified, one, in extraordinary circumstances as long as, two, the petitioner has been indulged in seeking his remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.023" offset="685495">We believe there is adequate judicial precedent to guide this for courts in applying this more general standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.665" offset="712035">Given the facts of this case which we set out in our opinion, the petitioner maybe entitled to equitable tolling under this more flexible standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.134" offset="749965">So we remand the cases to the Court of Appeals so that it can reconsider them.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.563" offset="775670">Justice Alito has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.738" offset="796359">Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Thomas joins in part.</text>
