            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">Justice Breyer has the opinion of the Court this morning in case 08724, Smith versus the Spisak.</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="9.133" offset="141939">The respondent in this case, Frank Spisak, was convicted in an Ohio court of three murders and two attempted murders.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.369" offset="174853">He was sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.285" offset="182585">The Ohio Court rejected his appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.140" offset="193975">The Federal District Court denied his habeas corpus request, but then when he appealed that habeas corpus denial, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit accepted two of his constitutional claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.774" offset="240473">On the request of the state we have reviewed the Court of Appeals' decision insofar as it accepted those two claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.245" offset="270357">Now his first claim, the first thing he argued was that the jury instructions at the sentencing phase of his trial, instructions that had to do with how the juries should treat the factors that arguably were mitigating, he argued that those instructions were unconstitutional under this Court's holding in a case called Mills v. Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.917" offset="353113">Now Mills focused upon instances where defendant points to several different potentially mitigating factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.906" offset="381012">I mean, imagine he had a difficult childhood, he had horrific war service and he was also mentally disturbed and what Mills says is that the judge, when he tells the jury that they have to balance the mitigating factors against the aggravating factors, the judge should not leave the jury with the impression that it has to decide unanimously that a particular factor is mitigating.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.231" offset="482367">Suppose some jurors think that the childhood is mitigating, others might think the war service is mitigating, the judge cannot forbid the first group from considering childhood as mitigating, simply because other jurors disagreed about that one, they may think some other one.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.942" offset="557181">So after we read the, and I read the instructions in this case, we've compared them with those that were at issue in Mills and bottom line is we think the judge here did not commit the error that was at issue in Mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.936" offset="605142">So the Court of Appeals shouldn't have accepted that claim in our view and this is spelled out in the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.557" offset="631683">Spisak's second claim is that his lawyer provided constitutionally inadequate assistance of counsel when he made his closing defense argument to the sentencing jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.534" offset="671598">Again this is a matter reviewing the record and after doing it we don't express any view on the quality of counsel's argument, but we do conclude that there was no reasonable probability that a better argument would have made a difference, that is to say legally speaking the argument's deficiencies couldn't have changed the result if they did better.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.871" offset="764907">Now we spell out all this in our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.694" offset="780163">We reverse the Court of Appeals' determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.668" offset="792074">Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the result.</text>
