            <text syncTime="32.019" offset="234496">First and foremost, when crafting (h)(1) Congress specifically addressed pretrial motion delays and precisely defined that exclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="343.901" offset="1482000">Yes, Your Honor, but this rule wasn't confined to pretrial motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.519" offset="1496524">So even in those jurisdictions that follow the majority position at issue here, also to my understanding use (h)(7) to exclude intermediate delays before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.827" offset="1537797">In fact, in the government's brief, the government acknowledges that courts treat pretrial motion delays under either (h)(1) or (h)(7), and more specifically (h)(7)(B)(iv), which specifically speaks in terms of preparation.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.818" offset="1593699">And in fact, that's still further evidence that Congress specifically contemplated that preparation time would go under (h)(7).</text>
            <text syncTime="379.424" offset="1624106">Both (h)(7)(B)(ii) and (h)(7)(B)(iv) specifically direct district courts to consider the need for additional time for adequate or effective preparation.</text>

            <text syncTime="393.584" offset="1680739">(B)(ii) specifically refers to pretrial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.452" offset="1696204">So I think there, in that sense, there is evidence that Congress didn't think that a continuance under (h)(7) would refer only to a continuance of the trial date.</text>

            <text syncTime="608.752" offset="2541422">With respect, I don't think that's the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3382.002" offset="13634476">I would like to quickly address what I hope to be just four points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.906" offset="13662062">The first is the government's fundamental principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.842" offset="13673765">The fundamental tenet is that the specific treatment of pretrial motions in subparagraph (D) suggests no negative inference or limiting inference on the general standard of (h)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.500" offset="13716396">The flaw in that is evident by looking at subparagraph (h), which automatically excludes up to 30 days during which a matter is under advisement by the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.939" offset="13754222">If the government's reasoning is correct, subparagraph (h) just does not address or contains -- or suggests no negative inference on whether the 31st day of a matter being under advisement is automatically excludable under (h)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.579" offset="13808765">That's why there are settled canons in the statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.281" offset="13823603">We take the general standard, first of all, is it a proceeding?</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.483" offset="13836351">There is no pretrial motion proceeding until the motion is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.851" offset="13849830">Second, if you think there is any uncertainty as to what a proceeding is, well, look at how the enumerated subparagraphs that follow, what do they describe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.291" offset="13879609">One specifically addresses pretrial motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.576" offset="13892775">It has a starting point and it has an end point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.278" offset="13903538">That's the end of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.678" offset="13909180">But even if you think you want to look further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.813" offset="13917748">Well, is there any support in these enumerated subparagraphs for the government's rule that you would treat a defense request for additional time differently?</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.419" offset="13952125">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.302" offset="13955678">None of the enumerated subparagraphs distinguishes between defense requests and government requests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.089" offset="13978770">None distinguishes between routinely granted time or specifically alloted time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.976" offset="13998310">In fact, with respect to defense requests specifically, it was not lost on Congress how to -- how to treat government counsel and defense counsel differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.964" offset="14030284">In (h)(7)(C), which is about the end of justice exclusion, it specifies that the government cannot get an end of justice exclusion based on its inability to exercise due diligence in obtaining a witness or preparing.</text>
