            <text syncTime="112.096" offset="554862">Nobody is arguing that a noncontracting party is bound to terms that it didn't agree to in a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.844" offset="577849">The question is that, when a noncontracting party comes in to challenge the terms that two consenting, willing buyer and a seller have agreed to, what is the standard that should apply for that outsider to come in and challenge the rate the two people have agreed to?</text>
            <text syncTime="132.978" offset="638349">And Mobile-Sierra and Morgan Stanley all provide the answer, and that is the public interest standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="152.861" offset="717866">--It certainly applies to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and it would be a rather odd rule that the agency which is charged with Congress with administering the statute, has the greatest expertise, is bound by a more demanding standard, but an entity, an outsider with no such statutory mandate and no such expertise is subject to a lower standard when it comes in and asks for a contract rate to be overturned or abrogated.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.239" offset="811384">In fact, the court of appeals' ruling can't be reconciled with Mobile-Sierra's foundation and the need for contractual certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.269" offset="839492">The whole point is to provide certainty of contract so that companies can invest hundreds of millions of dollars in infrastructure projects without worrying that their contracts will be abrogated lightly after the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.342" offset="887766">But few could risk entering into such contracts and make those investments if any noncontracting party -- if the Mobile-Sierra doctrine applied only to contracting parties, the two people who signed the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="207.212" offset="935309">It's a bit much to say that the importance is to preserve the stability of two parties' contract, and, therefore, a third party who didn't sign the contract is bound to the two parties' contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="223.735" offset="1001347">The nonparty is saying: I'm adversely affected by that rate indirectly.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.050" offset="1014617">And we're all regularly adversely affected by contracts we didn't enter into.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.531" offset="1032589">The example we give in our brief is the theatergoers affected by the amount the theater pays for the movies and the popcorn and things like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.792" offset="1057562">But the question is what's the standard for that outsider to abrogate a rate the two, a willing buyer and a willing seller, have entered into?</text>

            <text syncTime="256.490" offset="1132377">Well, it assumes that anybody can challenge it.</text>

            <text syncTime="266.001" offset="1170411">So it applies to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which is the expert regulator, and it doesn't make much sense to have another -- another exemption for some category of not directly bound but sufficiently -- sufficiently affected parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="308.702" offset="1341252">But the general rule is that when a party comes in and tries to abrogate a contract, they have no greater rights to challenge the contract than the parties who entered it themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="915.804" offset="3769699">The reason that, in our view, the court of appeals was wrong in holding that there's a third-party exception to Mobile-Sierra is that, as I said a moment ago, the Court in Morgan Stanley recognized that Mobile-Sierra rests on a presumption that the rate negotiated between sophisticated wholesale businesses it can be presumed to be just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.313" offset="3851724">That's a feature of the rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.296" offset="3859665">There is no reason why the same rate for the same power could be just and reasonable when it's challenged by one person, but not when it's challenged by somebody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.683" offset="3897177">Second, the purpose of the public interest test under Mobile-Sierra is to allow contract modification only when it's necessary to protect third parties; that is, members of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.785" offset="3949631">So it doesn't make sense to say that that test is inapplicable whenever you have a challenge that's presented by one of those third parties or a member of the public.</text>
