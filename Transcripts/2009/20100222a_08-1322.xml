            <text syncTime="9.901" offset="145074">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: EAJA provides that in an appropriate case a court shall award to a prevailing party fees and other expenses incurred by that party.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.989" offset="193348">Every court of appeals to have addressed the question, including the court below, recognized that the plain meaning of EAJA's text directs payment of EAJA fees and other expenses to the prevailing party, and not her attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.109" offset="241831">Moreover, EAJA's relationship to the fees approved under section 406(b) of the Social Security Act and this Court's decisions in Jeff D. and Venegas in the section 1988 fee context make clear that Congress designed EAJA, like other fee-shifting statutes, to work within traditional attorney-client fee relationships, under which the attorney looks to the client for payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.255" offset="338484">Congress has also provided that, subject to exceptions not relevant here, all funds payable to the -- by the United States to an individual who owes a valid delinquent debt, Federal debt, shall be reduced by administrative offset.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.266" offset="394491">There is no dispute in this case that the prevailing party in this case, Ms. Kills Ree, owed a valid delinquent debt to the United States, received notice of that debt, had the opportunity to repay that debt or enter into a repayment agreement that would have avoided offset, failed to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.604" offset="463872">Congress directed in the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 that agencies and the Department of Treasury here shall offset such payments for delinquent debts.</text>

            <text syncTime="99.832" offset="504728">Isn't it true that the Commissioner of Social Security in the past paid EAJA awards directly to attorneys and that this is still done in cases in which the client has assigned the payment to an attorney?</text>

            <label>Mr. Anthony Yang</label>
            <text syncTime="115.359" offset="566899">That is true in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.311" offset="578706">Prior to 2005, the Treasury Department did not yet implement, fully implement, the Debt Collection Improvement Act with respect to certain payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.555" offset="619666">Here, these are miscellaneous payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.696" offset="628234">Treasury undertook the very large undertaking of computerizing the system to provide for offsets by tackling things like tax refunds, Federal benefits, most contractor payments, large payment systems that the government deals with on a day-to-day basis, and only in 2005 was able to implement miscellaneous offsets.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.594" offset="719768">Since 2005, the government has been offsetting EAJA payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.903" offset="745054">Now, in some circumstances where a debt is owed -- where an EAJA payment is made and a court, for instance, orders the government to pay the attorney, the government's policy is to check whether or not there is a delinquent debt a prevailing party owes, and if not, then the government may accept the assignment or comply with the--</text>

            <text syncTime="186.844" offset="852783">What gives the Federal Government the right to override State law on that issue?</text>
            <text syncTime="192.000" offset="873472">Suppose the situation was that another creditor would have priority over the attorney if the money had been paid directly to the claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.074" offset="909730">What gives the government the right, in effect, to override that by paying the money directly to the attorney, unless the government believes that this is payable to the attorney under -- under EAJA?</text>

            <text syncTime="214.271" offset="962497">--I don't believe so.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.628" offset="967931">There's two circumstances where -- that we might be talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.408" offset="979007">The first circumstance might be where a court has ordered the government to pay the attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.594" offset="1003771">That happens in a number of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.202" offset="1014220">When the government does not have a debt which is receivable from the prevailing party, it complies with the district court's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.418" offset="1047134">It simply does not have a dog in that fight.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.009" offset="1053508">When we have an assignment that the government recognizes, that's true in any kind of context where you might have an assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.976" offset="1093319">The government recognizes the assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.458" offset="1099274">If there are third-party creditors who are able to come in, they may come in and contest that.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.892" offset="1124979">They likely wouldn't have notice of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.249" offset="1130412">But it's no different than any other assignment that the government might accept, from a party, of the debt, and that is not an infrequent event.</text>

            <text syncTime="263.183" offset="1158102">What authority does a court have to direct that the money be paid to the attorney?</text>

            <text syncTime="269.200" offset="1182239">Well, it certainly doesn't lie in EAJA.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.180" offset="1194151">Courts have recognized that they retain equitable authority to recognize a constructive trust or an equitable lien to enforce an agreement between the attorney and client that the client will pay over to an attorney funds received pursuant to an award such as EAJA.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.747" offset="1264368">And in that context, although courts haven't been particularly clear in their reasoning -- they have cited to equity -- the courts have provided that when, for instance, an attorney represents a client pro bono or represents a prisoner pro bono, that the court will see to it that the payment actually received doesn't ultimately land in the hands of the client and enforces the understanding, either expressed or implicit, between the attorney and client that the funds that the client receives will go to the attorney.</text>

            <text syncTime="346.976" offset="1493305">Now, attorneys would likely come in, the attorneys for the prisoner, and ask the court to exercise its equitable authority to recognize a constructive trust over the fees that are actually paid to the party and prevent the party from keeping that money.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.999" offset="1557462">But a prisoner is ultimately no different than any other prevailing party under EAJA.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.747" offset="1580450">It is the prevailing party to whom Congress has directed the court shall award fees and other expenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="382.068" offset="1633740">The -- there's two things going on when a court recognizes an equitable trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.722" offset="1664355">First, it has to necessarily recognize the right of the prevailing party to the payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.593" offset="1691836">The prevailing party obtains the payment, and only once the prevailing party actually has title to the thing does equitable trust or a constructive trust attach.</text>

            <text syncTime="1541.926" offset="6273087">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: I'd like to discuss with you this morning four reasons why Catherine Ratliff, and not the government, is entitled to receive the fee for the legal services she performed, that Congress invited her to perform, to show that the government's position was legally erroneous and was not even substantially justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.289" offset="6390533">And my first point arises from your question, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.305" offset="6406625">You asked whether State law determines who has the priorities here in terms of offset, if I understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.034" offset="6437554">And the answer is that actually Federal law determines that, specifically the Debt Collection Improvement Act and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.970" offset="6477260">The Act requires mutuality of a debt between the debtor and the government before the government can offset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.858" offset="6512891">And the regulations, which I'll quote in just an instant, require that before offset can occur, the government must look to who has the beneficial interest in the payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.258" offset="6562419">In other words, who is entitled to benefit from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.616" offset="6571928">Specifically, 31 C.F.R. 285.5(b), which is quoted at page 45 of the red brief, defines, quote, "offset", close quote, as withholding funds to satisfy a debt owed by a payee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.280" offset="6638592">And 45 of our reply brief, as "the person entitled" -- as the person entitled to the benefit of all or part of a payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.257" offset="6718422">In other words, not the legal title holder if there is a difference, but the person with the beneficial interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1705.565" offset="6927715">Two responses, if I could, Justice Alito: First, the word "payment" gets thrown around a lot in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.202" offset="6954256">It can mean two separate things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.765" offset="6960525">It can mean who receives the payment first; in other words, who is the check mailed to; or it can mean who the check is ultimately entitled to -- who is entitled to benefit from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.121" offset="6997932">And the government's -- my second point is the government's reply brief at page 10 to 12 concedes that, but for the government's alleged right to offset, the attorney does indeed have the beneficial interest in the attorney's fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.145" offset="7065955">And the government gives three reasons, and only three reasons, why its alleged right to offset trumps the attorney's beneficial interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.235" offset="7102318">The first reason the government gives is the government says that the -- the constructive trust, which the government acknowledges exists in the -- in -- in favor of the attorney with respect to the fee payment, does not arise until the instant the fee reaches the client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.648" offset="7187999">And that's true, but that's not the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.381" offset="7198971">The point is the attorney had the beneficial interest in the fee, which had to precede the moment the fee reached the client, if it's payable to the client in the sense of "sent to".</text>

            <text syncTime="2296.701" offset="9292215">And the -- there are two points there, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.763" offset="9312486">I mean, EAJA fees -- I'm not claiming all EAJA fees are exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.228" offset="9330354">As I just said -- spoke with you, Justice Scalia, if the -- in a non-Social Security, non-Veterans case where the client has paid the attorney and then an EAJA fee comes down, that's clearly subject to offset.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.302" offset="9378628">You have to look to that regulation and who is entitled to the benefit of the fee payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.082" offset="9397750">And the reason that the Debt Collection Improvement Act doesn't address this in 1996 is that in 1996, the government had never taken the position that attorney fees were subject to offset in Social Security or Veterans cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.592" offset="9463787">And in fact, in 1996, there were three court of appeals decisions on the question of whether a creditor could offset a statutory fee award: Plant -- these are all of our briefs -- Plant, Fourth Circuit, 1979; Duncan -- I'm sorry, Plant is Fifth Circuit, 1979; Duncan, Fourth Circuit, 1989; Curtis, Eighth Circuit, 1993.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.629" offset="9551976">All those cases said that the creditor may not offset a statutory fee award against the creditor's debt because the fee is for the attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.081" offset="9581756">That's why Congress couldn't have conceivably thought to address it in 1996.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.060" offset="9601609">And some of the questions take me toward the point that you asked about before, Justice Roberts -- Chief Justice Roberts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.324" offset="9630762">And you suggested, or you said, that EAJA says: Pay to the prevailing party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.914" offset="9677051">If I heard you correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.255" offset="9682484">In fact, Your Honor, the language of the statute is, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.863" offset="9696904">"award to the prevailing party. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.315" offset="9710696">"fees and other expenses. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.718" offset="9724280">"incurred by that party. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.419" offset="9739118">And the two parts that we haven't really addressed yet are that what is awarded is attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.462" offset="9767225">And this "incurred by" language -- with respect to that attorney's fee language, "attorney's fees" has a traditional meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.977" offset="9793348">It's a meaning this Court has recognized in all those cases bullet-pointed at pages 19 to 21 of our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.051" offset="9821665">It's a fee earned by and paid to an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.456" offset="9835248">And in Gisbrecht v. Barnhart in 2002, this Court specifically described the real parties in interest in attorney's fees litigation as the attorneys, recognizing the reality that attorney fees go to attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.030" offset="9889583">In addition, the language "incurred by that party" -- what does it mean here?</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.341" offset="9910794">Well, outside of EAJA, it could mean -- it does mean, I think -- money the client takes out and pays to the attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.414" offset="9943082">We know in Social Security cases and Veterans cases it can't mean that, because that's illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.927" offset="9973175">That's a Federal crime if the attorney does it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.892" offset="9981012">So what does it mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.015" offset="9985505">Well, the government concedes at page 8 of its reply brief that that language "incurred by" a prevailing party is supported by the client's implied or express obligation to pay the attorney the fee received.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.445" offset="10059170">So this is where the government's argument is circular, I think, Justice Alito, in the sense that that EAJA award only may be made where the client has the express or implied obligation to pay the attorney.</text>

            <text syncTime="2850.194" offset="11506145">If it's 42 percent, that's quite a high number of cases in which the government's position is found substantially -- not substantially justified as well as legally erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.799" offset="11552643">In Veterans cases, it's even worse.</text>

            <text syncTime="3053.414" offset="12319075">--Well -- but during -- during Mr. Yang's argument, you asked about this -- this repayment agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.862" offset="12340914">The concept of a repayment agreement being any use to a lawyer who is thinking about taking one of these cases is fanciful for two reasons: Number one, SSI benefits by statute are limited to, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.842" offset="12396816">"aged, blind, and disabled people who have little or no money. "</text>

            <text syncTime="3085.944" offset="12449165">But the second reason it's fanciful is that the attorney only has 60 days from final agency action to file the case in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.534" offset="12483542">And, so, there is 60 days to, you know, meet with the client and try to get an answer out of the government.</text>

            <text syncTime="3111.919" offset="12553132">Finally, there's -- there's a critical point here that I need to get to, which is that I think Congress has told us exactly what this language means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.977" offset="12589286">Here's why.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.833" offset="12596705">In 1985, Congress enacts EAJA and uses this section 3 language which talks about who gets the fee, large or smaller fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.472" offset="12647278">Okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.236" offset="12650412">In 1992, Congress extends EAJA to Veterans claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.969" offset="12681341">And when it does that, in 38 U.S.C. 5904, Congress uses the same language, down to the exact commas in the same place, that it has done in 1985.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.461" offset="12743304">During this entire period -- and here's why that's important -- during that entire period from 1985 to 1992, and indeed continuing many years after that, but for purposes here, 1992, the administration is every time paying the attorney's fee to the attorney under EAJA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.202" offset="12838181">And so when Congress in 1992 uses the same language for Veterans EAJA claims that it used for Social Security EAJA claims 7 years earlier, Congress, as a matter of law, is incorporating the settled administrative construction--</text>
