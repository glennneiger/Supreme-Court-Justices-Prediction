            <text syncTime="7.021" offset="134499">The motion to reopen removal proceedings formally called deportation proceedings is an important safeguard to ensure the juxtaposition of immigration matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.467" offset="188312">Federal courts have reviewed administrative decisions denying reopening of immigration proceedings since at least 1916.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.568" offset="228749">This case concerns access to that check on executive determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.760" offset="253513">The petitioner, a citizen of Albania, moved to reopen his removal proceedings alleging new evidence in support of his plea for asylum.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.637" offset="293010">An immigration judge denied the motion and the Board of Immigration Appeals sustained that ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.448" offset="320282">Petitioner sought judicial review in the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.719" offset="341285">The court dismissed his petition holding that it lacked jurisdiction to review the board's determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.966" offset="374303">For that ruling the court relied on a statute barring judicial review of certain administrative actions, those specified as discretionary under the relevant part of the Immigration and Nationality Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.831" offset="441804">Although nothing in that act specifies the board's discretion to rule on reopening motions, a regulation published by the Attorney General does so.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.271" offset="487570">The Seventh Circuit held that the Attorney General's regulation suffices to insulate the board's decision from court oversight.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.151" offset="523097">We reverse the Court of Appeals judgment and hold that Federal courts retain jurisdiction to review reopening denials in immigration matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.020" offset="570535">That is so we explain because Congress reserved to itself and did not vest in the Attorney General authority to bar judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.006" offset="610450">Examination of the relevant statute’s text and context leads us to this determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.746" offset="637409">We note that other similar limitations of judicial review placed in the statute just before and just after the provision in question depends solely on statutory provisions not on any administrative regulation to define the scope of the limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.626" offset="716925">Our reading of the controlling provision keeps it in harmony with its surrounding provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.270" offset="743570">We also take into account the character of many of the immigration decisions Congress has expressly shielded from judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.556" offset="776694">They are in the main substantive decisions about an alien’s plea to remain in the USA, decisions made by the executive as a matter of grace.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.826" offset="821729">Decisions on reopening motions in contrast are not matters of grace, they are adjunct rulings concerned primarily with procedural fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.564" offset="864674">Finally two basic considerations strongly support our determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.192" offset="883169">First, separation of powers concerns appreciation that Federal Court jurisdiction is controlled by Congress not by the executive and second the familiar presumption favoring judicial review of administrative actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.288" offset="947639">Justice Alito has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
