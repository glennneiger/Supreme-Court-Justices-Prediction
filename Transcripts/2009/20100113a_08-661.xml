            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-661, American Needle v. The National Football League.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.341" offset="130759">Mr. Nager.</text>

          <turn speaker="glen_d_nager" startTime="7.246" stopTime="93.928">
            <label>Mr. Glen D. Nager</label>
            <text syncTime="7.246" offset="134416">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="9.870" offset="144865">In this case, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that an agreement of the 32 teams of the National Football League was immune from any scrutiny under Section 1 of the Sherman Act on the ground that the agreement allegedly fails the plurality of actor requirement of this Court's jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.690" offset="224172">The 32 teams of the National Football League are separately owned and controlled profit-making enterprises.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.297" offset="250608">Under this Court's decision in NCAA, as well as the Court's more general joint venture jurisprudence, those clubs are entities whose distinct agreements are, indeed, subject to Section 1 scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.056" offset="301599">The fact of the matter is there is a longstanding consensus, judicial and legislative, that agreements among sports teams about whether and how they will participate in the marketplace is subject to scrutiny under the Sherman Act, Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.456" offset="363248">The Court's decision in NCAA is most directly on point.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.952" offset="381221">In that case, the Court held that a policy of the NCAA that restricted the ability of member institutions of the NCAA to sell TV rights violated Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.668" offset="432107">Just as with the NFL, the decisions of the NCAA were ultimately controlled by the vote of its members, and for that reason, the Court held that the NCAA policy was a horizontal restraint.</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="93.928" offset="481113">But there was no joint venture with respect to the television rights, meaning there was no separate activity, other than the televising of the shows at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.374" offset="534925">Here, the Solicitor General is saying there is a joint venture, and it has to do with the licensing of trademarks, with their quality control, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.181" offset="574109">Isn't that a substantial difference?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="glen_d_nager" startTime="119.649" stopTime="198.463">
            <label>Mr. Glen D. Nager</label>
            <text syncTime="119.649" offset="584035">No, I don't -- I don't think so, because what we are asking about here is -- is the question of whether or not the agreement of the teams involves a plurality of actors.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.929" offset="625100">And just as in NCAA, the members' institutions -- because they control the operation of the NCAA and the policy that it was promulgating, there was a plurality of actors.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.799" offset="672643">So, too, here, the 32 teams of The National Football League have entered into an agreement and control the use, collectively, of the trademarks and logos of the individual teams.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.902" offset="724992">And for that reason, there is concerted activity that is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.009" offset="737426">Justice Sotomayor, the point that you raise might be of -- a point of difference that the NFL could argue in the context of an ancillary restraint analysis and the context of a rule of reason analysis, but it is not a point of distinction that they can argue properly in the context of the concerted conduct inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.190" offset="818197">The NCAA case simply applies the consistent teachings of this Court in cases like Sealy, BMI, and Copperweld, that separately owned and controlled entities entering into agreements, those agreements constitute concerted conduct subject to scrutiny under the antitrust laws.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="198.463" offset="899281">Did that cover everything that the NFLA does?</text>
            <text syncTime="203.958" offset="921224">Because everything is subject to agreement, it's all concerted action, so is everything under the Sherman Act, and then it goes to rule of reason analysis?</text>
            <text syncTime="215.574" offset="967722">Or are there some things that escape, entirely, antitrust analysis?</text>

            <text syncTime="221.966" offset="993322">Certainly everything in the -- that is challenged in this case, because this involves a restriction on the activities of the venturers themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.348" offset="1038775">But more generally, I would -- I would answer your question, Justice Ginsburg, to say that yes, that everything that these 32 separately owned and controlled teams joined together to do by -- in concert, by agreement, by consent, is a contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="267.552" offset="1175656">Well, I think we know the following, Justice Kennedy: That under this Court's rule of reason's jurisprudence, a plaintiff has to be able to plead an identifiable anticompetitive effect in a market in which the defendant plausibly has market power, and the -- the plaintiff also has to be one who can--</text>

            <text syncTime="288.605" offset="1259875">Well, my -- my hypothetical: Two or three teams which aren't particularly popular in the league are hurt by the rule change.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.012" offset="1285475">And notice -- notice, the owners sit around the room, they are liable for a conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.852" offset="1312852">I mean, this is serious stuff.</text>

            <text syncTime="304.227" offset="1322360">I don't -- and my question, really, was the same as Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.707" offset="1340228">Can you give us a zone where we are sure a rule of reason inquiry will be -- would be inappropriate?</text>
            <text syncTime="316.954" offset="1373247">We can take care of it on summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.624" offset="1379934">Because if you don't have some sort of Section 1 carveout for joint action, then -- then everything is under the rule of reason.</text>

          <turn speaker="glen_d_nager" startTime="325.982" stopTime="396.716">
            <label>Mr. Glen D. Nager</label>
            <text syncTime="325.982" offset="1409400">--Well, Justice Kennedy, let me answer your question in two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.854" offset="1424865">First of all, to the extent that the Court is looking for a zone, the concerted conduct doctrine is the wrong place to do it, because remember, if something is deemed not to be concerted conduct, it is a per -- then it's per se, not subject to section 1 and per se legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.500" offset="1491425">And I think for the Court's jurisprudence over the last 30 years, the Court has been trying to get out of per se rules and have a more focused inquiry into what the anticompetitive effects and procompetitive effects of a particular restraint are.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.074" offset="1557671">The concerted conduct doctrine would be a very blunt tool to use for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.258" offset="1574494">Now, that is not to say -- and I appreciate your question -- in the NCAA case itself, where conditions of competition and the like were raised, Justice Stevens' opinion for the Court says that in contrast to the TV restraint, these other types of rules and regulations of the sports league are presumptively competitive, procompetitive, presumptively favorable to consumers, because they are integral and bound up with the creation of the football venture itself.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="396.716" stopTime="419.361">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="396.716" offset="1692254">Well, let me give you another example that you mention in your brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.385" offset="1706987">The NFL teams agree among themselves regarding scheduling: They will play 16 games a year and they will have a playoff schedule and they won't play any other games.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.396" offset="1747007">Now, would that be a clear case under the rule of reason?</text>
            <text syncTime="413.066" offset="1757665">You mention and some of your amici mention that, for example, the English football leagues operate very differently.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="glen_d_nager" startTime="419.361" stopTime="463.794">
            <label>Mr. Glen D. Nager</label>
            <text syncTime="419.361" offset="1782847">Justice Alito, if I -- I may not have gotten all of your question, but let me answer it in two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.496" offset="1811372">The antitrust laws do not require joint ventures to maximize output.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.088" offset="1833733">They don't require joint ventures to maximize competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.978" offset="1845332">They simply prohibit people entering into contracts from unreasonably restraining trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.975" offset="1877305">So a mere agreement among the team owners that they would have a 14-game schedule rather than a 16-game schedule is not a prima facie showing of an anticompetitive impact, because all it's showing us is what the joint venturers have done with their own output.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.377" offset="1934879">They have -- you haven't alleged a market-wide reduction in output.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.890" offset="1948985">Now, if by your question you were saying in addition--</text>

            <text syncTime="470.256" offset="1986393">--What I -- what I was going to jump right to is: If in addition to changing the league schedule, the team owners in concert agreed to prohibit the teams of the National Football League from -- from playing any other games -- doing an exhibition game in Japan, the Redskins and the Giants playing another game -- that might show a market-wide reduction in output.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.479" offset="2103317">And the Court's decision in NCAA says very specifically that the most important condition of ensuring the competitiveness of joint ventures is ensuring the freedom of the individual venturers to produce output, increase output.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.645" offset="2164025">Now, that doesn't mean that a league rule of that type would be unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.971" offset="2177296">All I'm trying to suggest is if in addition to changing the schedule of games for the league, they also imposed a restriction on the individual venturers from producing additional games on their own, we might have something that looked more like a plausible rule of restraint--</text>

            <text syncTime="571.792" offset="2392545">Whether or not that horizontal restraint violated the antitrust laws, one would have to go through the following analysis, Justice Sotomayor: First, we would ask whether that restriction is an ancillary -- was an ancillary restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.255" offset="2450432">And an ancillary restraint, starting with Judge Taft, later Chief Justice Taft's, opinion in the Addison Pipe case, is: Is that restraint reasonably necessary to achieve the efficiency-enhancing purposes of the joint venture and is it no broader than necessary?</text>
            <text syncTime="601.622" offset="2511872">And if it is, then we would analyze that restraint by reference to its own procompetitive benefits and anticompetitive effects; we would analyze it by reference to the benefits of the joint venture as a whole.</text>

            <text syncTime="1662.477" offset="6755307">I think that by focusing on a rather mundane aspect of the NFL commissioner's powers, this may help to explain why the United States is not four-square in support of either party's theory in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.128" offset="6801910">Among the powers that is vested in the commissioner by the NFL -- by the NFL constitution is the power to incur expenses to carry on the ordinary business of the League, and this includes renting office space, hiring employees, and procuring supplies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.136" offset="6865962">And if the commissioner, pursuant to that delegation of authority, decides from which company he's going to -- to acquire paper for the League's offices or decides what the weight scale for secretaries in the League offices should be, our view is that that's the conduct of a single entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.255" offset="6926461">It may be that the commissioner's power to do those things is ultimately derived from the consent of the individual teams within the League, but once that consent has been given, once that authority has been centralized, then the commissioner's decision about a paper supplier or wages for employees--</text>

            <text syncTime="1736.260" offset="7050491">Or just say: Look, it's a joint venture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.336" offset="7062716">If Panagra creates a joint venture, of course they are going to buy things like office space and employees, so it's reasonable by definition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1803.495" offset="7319448">I guess my point is that if, for instance, a disappointed bidder for the paper supply conduct -- contract challenged this as a Section 1 violation and said the commissioner's decision to go to Staples rather than Office Depot was unreasonable because Office Depot was offering a better product at a lower price -- there are certainly decisions that the commissioner could make with respect to procurement of supplies or the setting of wage levels that would be unreasonable in a business judgment sense, in that they wouldn't effectively carry on the mission of the organization, but they wouldn't be unreasonable in the -- the Section 1 sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.730" offset="7472316">And the other thing I would say is that line of argument could have been made in Copperweld; that is, the Court could have concluded that--</text>

            <text syncTime="1848.008" offset="7497498">Well, look, your second criteria opens it up to attack in precisely the same way that my use of rule of reason does, because they are going to have to show it doesn't significantly affect actual or potential competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.722" offset="7556326">Therefore, they file their claim, they say they win under the second criteria, and it's precisely the same as a person filing his claim and saying it's unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.873" offset="7596868">We are only talking terminology, but what worries me about this is the terminology, because I think that the lower courts have taken Copperweld terminology and transferred it to a place where it does, I think, perhaps not belong.</text>

            <text syncTime="1900.660" offset="7708045">And the Court in Dagher didn't squarely resolve these questions, whether Section 1 applied, but it said that in pricing its products, Equilon, the joint venture, was acting as a single firm, a single entity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2400.791" offset="9708607">That's why I suggested that by 1963 -- or the mid-1960s, when NFL Properties was formed, there was venture formation at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.177" offset="9746119">At that point, what was the question?</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.724" offset="9756359">The question was: How should the League, how should the venture members, best promote the venture product?</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.377" offset="9778928">And the decision was made to use the licenses of their intellectual property as a promotional tool.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.421" offset="9803065">On that issue, the discovery and the record below was undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.089" offset="9821769">There is documentary evidence from the NFL Properties' articles of incorporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.620" offset="9839950">There is testimony from an NFL executive, Mr. Herzog.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.306" offset="9854683">And the best proof, if there were any question about that, is reflected in the -- the organic documents of--</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.617" offset="9883836">NFL Properties, which at the outset said that, if there were any revenues from the licensing activities, they would be donated to charitable and educational causes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.470" offset="9919258">Now, you know, Dagher confirmed the general principle, but if the venture is lawfully formed, the venture's decisions about how best to produce and promote its product are venture decisions, not the decisions of the venture members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.741" offset="9988430">But Copperweld provides the framework that decides the issue here, and neither Mr. Stewart nor Mr. Nager mention Copperweld, except in passing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.129" offset="10029913">Copperweld is the case by which this Court turned the page, if you will, on the formalism of prior cases, including Sealy, which Mr. Nager--</text>

            <text syncTime="2490.843" offset="10068783">Because you seem to treat this as though the NFLP was formed in 1963 and that was the end of it, but another description is: Well, it was formed, but then there were some teams that were not in it until later, and there were some other parts; that it has expanded.</text>

            <text syncTime="2545.038" offset="10285599">After 1970, there have been six teams, I believe, that have been added, essentially created, if you will, like Adam's rib.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.720" offset="10316319">They have been created from the other NFL clubs, but it's essentially the same venture.</text>

            <text syncTime="4021.330" offset="16190736">In 1999 -- 1919, when Judge Covington and Mr. Burling went to joint forces, they formed a law firm eventually.</text>
            <text syncTime="4030.904" offset="16229083">Ninety years later that venture decides on the prices, the rates that Mr. Ludwin and I will -- will decide for our -- will charge for our services.</text>
            <text syncTime="4040.883" offset="16268999">Sometimes that venture, the firm decides that we won't do business with a particular client or that we will limit our business to a particular client in a particular industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4050.724" offset="16308287">Nobody suggests that that decision of the venture, a lawful venture, is subject to Section 1 scrutiny as a violation of the Sherman Act constitutes a concerted refusal to deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4062.454" offset="16355203">But if Mr. Ludwin and I leave the -- leave the firm and we set up solo practices and then decide on what our rates are going to be, or then decide on what our clients -- what clients we will serve and not serve, that is an agreement between independent competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4081.117" offset="16429913">That's the fundamental difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="4083.632" offset="16439944">That is a fundamentally different situation between -- compared to the situation of the firm setting our rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4092.768" offset="16476515">And it reflects the intersection of Copperweld and Dagher.</text>
            <text syncTime="4095.752" offset="16488427">It shows how Dagher and Copperweld fit together hand in glove to demonstrate purposes that the NFL, for purposes of promoting its product, is a single entity.</text>

            <text syncTime="4110.710" offset="16548300">I'd just like to pick up on a question that Chief Justice Roberts asked me with a point that Justice Breyer made, which is that both the Solicitor General's position and the NFL's position are taking rule of reason concepts and trying to push them into the concerted conduct inquiry, which will have the effect, of course, of confusing courts that presently understand the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4132.688" offset="16636176">That's Justice Breyer's point about terminology.</text>
            <text syncTime="4135.074" offset="16645684">It also has substantive impact because of the way litigation gets conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4139.399" offset="16663030">As Mr. Levy has said, this case was litigated below at of the district court judge's direction only on the concerted conduct question, not on the -- the rule of reason questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4151.316" offset="16710677">So, American Needle didn't have the opportunity to conduct discovery and make proof about anticompetitive effects and to try to rebut the arguments that the NFL was making about procompetitive justifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="4164.293" offset="16762608">The NFL's argument is asking -- they are asking for a per se rule of legality for everything that the NFL does that is related to football.</text>

            <text syncTime="4181.054" offset="16829586">--On the -- the partnership example.</text>
            <text syncTime="4181.772" offset="16832512">Well, the partnership is -- is as follows:</text>
            <text syncTime="4183.597" offset="16839826">As -- as to the extent that there is case law on the subject, as with all joint ventures, the case law treats law firm partnerships as joint ventures and subjects them to the rule of reason, and every commentator whether it be Judge Bork or anyone else, has said, but, of course, law firms don't have market power so they couldn't possibly have anticompetitive effects on the market, and the rule of reason claim trying to challenge the rates at which a law firm sets its partnership rates wouldn't pass -- survive a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="4214.149" offset="16961975">With respect to his analogy to Dagher, the difference between the Dagher effects -- of course this Court didn't in Dagher didn't accept the argument that I made on behalf of Texaco and Shell that they should be treated as a single entity if, in fact, their formation was lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="4229.595" offset="17023833">This Court only ruled on the -- on the price fixing issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4232.532" offset="17035536">But the argument that was made in Dagher was if you had a wholly integrated joint venture, one in which there had been a complete pooling of relevant capital, a complete sharing of profits and losses and an enforceable non-compete agreement, in those circumstances the -- the owners of that joint venture were not like typical joint venturers, they, in fact, were like the share holders in a publicly held company, because their only interest at that point is in their investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4259.630" offset="17143892">They have no other economic interests that are affected by their ownership and control of that entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4265.315" offset="17166670">And at that point they could be treated as one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4267.452" offset="17175239">In Justice Thomas's opinion for the Court has some residence of that in it, but it specifically says it is only addressing it in terms of the per se rule.</text>
