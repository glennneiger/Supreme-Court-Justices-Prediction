            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">In case 08-678 Mohawk Industries Incorporated versus Carpenter, Justice Sotomayor has the opinion of the Court.</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="11.708" offset="153307">Section 1291 of the judicial code confers on federal courts of appeals jurisdiction to review final decisions of the district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.777" offset="193536">Although the final decisions typically are ones that trigger the entry of judgment, we have recognized that they also include a small class of Prejudgment orders that resolve important questions collateral to the merits of an action and are effectively unreviewable on appeal from final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.690" offset="273157">In this case, petitioner Mohawk Industries attempted to bring a collateral order appeal after the district court ordered it to disclose certain confidential information on the ground that Mohawk had waived its attorney-client privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.494" offset="336374">The Court of Appeals dismissed Mohawk's appeal for want of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.341" offset="355809">The question before us is whether disclosure orders adverse to the attorney-client privilege qualify for immediate appeal under the collateral order doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.700" offset="401262">We hold that they do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.624" offset="412965">We readily acknowledge the importance of the attorney-client privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.262" offset="431459">By assuring confidentiality the privilege encourages full and frank communications between clients and counsel which in turn promotes a well functioning adversarial system.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.040" offset="482555">The crucial question, however, is not whether the privilege is important in the abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.600" offset="504811">It is whether deferring appellate review until final judgment so imperils the vitality of the privilege as to justify the cost of allowing immediate appeal of all adverse, privilege rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.594" offset="560818">In our estimation, traditional post-judgment appeals generally suffice to protect the right of litigants and to assure adequate incentives for candid attorney-client consultation.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.205" offset="611286">Moreover when litigants are confronted with particularly novel or injurious privilege rulings, they have several potential avenues of immediate review apart from collateral order appeal, including interlocutory appeal, pursuant to section 1292 (b), a mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.218" offset="691325">In short, the benefits of extending the collateral order doctrine to attorney-client privilege rulings are likely to be minimal while the cost might well be significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.324" offset="735734">Authorizing litigants to pursue successive piecemeal appeals of all such rulings which disrupt the orderly progress of ongoing litigation and needlessly burden the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.062" offset="790695">Accordingly we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.860" offset="809921">Justice Thomas concurs in part and concurs in the judgment.</text>
