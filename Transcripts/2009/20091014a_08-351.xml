            <text syncTime="1587.115" offset="6453854">--Let me respond to that in a couple of steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.346" offset="6462840">And the first is to respond to your point about the incentives that local police departments may face.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.846" offset="6480812">There is no incentive to -- to hold property longer than necessary because, while the property is being held, there is no ability to access that property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.011" offset="6521459">If it's currency, for example -- as Mr. Castiglione pointed out, 85 percent of their seizures are -- the currency is held in a suspense account and is not accessible by the -- by the seizing government at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.587" offset="6563777">So the government has no interest in delaying longer than necessary, especially for cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.411" offset="6583108">The government has to take care of the car, maintain it in a lot, you know, preserve it from -- from harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.769" offset="6604528">Second, on the basic question of what is the government doing during this time?</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.672" offset="6620097">The government has a due process obligation, especially in an in rem proceeding like this one, which deals with a piece of property to which there may be competing claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.560" offset="6651653">The government has a -- itself has a due process obligation to notify everyone who has a claim to this property that it's in the government's custody and that there will be a proceeding to adjudicate the competing claims to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.665" offset="6700032">I mean, this Court in Robinson v. Hanrahan, a decision in 1972, held that Illinois under its forfeiture statute had violated due process by not providing notice to the owner -- to the registered owner of a car, because it sent notice to that owner at his address when in fact he was in the custody of the State of Illinois in a criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.907" offset="6781012">The State has an obligation to notify -- to investigate, especially after a seizure, even if it is a car which only a minority of seizures are -- even if it is a car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.387" offset="6818941">Identifying the driver is not enough to identify who has a claim to that car.</text>

            <text syncTime="2241.589" offset="9071741">The first is your opponents are saying, no, you shouldn't really address this issue now because there are three Illinois statutes which actually give them, anyone who wants it, a right to a hearing at least on probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.910" offset="9125031">And that's a matter of Illinois law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.114" offset="9133913">And although the statutes don't seem to say it, they might.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.940" offset="9145198">And the second is that this seems mixed up in my mind -- not necessarily your fault; it may be my mind -- but it seems to me there are two quite separate questions: when you are entitled to a final hearing of whether forfeiture is right or wrong; and whether you are entitled to a preliminary hearing on whether there was probable cause under the statute to obtain the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.102" offset="9241851">Now, that latter question I think might be impractical in many cases to work out until there's been a trial of an individual who's accused of a crime, which may be much later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.049" offset="9281661">But the former question is where I think you have a point, that there are five instances here in this statute where a policeman could seize a car without a warrant and he has to have probable cause under most of them nonetheless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.559" offset="9347699">So your clients might say: He did not have probable cause; I want a neutral magistrate to contest it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.072" offset="9373717">Now, in my mind that reaches -- that's a different question than the final hearing about who's entitled to the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.567" offset="9395660">And I also see the three statutes and now I see a case where here in front of me everything is mixed up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.176" offset="9422096">So I think -- perhaps I'm just seeing it that way, but those issues are mixed up confused and not separated out.</text>
