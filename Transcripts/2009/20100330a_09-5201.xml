            <text syncTime="391.508" offset="1671461">Why can't they just take 54 days at the end of every year that there is actual service, and that the time served, plus whatever number of days have been earned, you subtract it from the term of imprisonment?</text>

            <text syncTime="1004.062" offset="4121642">And you subtract that, too, so he gets another 10 days or so, or 15 days credit, and that's it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3333.022" offset="13437534">I think the point is that the language of the statute has remained unchanged, and for the last 20 years the bureau has interpreted that in a reasonable way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.020" offset="13469508">The language is unambiguous, but even if it weren't, at least the bureau's interpretation is reasonable, which is why 11 courts of appeals have deferred to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.518" offset="13503467">And so I take your point that they are serving more time than under Petitioner's interpretation, but I don't think that that policy rationale is properly before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.182" offset="13538158">It is properly before the bureau, which has found that policy consideration outweighed by other penological interests, and I think that's the judgment to which this Court should defer, not its own judgment about how much time these prisoners should -- should be serving.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.660" offset="13600016">And I do think it's important in that regard that Congress has returned the statute several times.</text>
