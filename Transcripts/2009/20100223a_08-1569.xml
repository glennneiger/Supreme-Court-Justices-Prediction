            <text syncTime="170.935" offset="789149">But -- but looking to the word "this subsection", Justice Sotomayor, is not -- is not useful for distinguishing among the elements and the sentencing factors, because of course there are, I think -- certainly this Court's holding in Harris says that the brandishing and the discharge provisions are sentencing factors.</text>

            <text syncTime="1562.525" offset="6355529">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think it's important at the outset to set the context for this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.715" offset="6388234">The government cannot point to a single defendant under this provision for the conduct at issue who has ever received more than 10 years in prison absent the use of a machinegun.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.737" offset="6428359">We cited a long string of cases in the O'Brien brief and the government's response in its reply brief was silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.891" offset="6453018">So, therefore, the government is here today claiming that it is entitled, based on the fact of a machinegun, to get 20 years more than any defendant that perpetrated this conduct has ever gotten, and indeed 18 more years than the government itself asked the district judge in this case for, once the machinegun provision was off the table, under the guise that this is nothing more than a sentencing factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.606" offset="6551865">We think that this Court's statutory interpretation jurisprudence as well, if necessary, this Court's constitutional jurisprudence foreclose such a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.462" offset="6587288">Let me start with statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.898" offset="6597005">On the government's theory in 1998, Congress stepped in and took a statute that made machinegun use an element and transformed it into -- into a sentencing factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.289" offset="6642563">In other words, Congress, without a peep, a mutter, or anything, and in -- in the course of doing something entirely different, which was reacting to this Court's Bailey decision, stepped in and took a fact that formerly had to be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt to trigger a 30-year sentence and left that same sentence in place but now allowed it to be proved to a judge by a preponderance, based on a presentence report, and, indeed, according to the government, also stripped away the mens rea requirement that attached to the statute when it was an element.</text>

            <text syncTime="1719.395" offset="6982990">Well, there's three very important differences between the machinegun provision at issue here and the discharge provision in Dean and the brandishing provision in Harris.</text>

            <text syncTime="2104.384" offset="8522961">And we've also cited in our brief several places where the government itself makes this -- the mirror image of the argument that I'm making in the post-Booker, Gall, Rita world, when judges deviate downward from the guidelines.</text>

            <text syncTime="2211.720" offset="8952310">You can look both at the intent of Congress and the effect of what it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.123" offset="8969864">The intent of Congress, at least as hypothesized by the Solicitor General, is laid out at page 33 of its merits brief, where it says: What Congress was intending to do here is, quote, "simplify and streamline guilt-stage proceedings" by relieving the government of its burden to prove this case -- this fact beyond a reasonable doubt to the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.085" offset="9041753">So that strikes one as, as this Court put it in Harris, an intent to evade the ordinary requirements in the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.406" offset="9071010">Then, as to effect, you can look at what I've also -- what I've already emphasized, which is that this sentence simply is not otherwise available, absent that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.095" offset="9109776">And that, on its own, ought to tell this Court that it's dealing with an element.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.297" offset="9126599">But if it wants to dig even deeper, it could -- it could describe it in terms of a 20-year increase over what the defendant would otherwise get or what, indeed, as we've said, anyone has ever gotten for this act, absent a machinegun.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.972" offset="9181351">It could do it in terms of percentage and say it's 83 percent higher; the Court used the phrase once, "tail wagging the dog".</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.960" offset="9209250">I don't think it matters exactly what exact avenue this Court would pick.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.095" offset="9229834">Again, if it were doing a constitutional analysis -- I'm speaking right now constitutionally instead of statutorily -- it would all end up at the same place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.701" offset="9260241">But I want to make sure that I understood your question also, with due respect to you, Justice Ginsburg, because what I was talking about was 10 years under (A)(iii), of course, is a sentencing factor, as this Court held in Dean, whereas under (B)(i), the same length of a sentence might be an element.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.078" offset="9341743">That was a matter -- that was a statutory answer, and I think, as a matter of statutory construction, which is, of course, the first thing you're going to address in this case, what we think we can win on without even reaching the constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.903" offset="9385002">And the differences would be, apart from the same sentence, you have the structural difference that I've emphasized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.307" offset="9410602">You have the tradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.607" offset="9415826">And let me say a word about tradition, if I might.</text>

            <text syncTime="2333.544" offset="9439545">When this Court applies the tradition canon that it established in Almendarez-Torres and Castillo, I don't know why you have to look any further than Castillo itself to answer the tradition question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.768" offset="9484476">In Jones, as this Court put it, the reason we look to tradition is because if it's a close case, we're going to not assume that Congress intended a radical departure from past practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.909" offset="9529093">Well, the past practice here is absolutely unequivocal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2392.396" offset="9674961">Because Congress, we know, intended it to be an element at least until 1998.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.533" offset="9695545">But I think that even -- even if you were to step back from the Castillo analysis itself and the Castillo factors themselves, you would also, I think, do well to give -- again, not dispositive, but -- but careful treatment to Castillo, because Congress steps in, of course, and amends statutes all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.197" offset="9782168">They step in and they amend one portion of a statute, and while they are at it, we know from the manuals that we've cited and from the examples in the back of the O'Brien brief that Congress often, while they're amending one part, they reorganize or reword other parts of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.973" offset="9841309">And this Court, across its statutory interpretation jurisprudence, within criminal law and outside, has always said that once we say the law means something, we're not going to assume that Congress changed the law unless we get some sort of clear indication from Congress that it -- that it intended to change the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.120" offset="9921870">Now, here, as I think has been emphasized, but I'll just reiterate, there's not a peep of anything in the legislative history or anything to suggest that Congress was -- was intending to change the law here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.345" offset="9966801">And, in fact, it's not even a mere silence case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.678" offset="9976101">We know quite clearly and affirmatively that Congress was intending to do something entirely different, which was respond to this Court's Bailey decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.701" offset="10004208">But even in the language -- and the only thing I think the Solicitor General even has for it in this case is the language and structure, which are some different words and different placement that it can at least build an argument off of, because the other four of the five Castillo factors are entirely unchanged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.543" offset="10071604">But even the language, we submit, is a far cry from the kind of change this Court ought to require before it does a 180-degree switch as to what it had said the prior law meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.101" offset="10117789">Just for purposes of stability in the law, if nothing else, I think this -- it behooves this Court to take its prior decisions seriously and to -- and to engage in a dialogue with Congress that encourages Congress to be clear when it wants to change what the prior law is.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="2542.041" offset="10273583">They -- as you say, they were not in the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.325" offset="10286749">My understanding is that judges as -- on an ad hoc basis, would have treated those as sentencing factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.229" offset="10310363">And what Congress did -- when it came in to respond to this Court's Bailey decision, I think it codified all of the different manners of using the gun in the context of one of these crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.120" offset="10357906">So it not just dealt with, yes, possessing ought to be covered, but it talked about other manners, brandishing and discharging.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.191" offset="10386223">In Castillo, this Court emphasized again the big difference between manner of using a gun and the type of firearm which lies at the core of this offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.647" offset="10424048">If I would turn -- if I would leave the Court with nothing else, let me emphasize again to the Court the difference between this statute, which I think the government wants you to think is no different in intent, effect, or operation than the two that this Court prior -- dealt with in Harris, as a matter of both statutory construction and constitutional law, and in McMillan, as a matter of constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.214" offset="10530314">What this Court emphasized in both of those cases was that there was a preexisting law on the books that criminalized certain activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.451" offset="10559258">And then a legislature later stepped in and set a mandatory minimum for a particular fact that could accompany the crime at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.224" offset="10594367">And it did so in a very minor way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.609" offset="10607846">For example, in Pennsylvania, the various crimes covered by the firearm mandatory minimum in that case gave 10-, 20-year sentences routinely, and all the Pennsylvania legislature did was step in and say: If he uses a gun, we want at least 5 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.101" offset="10665838">And in Harris, as I've just emphasized, I think, in discussing with Justice Scalia, the Court dealt with a bump of just 2 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.874" offset="10696871">Again, what judges were already customarily doing, I think, under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.492" offset="10715366">Here, this is entirely and dramatically different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.794" offset="10728636">Here, the fact allows a sentence -- indeed, requires a sentence -- that is 20 years longer than anyone has ever gotten for this conduct at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.134" offset="10765939">That is a difference not just -- it's not a minor difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.787" offset="10784538">It is a categorically different difference that we think is enough, combined with other principles of statutory and constitutional interpretation, to -- I'm sorry, statutory interpretation to resolve this case on the statute alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.011" offset="10833439">But if you need to look to the Constitution, we think that the Sixth Amendment, either as the bright-line rule articulated in Apprendi dictates that any fact that allows a greater sentence than the defendant could otherwise receive is subject to the Sixth Amendment, or sort of plain, pure due process, tail-that-wags-the-dog analysis, that this Court emphasized in McMillan -- either of those would be enough, and indeed require, a finding of unconstitutionality here and a finding this Court can avoid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.565" offset="10963634">And if nothing else, Justice Breyer, I would say that we think that this case can be resolved on statutory grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.302" offset="10990592">We think there are narrower constitutional arguments that would either require reading it narrowly or striking it down if you had to, on even narrower grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.443" offset="11035209">But if nothing else, then we would ask this Court to revisit Harris, if necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.562" offset="11055689">We don't think it's necessary to resolve the case for us here, but we think that would be appropriate if it -- if it needed to get there.</text>

            <text syncTime="2744.335" offset="11082752">It's a collateral point: Does the government have to show, or does the -- don't you have to find that the machinegun is operable?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="2752.238" offset="11114412">I assume so, but I don't know the specific answer to that, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.725" offset="11132280">What there is a dispute about, of course, is whether the -- if it were a sentencing factor, whether the government has to prove knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.414" offset="11171046">And we do emphasize that that would be an alternative basis for this Court to decide this case, by saying you at least have to prove knowledge even if it's a sentencing factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.354" offset="11206886">And let me just leave you with this, unless there are any further questions: The government makes a couple points in its reply brief suggesting that certain arguments were not preserved or made properly in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.810" offset="11244711">The knowledge argument that I just referred to is raised in the brief in opposition for Mr. O'Brien at pages 23 to 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.648" offset="11280029">So under rule 15 of this Court, that argument was properly presented at the cert stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.052" offset="11297583">You will also find that argument at pages 34 to 37 of the Joint Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.354" offset="11314824">Also with respect to the Sixth Amendment substantive reasonableness as-applied argument, the government suggests that for some reason, that would be inappropriate for this Court to reach or rely on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.479" offset="11359336">Again, we disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.181" offset="11366128">First of all, we can't understand why it would be inappropriate to reach or rely on that constitutional argument, whereas it is apparently appropriate for this Court to address the McMillan argument or the "overrule Harris" argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.553" offset="11411581">They're all three constitutional arguments that are present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.691" offset="11424225">And, again, if there were any doubt they were raised below, pages 38 and 39 of Mr. Burgess's First Circuit brief, pages 32 to 35 of Mr. O'Brien's First Circuit brief, and in the brief in opposition, which the government, in its reply brief at the cert stage, responded to without claiming any error or any waiver problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.068" offset="11497681">So we think absolutely all the arguments that are made in the blue -- in the red briefs are clearly before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.889" offset="11520982">If the Court has any additional questions, I would be happy to entertain them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.258" offset="11534461">Otherwise, I am prepared to submit the case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Benjamin J. Horwich</label>
            <text syncTime="2864.328" offset="11562778">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.114" offset="11565913">Justice Kennedy, just to answer your question: The definition of 921(a)(3) includes a weapon that is designed to expel a projectile, so one that can be restored to do so also qualifies as a firearm for purposes of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.473" offset="11635294">My friend made the comment that brandishing and discharge would have been treated, under the old statute, as sentencing factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.479" offset="11663297">But they couldn't be, because the old statute had determinant sentences, and brandishing and discharge weren't relevant to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.399" offset="11687016">So there wouldn't be a higher sentence for those.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.083" offset="11693704">And that -- that reveals sort of a basic flaw in this notion that somehow those can be treated as sentencing factors, but Congress wasn't embarking on a general litany of sentencing factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.976" offset="11745322">Congress inserted those to be sentencing factors, as the Court recognized in Harris.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.427" offset="11763085">Then what it did is move the firearm-type provisions next in line, because that's what it thought of them as, not as elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.366" offset="11790879">It moved them away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.700" offset="11796208">And then it goes on to recidivism, which is also a sentencing factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.235" offset="11810314">So the overall result, then, of the statute is that it's sort of an instruction manual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.139" offset="11829959">The first thing that comes up is the elements; that's what the judge uses to charge the jury or take a plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.758" offset="11848453">That ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.543" offset="11851588">The statute takes up the next topic, which is sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.578" offset="11863709">The judge needs to ascertain the limits of his discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.030" offset="11873531">And then the statute ends with some technical considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.066" offset="11885652">That -- that approach is entirely in line with the sentencing factor tradition, and that's -- that seems to be what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.220" offset="11918252">But my friend's understanding of the statute is sort of this disorganized jumble, and he's making very much of the idea that when Congress revises a statute, it tries to confront -- it tries to make it better, on his view.</text>

            <text syncTime="2970.479" offset="11987320">When I looked at the statute itself, I thought, well, all that's happened here is nobody's thought of this issue at all; nobody's read Castillo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.835" offset="12012711">What really happened is somebody in the legislative drafting section was focusing on what he said they were focusing on, Bailey, and then they have a form manual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.755" offset="12044476">So they followed the form manual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.607" offset="12051895">Now, is there anything to suggest that isn't what happened?</text>

            <text syncTime="2988.707" offset="12060254">Well, there is no legislative history, but there is the fact that the form manual says if you're going to embark on this, here are some ideas for how to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.712" offset="12088257">But it doesn't tell you -- it does not tell Congress substantively what it should do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.764" offset="12104453">Someone had to make a choice to write that introductory language,</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.799" offset="12116574">"a person convicted of a violation. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.982" offset="12125351">And that is what Congress passed, and so Congress intended that those things, firearm type, that follow that are relevant after the person has been convicted of a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.322" offset="12162759">One final answer to your question Justice Scalia, about the life maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.309" offset="12178641">This Court held -- in Custis v. United States interpreted the same language, "not less than" a certain number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.880" offset="12200897">That's in 924(e) of the Armed Career Criminal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.932" offset="12217198">The Court held that to have a life maximum sentence there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.950" offset="12229214">So I think the same would apply -- the same would apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.069" offset="12241648">And so the final thing I would want the Court to take away then from this is that Congress is using firearm type to channel a sentencing judge's discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.793" offset="12284594">The life maximum exists in all cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.893" offset="12292953">There have been cases sentenced up to life even where that was far above the minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.113" offset="12309880">And when Congress does that, it uses a sentencing factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.815" offset="12324718">It doesn't create greater and lesser included offenses for the jury; it does it by addressing the person who is in charge of sentencing, which is the judge, and giving him a rule of decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.707" offset="12364215">That's what the text and the structure indicate here and that's what the Court should hold.</text>
