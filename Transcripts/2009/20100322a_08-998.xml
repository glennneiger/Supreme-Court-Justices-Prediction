            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-998, Hamilton, the Chapter 13 Trustee, v. Lanning.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.237" offset="134416">Mr. Hamilton.</text>

          <turn speaker="jan_hamilton" startTime="8.270" stopTime="60.203">
            <label>Mr. Jan Hamilton</label>
            <text syncTime="8.270" offset="138491">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="10.189" offset="146223">The Tenth Circuit and Stephanie Lanning were wrong in ignoring the new Chapter 13 means test contained in the 2005 amendments to the Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.395" offset="183003">The amendments to the 2005 Bankruptcy Code were intended to reduce judicial discretion by inserting a formula rather than the judicial discretion that had previously been accorded to judges and to the litigants.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.369" offset="230860">Stephanie Lanning fell afoul of the means test because during the first 2 months of a 6-month lookback period, which I will explain in a moment, she had more income than what she had in the rest of the 6-month lookback period.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.693" offset="280179">That income was from a buyout from her former employer, Payless, and distorted what her income appeared to be during that 6-month period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.199" offset="314243">Because of that, the amount which the means test showed that she would be required to pay to her creditors was more than she could actually pay.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="60.203" offset="346216">Which means -- which means what?</text>
            <text syncTime="62.721" offset="356352">What is the consequence of that?</text>
            <text syncTime="64.590" offset="363771">You concede that on the strict application of the 6 months she -- her income is much too high for her possibly to pay the creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.766" offset="420509">So what happens to her?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jan_hamilton" startTime="80.066" stopTime="132.365">
            <label>Mr. Jan Hamilton</label>
            <text syncTime="80.066" offset="425733">What happens to her and what could have happened to her may be two different propositions, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.187" offset="450184">In the first place, there are two parts to that 6-month lookback period, which are found in 101(10A) of the United States Bankruptcy Code -- and the statutes, by the way here, are found at pages 83 through 96 of the petition appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.430" offset="511101">101(10A) has a first part which defines the 6-month lookback period as being 6 months prior to the filing of the date of the petition -- actually, the end of the month prior to the filing of the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.321" offset="562719">Congress's thought was, it seems, that that would be more representative of what an individual's actual income would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.725" offset="588319">There is a second part to that 6-month lookback period which says essentially that the debtor can move that 6-month lookback period by not filing certain papers with the court.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="132.365" stopTime="153.129">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="132.365" offset="634922">That's -- can you explain that?</text>
            <text syncTime="133.901" offset="640982">It seems very odd.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.951" offset="645266">It says she can do that if she doesn't do what the statute requires her to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.805" offset="672643">I mean, she's supposed to file that schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.590" offset="679748">She's required, the statute says, to file it.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.209" offset="694272">But she gets an advantage if she doesn't do what she's instructed to do?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jan_hamilton" startTime="153.129" stopTime="179.946">
            <label>Mr. Jan Hamilton</label>
            <text syncTime="153.129" offset="717887">The part of the statute that you are referring to is under 523, and it essentially says that debtor shall file -- 521, excuse me -- shall file certain schedules and that would include the income and expense schedules, Schedule I and Schedule J.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.372" offset="774938">And certainly the court has the ability, under that statute, to extend the time or to excuse the performance of a debtor in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.859" offset="804822">So there's nothing incongruous about that wording in the statute.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="179.946" stopTime="197.392">
            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="179.946" offset="825198">What do you -- what do you do with the contention that the court is bounded by other requirements such as the timing of the meeting of creditors and the plan confirmation, that that binds the district court from resetting it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jan_hamilton" startTime="197.392" stopTime="239.985">
            <label>Mr. Jan Hamilton</label>
            <text syncTime="197.392" offset="894997">Certainly all of those time frames can be moved, Justice Sotomayor.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.360" offset="910879">There is -- again, the actual timing of the confirmation hearing in a Chapter 13 case may be fluid, although there are certain time limits for the first meeting of creditors and for when the first -- when the confirmation hearing is held.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.286" offset="966572">They can be extended, just as the confirmation hearing would be in a Chapter 12 or in a Chapter 11 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.590" offset="987784">So the idea is the second part of 101(10A) allows the debtor to say: Your Honor, my 6-month time frame immediately prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition is not representative of my income; I would like to have that time frame moved.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.100" offset="1049851">And that time frame would appear to be moveable up to the confirmation hearing.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="239.985" stopTime="261.167">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="239.985" offset="1065315">Moveable to where?</text>
            <text syncTime="241.671" offset="1072107">What -- what would be -- you say -- this time period, the statutory -- the 6-month lookback, she has these 2 extraordinary months.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.811" offset="1120695">So now she's going to say: Court, please change the period.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.882" offset="1140966">Change it to what?</text>
            <text syncTime="260.165" offset="1146086">Anything she wants?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jan_hamilton" startTime="261.167" stopTime="269.071">
            <label>Mr. Jan Hamilton</label>
            <text syncTime="261.167" offset="1150056">No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.917" offset="1153087">That would be up to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.584" offset="1159774">It would be discretionary with the court, as the language suggests in the second part of 101(10A).</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="269.071" stopTime="297.590">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="269.071" offset="1181717">But isn't it the case that before the 2005 amendments, bankruptcy courts were recognized as having discretion in calculating projected disposable income to take into account changes in the debtor's income after the filing of the plan, and shouldn't we presume that -- that Congress intended to continue essentially the same regime, unless Congress provided some clear indication that they wanted to depart from it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jan_hamilton" startTime="297.590" stopTime="345.004">
            <label>Mr. Jan Hamilton</label>
            <text syncTime="297.590" offset="1295820">Certainly prior to the 2005 amendments, your assessment is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.761" offset="1316509">The court had the discretion to be able to assess the debtor's situation, use its discretion to determine what income and expenses should be calculated in determining whether or not a debtor was paying his or her best efforts under 1325(b)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="319.521" offset="1383487">Here, there is a clear formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.473" offset="1391323">And if you read these -- there are three, three key statutes that form a triangle in order to give me the conclusion that I make and that I suggest to Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.394" offset="1422984">And that is, we start with 1325(b)(1), which is the statute that brings into play the disposable income and projected disposable income requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.084" offset="1465720">"Disposable income" is now defined as "current monthly income".</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="345.004" stopTime="378.309">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="345.004" offset="1485469">It is odd that Congress provided this very detailed formula and -- and that they would provide such a detailed formula and then say: But the bankruptcy court can modify that based on a projection.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.248" offset="1538445">But still we have the word "projection -- projected".</text>
            <text syncTime="361.031" offset="1549521">And your interpretation leads to very strange, really absurd results; isn't that true?</text>
            <text syncTime="368.036" offset="1577524">And you have to devise some really elaborate escape strategies in order to allow a debtor to avoid those very strange results.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jan_hamilton" startTime="378.309" stopTime="407.079">
            <label>Mr. Jan Hamilton</label>
            <text syncTime="378.309" offset="1618693">Respectfully, Justice Alito, I don't any agree with the assessment that -- of what you just stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.863" offset="1636874">Essentially, this formula allows the bankruptcy court to move that 6-month period of time, not to ignore the formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.367" offset="1662892">The formula's there.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.167" offset="1666132">The formula defines "current monthly income".</text>
            <text syncTime="393.569" offset="1679715">From the current monthly income then is subtracted reasonable and necessary expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.389" offset="1698941">And formerly, under the old law, the '78 code, those reasonable and necessary expenses contained a few specifics, but largely it was up to the court to determine them.</text>

          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="407.079" stopTime="412.982">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="407.079" offset="1733736">But you say that that can be done only if the debtor fails to file a form that the debtor is required to file; isn't that right?</text>

          <turn speaker="jan_hamilton" startTime="412.982" stopTime="421.136">
            <label>Mr. Jan Hamilton</label>
            <text syncTime="412.982" offset="1757351">In -- under 101(10A), the second part, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.184" offset="1774174">But I think there are -- there are some other -- other avenues for the debtor that are statutory.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="421.136" offset="1789952">What do you do with the situation in which the change that is projected to occur and in fact may be almost certain to occur is one that causes an increase in the debtor's income?</text>
            <text syncTime="432.008" offset="1833420">Let's say the debtor was unemployed through almost all of the lookback period and then just before the filing of the plan gets a job with a good salary.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.049" offset="1873648">You would say that the -- if you just look at the lookback period, the debtor would be required to pay practically nothing.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jan Hamilton</label>
            <text syncTime="452.238" offset="1914399">Well, there -- there are a couple of avenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.023" offset="1921505">There is a new statutory provision under 1325(a)(7) that says the plan must be filed in good faith and -- I'm sorry, the petition must be filed in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.963" offset="1961315">1325(a)(3) provides that the petition must be filed in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.367" offset="1978870">So we still have the good faith analysis that the debtor's actions may be subjected to even after the plan is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.621" offset="2003947">And that would be as trustee the avenue that I would approach is that, even though the schedule formula may have been complied with, that if there had been a drastic increase in income post-petition, then that -- that should need to be accounted for.</text>

            <text syncTime="488.094" offset="2057759">Counsel, why -- what commends going through all these machinations, all of these alternative ways of avoiding absurd results?</text>
            <text syncTime="498.636" offset="2099973">Isn't the answer simply that we just narrow the circumstances in which a court can deviate from the statutory formula?</text>
            <text syncTime="510.444" offset="2147203">I mean, it's not -- even before this change, it wasn't that the district courts could at whim change the projected income.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.233" offset="2186386">They have to have a clear ground to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.703" offset="2204254">Why is that inadequate to protect the interests that Congress had in creating this new formula for income and expenses?</text>

            <text syncTime="578.652" offset="2420025">Good faith is almost incapable of definition, yet every circuit in the United States has a laundry list of factors that are taken into account for good faith.</text>

            <text syncTime="637.523" offset="2655545">That was a term that was in the 1978 code and is carried over into the present code.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.494" offset="2675399">How it was applied is vastly different.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.462" offset="2687310">The dispute under the prior law was over whether or not the court could take into account changes in circumstances which were likely to occur post-confirmation.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.402" offset="2727016">And so we had cases like the Anderson v. Satterlee case out of the Ninth Circuit and the Midkiff case out of the Tenth Circuit that disagreed as to how that ought to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.889" offset="2760976">In the Anderson v. Satterlee case the Chapter 13 trustee requested that the debtor sign essentially a pledge that they would devote their excess income to the plan, and the Anderson court said: Wait a minute; there is another statute at issue here and that is 1329.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.933" offset="2825132">1329 allows for the modification of the plan after the plan has been confirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.587" offset="2847807">Prior to the confirmation of the plan, the debtor still has the ability -- and this ties in with some of the comments made by Justice Alito -- the debtor still has the ability to amend the plan under 1323.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.495" offset="2899425">So all of these statutes need to be read together to show what the result is.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.716" offset="2916248">Now the question is not whether or not changes should be taken into account for post-confirmation that may be likely to occur, but whether or not the court may deviate from the statute where Congress has said this is how we want you to determine current monthly income, therefore disposable income and consequently projected disposable income.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas C. Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="1681.419" offset="6831062">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.586" offset="6839735">The Court, I think, has the parties' arguments very well in hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.906" offset="6853005">I think the -- the one point that I can hopefully address, and it is I think the hardest part of our case, is to address the issue that Justice Alito raised, and that is, is there an anomaly in the fact that in BAPCPA Congress added the 6-month period, which would suggest perhaps that Congress was trying to lock in a particular period that we would look at.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.284" offset="6926566">And the answer to that question is no, and I want to take you to the relevant statutory provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.903" offset="6945061">Everything is going to be in the cert petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.419" offset="6955092">I am going to start in the petition appendix at 91, which is 1325, which is the operative provision here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.640" offset="6979960">And 1325(b)(1) tells us that if the trustee or a creditor objects, then as of the effective date of the plan it's only going to be confirmed in subsection (b), which is the third full paragraph on page 91 is going to control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.518" offset="7039519">The plan has to provide that all of the debtor's projected disposable income to be received in the applicable commitment period beginning on the date the first payment is due under the plan will be applied to make payments to unsecured creditors under the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.592" offset="7091764">And the thing to note first about that provision is that it, too, sets a timetable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.444" offset="7107229">It's not just projected disposable income, but it's projected disposable income of a very particular type, to be received in the applicable commitment period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.067" offset="7141710">So unless there is something particularly strange about the definition of "disposable income", Congress specified a period that the income is going to be measured in, and that's over the course of the plan; the word "projected" tells us to get a realistic estimation of what that amount of money's going to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.393" offset="7198971">Now, my friend makes the point that disposable income after BAPCPA is a defined term; the definition comes in the next paragraph; it's subsection (2), 1325(b)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.749" offset="7236378">For purposes of this subsection the term "disposable income" means current monthly income received by the debtor subject to some deductions and then the expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.938" offset="7273159">So then we have to go to the definition of "current monthly income".</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.223" offset="7282354">Current monthly income is in 101; it's at page 83.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.859" offset="7296878">That's where we get the 6-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.413" offset="7311088">And it tells us that current monthly income is the average monthly income from all sources, so it's very encompassing, without regard to whether such income is taxable income derived during the 6-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.768" offset="7352466">So, my friend's argument is that, well, Congress said 6 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.403" offset="7363020">The answer to that point is a couple fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.922" offset="7373155">First, as was suggested in the first half-hour, Congress was addressing a very specific problem there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.076" offset="7393740">Before BAPCPA courts didn't know what the -- didn't agree on what the baseline was for determining someone's income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.980" offset="7417354">Some courts would say, all right, you are a Chapter 13 debtor, right away I'm going to look at the latest month.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.365" offset="7434909">Some courts said 6 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.748" offset="7440447">We have a court in our brief that said 4 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.650" offset="7447970">So, we have to have a starting point to project from.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.919" offset="7457061">But the second point is that this term 13 term at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.073" offset="7481720">So, my friend's argument is that Congress stuck this 6-month period into Chapter 13, so it would be very anomalous if we could just -- in effect, he says we are throwing it out, we are giving the district judges discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.278" offset="7518501">It's not quite right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.547" offset="7523621">The place to look is in section 707, which is two pages later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.915" offset="7541070">707 is a Chapter 7 provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.451" offset="7551206">And my friend started out by saying the problem with our position is that we were not following the Chapter 7 means test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.105" offset="7573880">That's the key.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.855" offset="7576806">This term is really a -- borrowed from Chapter 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.807" offset="7588613">So 707(b)(2)(A)(i) is at the beginning of page 85 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.044" offset="7609616">And, so, we are in a Chapter 7 case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.246" offset="7618393">And this is the means test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.179" offset="7622154">It tells us that: 1&gt; ["], so we are trying to figure out if there is a presumption of abuse under Chapter 7 --</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.817" offset="7644724">"whether the granting of relief would be an abuse of the provisions of this chapter, the court shall presume abuse exists if the debtor's current monthly income, reduced by the amounts determined under clauses 2, 3, and 4. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.355" offset="7690804">--those are expense clauses --</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.540" offset="7695611">"and multiplied by 60 is not less than. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.492" offset="7707418">a certain amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.359" offset="7710866">So what happened is Congress in BAPCPA created this presumption of abuse in Chapter 7 and it then borrowed that concept, as my friend pointed out, in Chapter 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.865" offset="7748901">So that 6-month period has real force and effect in the Bankruptcy Code in Chapter 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.502" offset="7771470">So it's not like Congress in Chapter 13 fixed the 6-month period, which would give -- have a sort of a gravitational pull.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.906" offset="7797070">You wouldn't want to throw that out too lightly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.792" offset="7804594">Justice Sotomayor, I do agree that we ought to be pretty -- we ought to stick to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.994" offset="7817446">It indicates Congress is concerned with the 6-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.428" offset="7827163">But it's not like Congress added to Chapter 13 this 6-month concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.880" offset="7844927">It added it to Chapter 7, where it's in full force and effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.201" offset="7858197">Can I make one other point about that language, just to repeat it again?</text>

            <text syncTime="2121.960" offset="8593283">As you pointed out, this is pre-BAPCPA practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.512" offset="8603418">Courts have set a pretty high bar, both in terms of the level of certainty and the degree of deviation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.315" offset="8622644">And courts have said -- I will give you an example that will illustrate the difference perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.017" offset="8637482">You have times when someone expects to get a raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.819" offset="8648662">They don't know that they are going to get it, or they expect to get a promotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.921" offset="8661096">And courts will say, even if that's pretty likely, until you have actually got it we are not going to count it for purposes of 1325(b); come back under 1329.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.777" offset="8696519">And we point out in our merits brief that in fact, it's not quite on point, but she got a settlement post-confirmation here, and under 1329 that money was applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.633" offset="8731941">So, Justice Scalia, there are post-confirmation events, but if you know ahead of time -- and this case is a perfect example, it -- we know she is not going to get another buyout from Payless Shoe Stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.905" offset="8773005">When it's known or virtually certain, we think that is sufficient -- akin to Justice Sotomayor's point about, you know, making it hard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.610" offset="8803830">Let me make one other point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.960" offset="8809263">I wanted to finish off my answer to the Chief Justice about 101.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.312" offset="8822638">This provision has taken on greater significance in the oral argument and the reply brief of the Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.533" offset="8843536">I did want to point out to the Court a provision that is not reproduced in the parties' briefs, but if the Court were to go this route it would want to be aware of, and that's 521(i).</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.806" offset="8876659">And 521(i) tells us that you do have to file the forms at the beginning or you have to file them within 45 days, but upon request of the debtor made within 45 days after the date of filing the petition, the court may allow the debtor an additional period of not to exceed 45 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.951" offset="8949175">So it does seem to constrain the power of the bankruptcy court to shift this period all around.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.985" offset="8969341">So, I have made two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.854" offset="8972790">One is it's a one-way ratchet for the debtor; second, it's not unlimited.</text>

            <text syncTime="2291.500" offset="9271421">My only point is that I have explained, I think, why Congress put the 6-month period in for purposes of Chapter 7 and also to have the starting point.</text>

            <text syncTime="2301.105" offset="9309874">If we were to define inflation as the amount in the rise in prices over the previous 6 months, if Congress did that in a statute and then told us to look at projected inflation, we would still not ignore things that will tell us that there are going to be -- there has been an oil price spike or an increase in health care costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.234" offset="9378314">It would take a pretty firm, firm period that told us to only look into the past and not look into the future, particularly when the whole point of the statute is to make sure that the money goes into the creditor's hands that the debtor is able to pay.</text>

            <text syncTime="2424.481" offset="9803379">Now, Congress certainly could have chosen to elevate simplicity over accuracy by telling bankruptcy courts to take a debtor's current disposable income and multiply that number by the number of months in the plan in assessing whether the plan is confirmable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.891" offset="9860953">But there are several strong signals in the code that that is actually not what Congress intended courts to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="2910.875" offset="11748874">So if a change occurs very soon before the filing of the petition, it makes it very hard for a court to use that provision to change the lookback period because you would have to wait 6 months, essentially, after the filing of the petition to set it back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.702" offset="11800179">But again, the biggest problem with using that section as a workaround is that that is an option that is available to debtors, but not to creditors.</text>

            <text syncTime="3078.451" offset="12419176">The certain expenses from 707(b) are not a wild card.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.320" offset="12434745">They are IRS standards in certain other specially defined circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.855" offset="12448852">The idea that this would allow a phantom car payment -- no, we don't think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.259" offset="12466406">There is language in that section that says that the expenses have to be applicable and actual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.561" offset="12487617">And one case recently decided in the Ninth Circuit, the Ransom case, says that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.615" offset="12503918">You have to look at the language in 707(b) in order to determine the propriety of the expenses, which has nothing to do with the applicability of the 6-month time frame.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.304" offset="12538608">What the government and what the Respondent choose to do here is to basically gut the entire means test based upon one word, and that's "projected".</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.843" offset="12580822">And they choose to use an undefined term "projected" over the statutory language that Congress chose to determine what debtors should pay to their creditors, and it's a congressional choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.384" offset="12622932">And as many commentators have suggested, if there is a remedy here, it is a congressional remedy and not a judicial remedy.</text>
