            <text syncTime="8.229" offset="138386">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The debtor in this case claimed, in the third column of Schedule C, a $10,718 exempt interest in her kitchen equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.330" offset="198781">That claim of exemption was fully proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.799" offset="216649">The trustee did not object to it because it was unobjectionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.579" offset="239741">The debtor's position here is that because of what she wrote in the fourth column, where she estimated the value of the equipment as the same amount of the exemption, that her claim of exemption itself should be read to say something different from and greater than what it actually says.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="56.758" offset="332424">Mr. Goldblatt, I thought that what she said -- I'm looking at Schedule C, property claimed as exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.614" offset="367846">She lists, as property claimed as exempt,</text>

            <text syncTime="74.658" offset="404104">And then we have an inventory going for several handwritten pages of all these items of kitchen equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.917" offset="445064">And that's what she says is the property claimed as exempt.</text>

            <text syncTime="92.383" offset="474948">With respect, Justice Ginsburg, that's incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.879" offset="484979">If you turn to her Schedule C, which is in the joint appendix at pages 57 and 58a, the first column is a description of the property, and the third column contains the value of the claimed exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.704" offset="548195">The property claimed as exempt here is the $10,718 interest in the asset listed in column A.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.384" offset="590932">And the reason that's clear, Your Honor, it's clear from the language of the statute itself because the statutory language of 522(l) provides that the debtor files a list of property that the debtor claims as exempt and that, unless a party in interest objects, the property claimed as exempt is exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.314" offset="682674">522(l) refers to the property claimed as exempt under subsection (b), and subsection (b) in turn references subsection (d), which is the basis for the claim of exemption here.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.778" offset="732515">And 522(d), when it describes the exemption, says the following:</text>
            <text syncTime="163.070" offset="757697">"The following property may be exempted: One, the debtor's aggregate interest, not to exceed $18,450 in property. "</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="177.534" offset="815585">But she -- in her inventory, she gives figures, and they add up to the amount that she's claiming, so she evidently thinks that those numbers will cover all of her business equipment.</text>

            <text syncTime="199.512" offset="903461">She may -- the debtor here may well have believed that the value of the equipment here was equal to the amount of the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.540" offset="935539">But no one contends in any serious way that the trustee is required to object to the debtor's valuation of the equipment.</text>

            <text syncTime="222.156" offset="994053">It seems what she wants is her cooking equipment, not the money equivalent.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.750" offset="1020385">And if the trustee had objected, she could have said: Well, if they think that this cooking equipment is worth more than the value that I put down, I'll cut out the coffee maker, I'll cut out the microwave; but what I want is the equipment, not the dollar -- dollars for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="255.021" offset="1125501">The question here is, did she make a claim on her schedule that the equipment was itself exempt in kind?</text>
            <text syncTime="263.877" offset="1160923">There are a number of ways that debtors can do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.453" offset="1175239">They can write,</text>
            <text syncTime="268.014" offset="1177433">"I claim an exemption in the full amount. "</text>
            <text syncTime="269.719" offset="1184329">Here, take -- take a debtor who is saying: Look, all I want is the exemption that Congress gives me.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.243" offset="1218393">I understand that all I'm entitled to here is a $10,718 interest in my equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.068" offset="1241694">I think my equipment is worth that.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.646" offset="1252039">If it turns out that I'm wrong and it's worth more, I don't want any more than the Bankruptcy Code gives me.</text>

            <text syncTime="1224.238" offset="5002386">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The government is not saying that it's a coincidence that these numbers in the third and fourth columns are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.607" offset="5051810">It is a common practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.358" offset="5058811">A debtor will often estimate what she believes to be the market value of her property and then divvy up a wild card across items in hope -- hopes of keeping them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.683" offset="5092143">The government's and Petitioner's only point is that where a debtor does that, as Respondent did here, she's still claiming the fixed exemption of what she believes to be the market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.788" offset="5128610">Now, I take your concern, Justice Ginsburg, this might be unfair to debtors who wouldn't be tipped off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.410" offset="5147105">That is not true here, where the trustee came to the creditors' meeting and said: I construe your exemption as limited, and I think the property is worth about $7,000 more, and I intend to sell it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.435" offset="5195170">And at that point, a debtor who really believed that her schedule claimed full value would, it seems to me, have said: You're misreading my schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.618" offset="5231846">She didn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.434" offset="5235190">She didn't do that until after the 30-day period had run when the trustee moved to sell the property.</text>

            <text syncTime="1313.450" offset="5359219">Which she doesn't have a right to do under Chapter 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.513" offset="5367474">She has to show cause under section 707(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.449" offset="5379176">The Bankruptcy Court found that she had not shown cause, and the debtor didn't appeal that determination, which is not before this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1333.927" offset="5441139">And on remand, it would certainly be open to her to attempt to convince the Bankruptcy Court again that she had shown cause under 707 to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.673" offset="5468097">I think the government's point is that there is a process for sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.409" offset="5483039">So even beyond the facts of this case, when the trustee wants to sell property, he has to give 20 days' notice to the debtors and the creditors under section 363 of the code and Rule 2002.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.573" offset="5527761">So if the trustee here had not even said anything at the creditors' meeting but had moved to sell, he would have had to give notice to the debtor, who at that point could always amend her schedules under Rule 1009.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.992" offset="5569348">If she had any exemption left to claim, she could walk in and say: I'm going to amend my schedule, and I'm going to increase my exemption, because I underestimated the property value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.940" offset="5609159">The reason she didn't and couldn't do that here is because she had maxed out her wild card.</text>

            <text syncTime="3488.130" offset="14057890">The trustee cannot sell property, unless it is property of the estate, and under section 522, if, in fact, the debtor claims property as exempt, if there is no exemption -- no objection, it is exempt, and, therefore, it's not property of the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.544" offset="14119643">"Exempt" means exempt from property of the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.840" offset="14132809">A trustee cannot sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.622" offset="14139914">Congress set up this regime purposefully, to have judicial determinations of exemptions right away, and that, again, is triggered by an objection being filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.398" offset="14178994">That way, we know, at the beginning of the case, does the debtor have the property?</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.426" offset="14195085">Can she use it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.772" offset="14200519">Can she continue?</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.817" offset="14204698">Third parties -- can they rely on that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.583" offset="14211803">Or is this something the trustee is going to be able to sell?</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.784" offset="14224551">Now, it's important also because the practice, in bankruptcy, as reflected in the Collier forms, is that the bankruptcy court can make a judicial determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.031" offset="14257570">Say, for example, the bankruptcy court here had said: I think there is some merit to the trustee's objection; the property is worth $12,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.527" offset="14287559">The practice, as reflected in the sample form, is for the court then to say to the debtor: Debtor, if you want to keep this property, give the trustee a check for the difference between what you're entitled to claim and what I'm establishing the value to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.474" offset="14339281">That can happen if an objection to the exemption is filed, and we're under section 522 exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.319" offset="14362687">That can't happen if we're under section 362 sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.786" offset="14376584">So, again, the trustee's rule eliminates that established practice and that established option in favor of the debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.048" offset="14401661">Also, the debtor could say -- could reallocate -- the debtor has the right, under the rules, under Rule 1009, to reallocate her -- her exemptions after the trustee has -- she could have sacrificed some other area or something and taken -- taken her additional exemption availability somewhere and applied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.727" offset="14476372">All those options are foreclosed, where the trustee doesn't file an objection and the trustee moves to sell instead.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.007" offset="14505420">Now -- I see my time has not expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.067" offset="14529661">If there are no further questions?</text>

            <label>Mr. Craig G Goldblatt</label>
            <text syncTime="3611.327" offset="14550768">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.155" offset="14562053">I have two points, one practical and one about what the forms here mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.387" offset="14586922">First, as a practical matter, the task of liquidating and selling the -- the assets of the estates is the work that is done throughout bankruptcy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.242" offset="14630390">Mr. Brunstad's suggestion that, historically, that there was -- the deadline applied to the work of liquidating the estate is simply incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.566" offset="14675634">And, in response to Justice Breyer's question, you asked, where do I turn to find out how hard it is to simply extend the deadline?</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.858" offset="14704891">The answer to that question, with respect to the 341 meeting, is page 7-7 of the U.S. Trustees' Manual, which says, quite clearly, that such extensions should be granted only under exceptional circumstances, and the trustee should not continue the 341 meeting when the debtor appears at that meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.506" offset="14787438">So that we have a real practical problem of basically undermining Congress's judgment about giving the trustee adequate time to liquidate the assets for the benefit of creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.220" offset="14826308">With respect to what these schedules mean and whether the debtor was claiming an in-kind exemption, Chief Justice Roberts, you had it right when you said -- you know, when the debtor files what the value of the property is worth is unclear, the debtor doesn't know, when they file, what this will obtain at auction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.653" offset="14900078">The debtor is giving an estimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.322" offset="14906661">The question is whether one should read these forms to say, if it turns out that my estimate is wrong, I want that anyway, or if the -- or if you should read these forms to say, if it turns out that my estimate is wrong, all I want is what Congress gave me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.455" offset="14967265">And we think that one shouldn't lightly impute to the debtor a claim to be making an improper and unlawful claim to keep the thing itself, when Congress quite clearly gave the debtor a monetary interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.077" offset="15021704">And, finally, with respect to the question of allocation, the debtor can, at any time, Justice Ginsburg, reallocate, including after the motion to sell, their schedules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.042" offset="15065590">Rule 1009 says you can amend as a matter of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.790" offset="15080532">So there is still the opportunity to give the debtor exactly what Congress intended.</text>
