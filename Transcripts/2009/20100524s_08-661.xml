            <text syncTime="35.583" offset="247787">For almost 40 years NFLP granted non-exclusive licenses to a number of different vendors, one of which was the petitioner in this case American Needle.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.958" offset="297211">In 2000 however the teams authorized a NFLP to grant exclusive licenses which it did, because they declined to renew petitioner's license it brought this action against the teams and NFLP seeking treble damages under the Sherman Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="85.003" offset="445482">We granted certiorari and now reverse.</text>
