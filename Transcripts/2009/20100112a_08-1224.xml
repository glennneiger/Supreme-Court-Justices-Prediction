            <text syncTime="8.025" offset="136526">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Article I of the Constitution permits Congress to enact section 4248, which is the limited Federal civil commitment statute at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.097" offset="188771">To see why, to understand the basis for this statute, it might be helpful to go all the way back to 1945, when what this Court later called</text>

            <text syncTime="33.575" offset="238717">recommended that Congress pass section 4246, a very similar civil commitment law that has been on the books for some 60 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.616" offset="278841">The committee there wrote that the law was necessary to deal with what it called the serious problem of what to do with insane criminals -- and I'm quoting now --</text>

            <text syncTime="64.485" offset="362329">That is exactly what Congress concluded here.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.779" offset="379465">Congress could reasonably find that section 4248 was necessary to prevent a similar problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.995" offset="412379">The Federal Government has mentally ill, sexually dangerous persons in its custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.633" offset="438920">It knows that those persons, if released, will commit serious sexual offenses; and it knows too that States are often not in a position to deal with such dangers, not in a position to take custody and care and responsibility for those persons upon release from Federal prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.640" offset="530975">This is essentially a transitional problem that the Court was -- that the Congress was dealing with, how to manage the transition from Federal custody to State superintendence and responsibility.</text>

            <text syncTime="205.687" offset="927096">But the Federal statute commits the Attorney General and the Bureau of Prisons to try to persuade a State to take custody, to defer to the State if a State has some reason to take custody, but -- but makes sure that the Federal Government is a kind of backstop, so that if the State does not take responsibility and does not take custody, the Federal Government will ensure that the person will not be released, the person who has been found to be both mentally ill and sexually--</text>

            <text syncTime="1341.725" offset="5471253">The Commerce Clause I think is relevant in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.256" offset="5481388">It's relevant first because, of course, it's often the Commerce Clause that gives rise to the power to criminalize conduct and to punish people for that conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="1363.094" offset="5556726">The Commerce Clause is also relevant here because the Commerce Clause does give rise to a set of Federal laws having to do with sexual offenses, sexual solicitation of a minor, sexual exploitation of a minor when interstate commerce is involved, and when the Internet is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.681" offset="5627152">And we do think that that provides an additional basis, not a sufficient basis, but an additional basis to -- to approve this law in the sense that these are the people who are most likely, really, to violate such Federal laws which are based on the Commerce Clause in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.371" offset="5709908">And the reason they are most likely is because all of them have done it once before, and all of them have been found to have the kind of mental illness that makes it--</text>

            <text syncTime="3433.555" offset="14208481">What Congress said here was something pretty simple and very reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.271" offset="14208376">It said if we, the Federal Government, have somebody in our custody, and we know that that person has the kind of mental illness that's going to cause grave danger to the community, and we know that there is no one else who is in a good position to prevent it, and we know that we are in part responsible for that vacuum, then we should be able to do something about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.515" offset="14208272">That's what section 4248 says, and section 4248 is constitutional for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.964" offset="14208167">Justice Scalia has several times suggested that maybe there is no experience of this, but I think that the facts of the Judicial Conference Committee report, stating that there were these problems with respect to mentally ill people generally, rebuts that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.535" offset="14208063">So, too, this Court's view in Shannon, that section 4243 was necessary because there was a gaping statutory hole where States were not willing to step forward, rebuts that as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.655" offset="14207958">In fact, it is not and has never been the case that the test here is whether a government action is absolutely necessary to aid or effect a governmental or congressional power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.508" offset="14207854">The wisdom of the statute here is not what's at issue: Maybe this is the right statute; maybe there might be a better one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.303" offset="14207749">The only question is the constitutionality of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.253" offset="14207645">That sort of wisdom, whether there might be a better statute, that's for Congress to decide.</text>
