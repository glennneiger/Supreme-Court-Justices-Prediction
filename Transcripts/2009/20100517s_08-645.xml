            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">Justice Kennedy has the opinion of the court this morning in three cases.</text>

          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="5.202" stopTime="444.865">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="5.202" offset="127289">The first case is 08-645, Abbott versus Abbott.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.095" offset="146829">Mr. and Mrs. Abbott moved to Chile with their young son.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.932" offset="162189">Now, there was marital discord.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.238" offset="171384">The couple separated.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.014" offset="178489">The Chilean courts granted the mother daily care and control over the boy while awarding the father regular visitation rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.074" offset="210777">The Chilean law also conferred upon the father ne exeat right.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.539" offset="228645">Now, a ne exeat right allows a parent, and here it was father, to consent before the other parent can take the child out of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.779" offset="261559">This right was of no avail however, the mother took the boy out of Chile without the father's consent and this abduction violated the father’s ne exeat right.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.107" offset="298862">Both parents, both parties agree on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.657" offset="313072">The father found Ms. Abbott and the boy in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.029" offset="326552">The father brought this suit in United States District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.758" offset="337523">He sought an order requiring his son’s return to Chile under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects Of International Child Abduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.006" offset="378483">Now that convention is a treaty to which the United States is a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.599" offset="396873">Congress has implemented it by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.649" offset="408994">The District Court denied the father's requested remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.505" offset="420488">The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.167" offset="435116">Both parties agree too that the convention applies to this dispute, and that's because the boy is under 16 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.571" offset="464687">He was a habitual resident of Chile and both Chile and United States are contracting parties to the convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.639" offset="493004">The disagreement concerns how to interpret a key provision in the convention and that phrase is Rights of Custody and the question becomes whether or not the ne exeat right is also a right of custody under the convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.666" offset="553085">If the ne exeat right that the father has is a right of custody then the father may assert a return remedy in the United States Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.292" offset="587567">On this theory the Trial Court would have to issue an order directing that the child be returned to Chile unless certain exceptions apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.969" offset="618287">This Court's inquiry is shaped by the text of the convention, the views of the United States Department of State, decisions addressing the meaning of Rights of Custody and courts of other contracting states and the purposes of the convention and after considering these sources the Court determines that the father’s ne exeat right is a right of custody under the convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.527" offset="704596">The convention defines Rights of Custody to include rights relating to the care of the person of the child and in particular the right to determine the child's place of residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.616" offset="748899">A parent holding an ne exeat right has both the right to determine a child's place of residence and rights relating to the care and person of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.955" offset="790277">The phrase Place of Residence, does encompass the child's country of residence and this is especially so in light of the convention's purpose to prevent wrongful removal across international borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.327" offset="847747">Here the ne exeat right gives the farther a joint right to determine his son's country of residence as the boy cannot live in any country other than Chile with the father's consent -- without the father's consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.130" offset="902917">The father’s ne exeat right also give him rights relating to the care of the person of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.255" offset="923502">Few decisions are as significant, as the language the child speaks, the identity he finds or the culture and traditions she will come to absorb.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.086" offset="962790">These factors are linked in an inextricable way to the child's country of residence, one need only consider the different childhoods a child would experience if he or she grew up in the United States, Chile, Germany or North Korea to understand how taking joint part in choosing the child's country of residence is a right related to the care of the person of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.823" offset="1069787">The Court of Appeals' conclusion that the breach of ne exeat right does not give rise to return remedy would render the convention meaningless in many cases where it is most needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.388" offset="1108031">The convention provides a return remedy, when a parent takes a child across international borders in violation of a Right of Custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.842" offset="1141781">The conclusion, the Court reaches in today's case is supported and informed by the State Department's view that ne exeat rights are rights of custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.949" offset="1174277">The executive is well informed, concerning the diplomatic consequences of this Court's interpretation of the convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.282" offset="1203534">This includes the likely reaction of other contracting states and the impact on the State Department's ability to reclaim children who are abducted from this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.537" offset="1244599">The conclusion that ne exeat right are rights of custody is further informed by the views of other contracting states.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.739" offset="1269363">As is explained in today's opinion, the Court has consulted cases interpreting the convention in the High Courts of the United Kingdom, Israel, Austria, South Africa and Germany and the opinion discusses those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.105" offset="1326832">They all agree that ne exeat rights are rights of custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.552" offset="1344700">It is true on the other hand that the Canadian Supreme Court has indicated a contrary view in dicta and the French Courts are divided, yet even in light of this division, the Court and scholars in this area agree that there is an emerging international consensus that ne exeat right are rights of custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.390" offset="1427978">The view that the convention provides a return remedy for violation of ne exeat right, accords with the convention's objects and purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.688" offset="1457236">Ordering a return remedy does not alter the allocation of custody rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.969" offset="1474372">It does allow the courts of the home country to decide what is in the child's best interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.479" offset="1504360">Custody decisions are often difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.823" offset="1517735">Judges must always strive to avoid a common tendency to prefer their own society and culture, a tendency that ought not to interfere with objective consideration of all the factors that should be weighed in determining the best interest of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.338" offset="1583773">International law serves a high purpose when it underwrites the determination by nations to rely upon their domestic courts to enforce just laws by legitimate and fair proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.385" offset="1631943">To interpret the convention to permit an abducting parent to avoid a return remedy even when the other parent holds ne exeat right would run counter to the convention's purpose of deterring child abductions by parents who attempt to find a friendlier forum for deciding custodial disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.519" offset="1712504">This Court should be most reluctant to adopt an interpretation that gives an abducting parent an advantage by coming here to avoid a return remedy that is granted for instance in the United Kingdom, Israel, Austria, Germany and South Africa.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.905" offset="1770078">Requiring a return remedy in cases like this one does helps deter child abductions and abduction can have devastating consequences for the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.838" offset="1809784">Child psychologists believe that the trauma children suffer from an abduction is one of the worst forms of child abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.420" offset="1844161">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings, Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Thomas and Breyer joined.</text>
