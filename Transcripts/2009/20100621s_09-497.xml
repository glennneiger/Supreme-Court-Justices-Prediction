            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">Justice Scalia has our opinion this morning in case 09-497, the Rent-A-Center West versus Jackson.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="7.769" stopTime="396.461">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="7.769" offset="135481">This case is here on writ of certiorari to United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.779" offset="159514">In 2007, respondent Antonio Jackson filed an employment discrimination suit in federal court against his former employer, petitioner, Rent-A-Center West Incorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.874" offset="211864">Rent-A-Center filed a motion under the Federal Arbitration Act to dismiss or stay the proceedings and to compel arbitration, based on the mutual agreement to arbitrate which Jackson had signed as a condition of his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.609" offset="278841">That agreement provided for arbitration of all past, present or future disputes arising out of Jackson's employment with Rent-A-Center.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.019" offset="316458">The agreement also provided in a separate provision that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve disputes about the enforceability of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.956" offset="364210">Jackson resisted arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.232" offset="373300">He claimed that the agreement was unenforceable because it was unconscionable under Nevada law.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.744" offset="403393">Rent-A-center replied that the agreement assigned resolution of the question of unconscionability which is a question of enforceability to the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.001" offset="440383">The district court granted Rent-A-Center's motion and the Ninth Circuit reversed in relevant part.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.240" offset="461385">We granted certiorari and now reverse the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.648" offset="478939">The FAA, Federal Arbitration Act reflects the fundamental principle that arbitration is a matter of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.003" offset="508406">Section 2 of the Act provides that “a written provision in a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settled by arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.314" offset="549679">A controversy thereafter arising out of such contract shall be valid, irrevocable and unenforceable save upon such grounds as exists at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.”</text>
            <text syncTime="125.913" offset="608089">Courts must enforce arbitration agreements according to their terms, in another words, except that arbitration agreements like other contracts may be invalidated by generally applicable contract defenses such as fraud, duress or unconscionability.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.573" offset="670678">As I mentioned earlier the arbitration agreement at issue here includes two relevant written provisions to in the words of Section 2 settled by arbitration, a controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.795" offset="719579">The first is the provision stating that disputes relating to Jackson's employment are subject to arbitration and the second is the provision stating that disputes regarding the enforceability of the arbitration agreement itself are subject to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.627" offset="786871">The current controversy between the parties whether the agreement is unenforceable because it is unconscionable, is governed by the second provision and it is that provision which Rent-A-Center asks us to enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.319" offset="841624">I will call it the delegation provision because it delegates resolution of the enforceability controversy to the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.428" offset="886136">Enforceability is a so-called gateway question, like the question of whether the agreement was ever in fact entered into, it has to be answered before applying the arbitration agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.737" offset="935351">Our cases have imposed a special requirement upon agreements to arbitrate gateway issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.563" offset="966698">Before those gateway issues can be taken away from the courts, there must be “clear and unmistakable evidence” that the parties agreed to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.459" offset="1014241">The delegation provision here satisfies that heighten requirement because as both the district court and the Ninth Circuit found, its text clearly and unmistakably provides that the arbitrator will decide questions of enforceability and once that heightened requirement is satisfied, the FAA operates on that additional arbitration agreement just as it does on any other.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.484" offset="1114342">It is important for purposes of this case to distinguish between two types of validity challenges under Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.831" offset="1143704">One type challenge is specifically the validity of the agreement to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.965" offset="1164288">The other challenge is the whole contract of which the agreement to arbitrate is merely a part.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.214" offset="1189261">In the line of cases beginning with the case called Prima Paint Corporation versus Flood &amp; Conklin Manufacturing Company, we held that only the first type of challenge, namely a challenge specifically to the validity of the agreement to arbitrate, can invalidate an agreement to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.328" offset="1261672">That is to say an arbitration provision is severable from the remainder of the contract and stands on its own feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.761" offset="1291452">This case differs from the Prima Paint line of cases because the arbitration provisions sought to be enforced in those cases were contained in contracts unrelated to arbitration, employment contracts for example that had an arbitration provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.492" offset="1362401">Whereas in this case, the delegation clause is part of an agreement that is itself entirely an arbitration agreement, but that makes no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.008" offset="1408376">Application of the severability rule does not depend on the substance of the remainder of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.554" offset="1434603">Section 2 operates on the written provision to “settle by arbitration a controversy" that the party seeks to enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.914" offset="1468040">Thus unless Jackson challenged the delegation provision specifically, we must treat it as valid under Section 2 and enforce --sending the question of enforceability to the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.479" offset="1526345">The district court correctly concluded that Jackson challenged only the validity of the contract as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.926" offset="1552050">His filings before the district court and the Ninth Circuit confirmed this.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.870" offset="1567828">He argued that the entire agreement and the arbitration agreement as a whole were unconscionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.168" offset="1593114">He repeated those arguments in this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.004" offset="1604399">In addition, for first time in his brief to this Court, he claimed that the delegation provision specifically was unconscionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.044" offset="1636582">He raised that challenge too late and we will not consider it.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.708" offset="1651210">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.010" offset="1660406">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Ginsburg, Breyer and Sotomayor have joined.</text>
