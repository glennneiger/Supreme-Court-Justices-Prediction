            <label>Mr. Donald B. Ayer</label>
            <text syncTime="7.004" offset="134499">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When counsel for the United States defended the McNally prosecution before this Court in 1987, the first thing he did was to acknowledge that many of the existing intangible rights cases contained what he called "extravagant" language that, on its face, extended the doctrine far beyond the principle that one can be guilty of fraudulently denying others the performance of a clear legal duty that he owes.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.304" offset="239616">I know that because the government lawyer was me--</text>
            <text syncTime="37.089" offset="254767">[Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="37.806" offset="257693">And that was the only thing I said that day that the 7-2 majority agreed with.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.260" offset="279531">But 22 years later, and one 28-word statute later, the United States is now pressing to take that extravagant language of the pre-McNally cases to the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.801" offset="325611">It does that by contending that a public official commits honest services fraud simply by failing to disclose an arguable conflict of interest, even though he has no legal duty to disclose apart from the words of 1346.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.327" offset="383707">And it -- and it is possible to do that under the extravagant words of the earlier cases by relying on a supposed Federal common law fiduciary duty of loyalty that is owed by all public officials, including State officials, to their constituents.</text>

            <text syncTime="89.224" offset="463329">So if the -- there were a State law that said you must disclose anything that could reasonably be viewed as a conflict of interest, then -- then you would lose?</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald B. Ayer</label>
            <text syncTime="99.930" offset="506169">Your Honor, you are now asking me the question about the outer perimeter of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.650" offset="525082">My argument is that a duty -- some duty clear in the law is absolutely necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.637" offset="549010">What kind of a duty would be sufficient is a much more difficult question, and it's a difficult question for -- for, essentially, two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.077" offset="578790">One is, the duty must be clear and not vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.712" offset="593314">That's one point.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.829" offset="597807">The more complex point is a point relating to this Court's clear statement rule and related concepts concerning particular duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.885" offset="629990">If a State creates a system of contractual duties, those duties have certain consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.503" offset="652455">Generally speaking, contractual duties have a consequence of paying damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.341" offset="667815">People conduct themselves in certain ways in a contractual system.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.625" offset="684952">They don't expect to go to jail, usually, for breaching a contractual duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.010" offset="702506">Similarly--</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="149.493" offset="704387">I mean, the mail fraud statute carries a very heavy penalty, and are you -- you are arguing that Congress intended to impose this penalty on individuals who breach some Federal or State disclosure requirement, even if that is viewed by the body that is responsible for the disclosure requirement as a very minor thing.</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="175.578" offset="808772">--Oh, I'm -- I'm -- Your Honor, if I left that impression, let me completely reject it.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.713" offset="825281">That is not at all what I'm arguing.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.213" offset="831342">To the contrary, I am arguing that -- that ultimately, the task this Court may decide it must pursue -- which, I think, frankly, is quite separate from our case, because our case is a case where there is no duty, period, in the law, which I want to explain procedurally why that's true -- if you are going to decide that some duties are enough and other duties are not, it is a very challenging thing to do, and a very--</text>

            <text syncTime="207.363" offset="935936">I understand you are saying that -- that there cannot be a conviction without the violation of some duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.351" offset="959864">But if we agree with that, then we are going down the road of deciding what sort of duty suffices, and does it have to be a duty that is backed up by a State criminal sanction?</text>
            <text syncTime="223.225" offset="999361">What if -- what if it's a 1-year felony?</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald B. Ayer</label>
            <text syncTime="235.199" offset="1047218">Well, Your Honor, I -- let me -- I want to repeat again that -- that in -- in my view, our case doesn't turn on my ability to satisfactorily draw this line which no court has driven -- drawn effectively in 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.174" offset="1095178">But I would -- I would say this: There are two approaches that have been suggested that -- that have fewer problems than others.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.613" offset="1128929">And one -- if you begin with the question of duty and say, what duties will suffice -- and I'm not -- I'm not endorsing this; I'm simply saying it -- it pares the covered duties back significantly to a point where this Court might find it preferable to some other approaches -- would be the one Your Honor mentioned, criminal law duties, duties as to which the conduct breached already is criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.895" offset="1222029">There's a subsidiary question, I think: Whether, in fact, you might want to require felony duties, because there are different penalties with regard to different duties.</text>

          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="288.434" stopTime="324.904">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="288.434" offset="1260168">The real problem with your approach, which I take it is you have to find these duties in State law, is that some States will classify the same conduct as a felony that another will classify as a misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.761" offset="1321503">So that line won't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.629" offset="1328922">And then some States will make something criminal that other States won't.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.330" offset="1347730">So you're going to have, depending on geography, people potentially subject to a 20-year term because of the particularities of -- of a -- the State law.</text>

            <text syncTime="327.290" offset="1415649">And I am not -- I am not here to endorse that as a satisfactory alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.494" offset="1432472">I'm simply saying it's preferable to some of the others.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald B. Ayer</label>
            <text syncTime="338.564" offset="1460684">No, Your Honor, I'm not.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.100" offset="1466849">I'm asking the Court -- and that's a confusion in the question presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.950" offset="1478238">This is a case in which the government very clearly, and the trial court found, made no attempt to produce anything other than 1346 as the source of any Federal disclosure duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.275" offset="1527557">There was no Federal disclosure duty that they could point to specifically dealing with disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.227" offset="1547306">The court -- the trial court ended up focusing -- in fact, I'd like, if I could, to take a couple of minutes on the procedure to establish sort of the posture of this case, because I think it may otherwise be confusing.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.285" offset="1591609">Essentially, what we had here was an indictment that, when filed, in the vaguest of terms, it alleged as the purpose -- and this is at joint appendix page 35 -- the purpose of the scheme was for Company A to agree to provide things of value to the Petitioner to cause Petitioner to misuse his official authority for the benefit of Company A.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.733" offset="1681366">A traditional, simple allegation of -- of bribery.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.285" offset="1699547">And there has never been a question in this case that if the government thinks it can prove that case, they are welcome to try.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.920" offset="1722117">And -- and they can do that, and in the course of doing that, they have -- it's certainly open to them to show that the defendant didn't specifically stand up and make an announcement that he had submitted a job solicitation to Company A, as he had submitted solicitations to a half a dozen other employers, as is perfectly legal under Alaska law.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.982" offset="1802365">So all of that is fair game.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.766" offset="1809471">But a few days before trial, what ended up happening here -- and this is where this case comes from.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.987" offset="1830369">A few days before trial, first in a trial brief and thereafter in a motion in limine dealing with submission of evidence, the government announced that it wanted to -- to pursue what it called -- what the trial court called its alternative theory; frankly, we think, because they couldn't prove their bribery case.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.449" offset="1900272">And what they said their theory was, was that when a public official -- this is in the trial brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.186" offset="1923156">There's an almost exact quote, similar, at J.A. 42 in the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.138" offset="1943009">"When a public official fails to disclose the existence of a conflict of interest, whether required by law to do so or whether required by fiduciary duty to do so, the public official can be found guilty of honest services fraud, irrespective of whether the public official took any action thereafter, much less a fraudulent or harmful act. "</text>
            <text syncTime="481.003" offset="2030467">In other words, Mr. Weyhrauch -- Mr. Weyhrauch sent a solicitation letter, and that's about the size of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.840" offset="2061814">He sent a solicitation letter to a number of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.959" offset="2070277">He is a part-time legislator in a State that has a citizen legislature that has made a decision specifically not to have its -- its disclosure rules be unduly burdensome.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.517" offset="2116462">That's their own specific language: They don't want them to be unduly burdensome.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.969" offset="2130359">They have required certain disclosures.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.903" offset="2138091">They have not required others.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.370" offset="2143943">The trial court here looked at the government's motion, which was to put in evidence about Alaska ethics rules in support of this alternative theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.576" offset="2184798">And, indeed, the court said -- and the court of appeals, at 3a of the -- of the Pet. App. said that the evidence was exclusively to pursue this alternative theory that all you needed to do was fail to disclose in breach of a fiduciary duty, and, bingo, if you go on doing your job, you have committed honest services fraud.</text>

            <text syncTime="1382.613" offset="5636932">But -- but when the inherent nature of the statute, like this one, which says -- we're talking about public officials; mostly we're talking about State officials; we're talking about rights, and therefore, we're talking about duties -- most of the legal duties -- if you are going to be requiring legal duties, most of the legal duties that a State official owes are State law duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.293" offset="5727629">He owes them on account of his role in the State government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1420.636" offset="5788965">And so the notion that you -- you know, there's the De Sylva case from 1956, there's the Kamen case, the Brosnan case -- these are all cases where the Court has recognized a sensitivity about there are times when it makes sense to look to, or at least consider as one of the elements, State law norms.</text>

            <text syncTime="2986.084" offset="12050829">And if the Justice Department can't figure out what -- what is embraced by this statute, I don't know how you can expect the average citizen to figure it out.</text>

            <text syncTime="2993.671" offset="12081131">--Well, this body of law evolved post-McNally, without this Court's intervention and guidance to provide clarification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.761" offset="12109448">I think that the core understanding of what honest services is may have been strayed from in some of those cases, and some courts of appeals affirmed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.901" offset="12158036">That doesn't mean that the statute is vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.101" offset="12166813">This Court accepted review in Cleveland v. United States because the courts of appeals were divided on whether defrauding a government agency of a license constituted a deprivation of money or property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.792" offset="12209654">The U.S. attorneys on one side of the split were very aggressively pushing that theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.696" offset="12233268">This Court held that it wasn't a valid interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.582" offset="12244762">I think that it's the role of this Court and the -- within the proper disposition of this Court's authority to attempt to figure out what Congress did, and then to implement it in accordance with doctrines that are standard tools of the trade here -- rule of lenity, concerns about federalism -- and recognize that there is a core that Congress was looking at in the pre -- McNally cases, and that that core can be implemented consistent with concerns about notice and clarity of definition, without either creating a statute that is totally freeform or without invalidating Congress's effort to respond to the Court's invitation in McNally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.023" offset="12402542">And, if I could turn to the question presented in this case, which is whether State law duties need to be violated, State law disclosure obligations need to be violated in order to sustain a valid mail fraud prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.014" offset="12458548">The pre-McNally cases and McNally itself answers that because, in the McNally decision, this Court acknowledged that the government's theory of prosecution was that McNally and his cohorts were accepting kickbacks in the form of commissions on insurance contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.475" offset="12528347">And the courts recognized that the government's theory was they failed to disclose their interest to persons in State government who were in a position to take action with respect to that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.283" offset="12575577">And the Court specifically said: We should assume that there was no violation of any State law obligations in holding those interests or no violation of any State law duty to disclose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.158" offset="12623120">That was the theory of prosecution that the Court recognized the government was pursuing, and it was entirely consistent with the pre-McNally cases, Mandel and Margiotta, which were repeatedly cited in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.417" offset="12676096">And I won't take the Court's time to read language -- we've cited it in our brief -- where those cases clearly said no State law duty was required to be breached in order to state a prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.039" offset="12718623">There is still protection in this statute against prosecutions of citizens without notice because, as I said earlier, the government has to prove a violation of the duty to disclose by the officials taking action to further his undisclosed personal interest, and the citizen cannot be prosecuted and convicted without the government being able to show that he knew that he was violating a duty to disclose.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald B. Ayer</label>
            <text syncTime="3458.009" offset="13938437">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.925" offset="13942094">I have four quick points I'd like to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.675" offset="13949095">The first one is that McNally is a case -- there were issues about the jury instructions, but the basic fact pattern was clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.114" offset="13974904">It was a kickback scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.664" offset="13981069">It was illegal under the Kentucky constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.999" offset="13990473">There's no question that if it were charged properly, it could be convicted, and that's clear I think at page 11 of our yellow brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.403" offset="14016073">The second point I want to make is that this talk about whether or not Petitioner violated the statute about voting when he was in negotiations -- number one, the first answer to that is the government is perfectly free to prove that case if they want to; that's not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.829" offset="14077722">That's -- that's a different theory that they can pursue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.448" offset="14088276">It's not the disclosure theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.715" offset="14093291">But just by the way, he didn't violate it, and the reason he didn't violate it, particularly in light of what Mr. Dreeben has said -- first of all we don't think he was in negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.922" offset="14134147">He sent a letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.688" offset="14137177">There was never an offer either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.038" offset="14142610">There weren't negotiations, and that's been something that has been talked about in the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.390" offset="14155985">Secondly, he voted; when he voted he actually ended up voting twice on the bill in a form that -- that VECO didn't want.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.596" offset="14188795">So he actually -- and I learned today -- and this is all, you know, shifting sands -- that he has to have voted for the -- the way that the conflicting interest would have had him vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.452" offset="14224217">So there's not, I think, a problem there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.368" offset="14231949">If they want to pursue that, go to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.254" offset="14239472">They have every right to.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="3534.187" offset="14243234">You're saying that you'll win on the facts, not the theory.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald B. Ayer</label>
            <text syncTime="3536.622" offset="14252952">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.022" offset="14254519">Yes, and they have the right--</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="3537.956" offset="14258280">But that's not what we have to decide.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="donald_b_ayer" startTime="3538.206" stopTime="3647.308">
            <label>Mr. Donald B. Ayer</label>
            <text syncTime="3538.206" offset="14259221">--to pursue it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.456" offset="14260266">And -- and the third point I want to make is -- is that there is absolutely no doubt about this question with regard to what -- what the issue was in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.764" offset="14305510">And I would simply direct a few references to the -- and I'll read them very quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.066" offset="14322751">But 23a -- these are all the district court opinion: 23a, the district court says he is dealing with the more general proposition -- the government's more general proposition -- that honest services fraud may be proved by showing a violation of the duty to disclose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.641" offset="14376981">Then on 29a, the district court says</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.427" offset="14388161">"the proposition advanced by the United States, that honest services may be proved by establishing that a public official knowingly concealed a conflict of interest. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.181" offset="14419195">period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.897" offset="14422016">Then, on 36a, at the end the court says, you can bring any other theory you want other than the nondisclosure theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.770" offset="14449497">Now, did the government object?</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.703" offset="14457229">Did the government at any time say, oh, no, that's not our theory?</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.822" offset="14469768">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.422" offset="14472171">They didn't; they adopted that, and that's the theory they argued on appeal in the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.126" offset="14490979">And that's exactly the theory that the Ninth Circuit talked about when it has these two forms of core conduct, one of which is -- is the conduct about failing to disclose material information, period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.699" offset="14541239">Not in doing anything else, just failing to disclose material information re a conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.853" offset="14561823">Finally, the government in this Court has itself argued the case in a way that I think concedes the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.376" offset="14599962">And -- and that is, essentially, if you look at the main heading in their brief on page 13, their point is -- they finally say this, and then I think they contradict themselves elsewhere, but they say in their heading a</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.536" offset="14652625">"State official's violation of the honest services statute by taking official action while intentionally concealing a material conflict of interest. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.224" offset="14687316">That's it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.858" offset="14689928">No action for--</text>

            <text syncTime="3647.308" offset="14695675">May I ask this question?</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.510" offset="14700481">We might then say the theory that they described there is inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.562" offset="14716677">But would we then send the case back and say decide it on the theory that Mr. Dreeben has explained today?</text>
