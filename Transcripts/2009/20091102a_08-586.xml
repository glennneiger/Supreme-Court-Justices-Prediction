            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-586, Jones v. Harris Associates.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.982" offset="129400">Mr. Frederick.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="6.980" stopTime="135.930">
            <label>Mr. David C. Frederick</label>
            <text syncTime="6.980" offset="133371">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="9.760" offset="144447">In 1970, Congress amended the Investment Company Act to provide a cause of action when an investment adviser breaches its fiduciary duty with respect to compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.802" offset="192616">The Seventh Circuit upheld summary judgment for Respondent under a legal standard for fiduciary duty that Respondent here no longer defends.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.218" offset="234308">For three reasons, the Seventh Circuit's judgment should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.655" offset="252071">First, under the Court's longstanding precedent, in this context a fiduciary duty requires a fair fee, achieved through full disclosure and good-faith negotiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.602" offset="303794">Second, the best gauge of a fair fee is what the investment adviser charges at arm's-length in other transactions for similar services.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.114" offset="349874">And, third, applying that standard here, Harris charged twice as much in percentage terms for providing virtually identical advisory services in arm's-length transactions with institutional investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.640" offset="416016">With respect to the first point, the standard for fiduciary duty has been clear from this Court's cases, at least since Pepper v. Litton, in which the Court said that a fair result in the circumstances -- a fair fee -- was an important component of a fiduciary duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.570" offset="487696">Congress was aware of that standard when it enacted the 1970 amendments to the Investment Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.176" offset="514132">The SEC brought the case to the Congress' attention, and that standard, we submit, is one that Congress intended to incorporate.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.563" offset="547673">Applying that standard, where Pepper said that the best gauge of a fair fee is what the person -- the fiduciary charges in arm's-length transactions, applied here, the best way to understand how that fiduciary duty is being breached in this context is what Harris is charging for same or similar services at arm's-length to institutional investors.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="135.930" stopTime="158.698">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="135.930" offset="649132">Is Harris a fiduciary in the same sense as a corporate officer and a corporate director?</text>
            <text syncTime="141.190" offset="670135">Or does his fiduciary duty differ?</text>
            <text syncTime="147.015" offset="693436">Is it higher or lower, same with a guardian, same with a trustee?</text>
            <text syncTime="151.313" offset="710677">I mean, the word "fiduciary" -- does fiduciary imply different standards, depending on what kind of fiduciary you are?</text>

            <label>Mr. David C. Frederick</label>
            <text syncTime="158.698" offset="740248">The basic concept, Justice Kennedy, is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.058" offset="749652">There are two components, where there must be full disclosure of information and a fair result, and that fair result translates in different contexts in different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.304" offset="786641">Here, because of the statutory references to fiduciary duty with respect to compensation, one focuses on the fairness of the fee charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.144" offset="821959">But, as Professor Dumont points out in her amicus brief, the idea of a fiduciary duty is one that is well known in various circumstances of the law, and as applied here the concept goes to the fairness of the fee.</text>

            <text syncTime="192.936" offset="877129">Well, would the test for compensation in this case be the same as any director or any officer of a corporation?</text>

            <label>Mr. David C. Frederick</label>
            <text syncTime="198.840" offset="900744">The difference here, Justice Kennedy, is that in those circumstances the indicia of an arm's-length transaction may be achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.882" offset="928956">The directors can fire the head of a company.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.616" offset="939928">They can call for changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.851" offset="948809">Here, the investment adviser has appointed the members of the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.770" offset="964483">As this Court said in the Daily Income Fund case, the earmarks of an -- of an arm's-length transaction are absent precisely because--</text>

            <text syncTime="225.124" offset="1005965">I just want to know, is the fiduciary duties the same?</text>
            <text syncTime="228.515" offset="1019444">Is the fiduciary standard the same, without getting into how its applied?</text>
            <text syncTime="231.451" offset="1031252">Is the fiduciary standard the same for Jones, for a guardian, for a trustee, for a corporate officer or a corporate director, always the same?</text>

            <text syncTime="299.374" offset="1302925">The statute prohibits fees that are unreasonable in terms of their unfairness to the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.607" offset="1331869">The concept here is that the board cannot fire the investment adviser.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.247" offset="1350363">So in evaluating the fairness of the fee the adviser is charging the fund, the normal indicia of an arm's-length transaction is absent, and that is the key principle here because this adviser is using the same manager to provide the same research analytics from the same research group, from the same meetings, buying the same stocks, and simply allocating them to different accounts and charging those to whom it owes a fiduciary duty twice what it is getting at arm's-length.</text>

            <text syncTime="1156.158" offset="4730086">We think one salutary affect of that was to -- to make it clear that the Court's burden here, the Court's duty here, wasn't just to establish what the single most reasonable fee would be, but harking back to the Pepper v.

            <text syncTime="2699.078" offset="10901776">If you then go on to page 17, he goes through with respect to each of these three funds and chronicles the fees they paid and by comparison the fees charged to institutional accounts with similar investment objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.524" offset="10963529">The statement by the plaintiff, Petitioners here, that the fee charged was a 2X multiple, does not refer to that array of institutional accounts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2731.237" offset="11030403">And then, Justice Scalia, I would then go to page 32a of the district court's opinion where he describes what appear to be disputed issues of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.996" offset="11089439">And what he said those dispute issues of fact were about were what the Petitioners claimed were flaws in the negotiation process, in substance, what they would have done had they been negotiating, rather than the trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.804" offset="11148685">It is not a dispute about the ultimate test, was this fee so far out of bounds it could not have been reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.486" offset="11179405">To be sure, throughout a record that is as large as this one, you could imagine the parties disputed lots of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.889" offset="11212946">What you could not fairly dispute is whether these fees, for these funds, using comparable funds and using institutional accounts, as Judge Kocoras did, were so far out of bounds, they could not have been fairly bargained, and if that is the test, there is no need for remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.585" offset="11283790">If, as I suggest and as the Solicitor General suggests, Gartenberg is the appropriate standard, Gartenberg is what the district court applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="2894.295" offset="11682628">That's why Judge Kocoras said, this goes to the integrity of the negotiation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2911.367" offset="11750860">Finally, I would -- the other question you asked is where in the record -- Justice Scalia, I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.909" offset="11781057">It's at page 161 and following, where the background of all the difference in fees and the difference in services is chronicled.</text>

            <text syncTime="2938.886" offset="11860992">If you take the plaintiffs' point of view and say that a comparison to institutional accounts is always required and may be dispositive and is always a fraction of what mutual fund charges and that judges are the, in the first instance, the ones to decide who is fair and reasonable or what is fair and reasonable, as opposed to directors, I suggest you consign 8,000 mutual funds to a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.549" offset="11963601">On this record, these were funds that had best in class performance for fees that were at or below industry averages.</text>

            <text syncTime="3009.733" offset="12144368">In fact, on page 30a, the district court said that the disputes were nonmaterial, and that's a very important distinction because the joint appendix that you have before you contains a lot of evidence in which it is disputed whether or not these were similar services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.287" offset="12206540">The Harris manager on page 6 -- JA 650, the portfolio holdings of the funds, are very similar.</text>

            <text syncTime="3043.814" offset="12280728">On 505 to 506, the Harris research director testimony that the managers of the mutual funds and independent accounts share equally all work done by the research department, and 513 to 514, that the Harris fund manager says all of our analysts do research for all of our clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.178" offset="12358154">There is disputed evidence here as to what constitutes similarity, Justice Sotomayor, these are comparing apples to apples because the record indicates that there are separate contracts for the additional fees that they charge to the mutual funds for the additional services provided.</text>

            <text syncTime="3103.631" offset="12519905">If I could go back to the point, though, about the fiduciary duty, what Judge Cardozo, when he was on the New York Court of Appeals, said, a fiduciary represents the punctilio of honor, and that is contrasted with the morals of the marketplace operating at arm's-length.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.531" offset="12579568">It surely cannot be the case that, where you are dealing with a fiduciary duty -- which is a higher standard recognized in the law -- that you can charge twice as much as what you are obtaining at arm's-length for services that you are providing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.136" offset="12637978">The Gartenberg court, Justice Breyer, in fact, had the opposite language that you are averting to, and that is at page 694 F. 2nd 928, where the Court said,</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.161" offset="12686043">"The test is essentially whether the fee schedule represents a charge within the range of what would have been negotiated at arm's-length in the light of all the surrounding circumstances. "</text>
