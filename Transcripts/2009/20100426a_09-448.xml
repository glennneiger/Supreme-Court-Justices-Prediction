            <text syncTime="1600.839" offset="6508816">A couple of responses, Justice Kennedy: First, if they didn't retain jurisdiction -- and in the Seventh Circuit, for example, that's one circuit which says that these orders have to be final, and final judgment has to be entered -- then we're exactly analogous to a sentence 4 Social Security case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.283" offset="6574540">And this Court has made it clear in a line of decisions that upon entry of final judgment -- and those are exactly analogous in the sense that what happens is that the court finds that the decision below committed some error in law, it vacates that decision, and then sends it back to the Social Security Administration for a new determination without preordaining the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.429" offset="6659176">Regardless of the result there, at the time of the remand and entry of judgment, that plaintiff is eligible for -- for fees.</text>

            <label>Mr. John R. Ates</label>
            <text syncTime="3395.586" offset="13687787">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I have two points on rebuttal: Under their we must have a final judgment on the benefits on her claim for -- final judgment on the merits on her claim for benefits, that is absolutely foreclosed by this Court's decision in Schaefer, where a Social Security claimant comes forward, shows a violation by the Secretary; it's remanded back to the Secretary; the case is closed at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.391" offset="13814951">There was no decision on the merits for the benefits, and yet this Court found that was prevailing party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.063" offset="13849642">Here, we don't need prevailing party, but moreover, even accepting their theory, it leads to absurd results.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.955" offset="13893214">There is a provision in ERISA, 1132(c), that gives a claimant the right to seek documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.226" offset="13930308">And yet, they are saying if the claimant is wholly successful to get the plan document from which certain claims you don't even know if you have until you read those plans, they would say it's a purely procedural victory; you cannot get attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.724" offset="14012332">The whole point of that provision was to require the fiduciary to give the document over so people can understand their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.513" offset="14051516">Moreover, their final judgment on the merits for benefits rule leads to perverse incentives under ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.618" offset="14087879">The plan administrator is incented to deny the first time around, challenge it all the way through the courts, on remand maybe, if they get a conditional judgment, as here, that says if you don't act within 30 days I'm giving you that judgment, they then grant the benefits and the court gets rid of the case, they have succeeded in eliminating the right of claimants to get to court to pursue their rights, because of the cost of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.660" offset="14240016">But moreover, here we have a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.564" offset="14259660">To be clear, that is not our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.916" offset="14273034">We had a conditional judgment by the district court sending it back: If you do not act in accordance with law within 30 days, I will enter judgment on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.926" offset="14333116">We have that, but at the end of the day, it was not a dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.163" offset="14358089">They overlooked district court docket 57.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.400" offset="14378987">There was a judgment entered in Ms. Hardt's favor against Reliance in the amount of attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.005" offset="14417439">The original order merges into that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.057" offset="14433635">We have a final judgment here as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.907" offset="14445025">Although we don't need it under section 502(g)(1), we have it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.644" offset="14468012">This Court should not require a judgment before fees can be awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.733" offset="14496329">The whole -- and it certainly shouldn't adopt a purely procedural rule out of thin air that's not in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.339" offset="14530811">This is a procedural statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.791" offset="14544603">The only way claimants can effectuate their right is ensuring the procedure is followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.480" offset="14579294">That is what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.765" offset="14588489">They did not follow proper procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.133" offset="14601968">They abused their discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.752" offset="14616388">They breached a fiduciary obligation to the claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.989" offset="14637390">In these circumstances, under the clear language and clear structure of this statute, this claimant is entitled to fees.</text>
