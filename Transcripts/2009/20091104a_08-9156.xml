            <text syncTime="2508.149" offset="10139084">And his answer was, I don't recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.517" offset="10148488">I know that we talked a lot to psychologists and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.819" offset="10165729">The specific question was, do you remember talking to any witnesses for mitigation purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.457" offset="10184223">And the first thing that Mr. Dozier remembered was we did talk to psychologists for mitigation purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.526" offset="10208569">The clearest piece of evidence is page 283 of the Joint Appendix, and that is quote where Trotter is asked about the Kilby -- I mean the Taylor Harden report from Dr. Kirkland, and the part we keep quoting is the fact he said that Cary Dozier came and told me that we didn't need a further evaluation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.452" offset="10272204">But what we haven't put in the brief and brought up until now is the rest of the quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.338" offset="10287773">Again, it's on page 283 of the Joint Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.373" offset="10299894">And he starts off right after the dash saying he, meaning Cary Dozier, determined that we didn't need any further evaluators and no further recall because in the course of my preparation, "my" being Trotter, in course of my preparation for the penalty phase I would read things about different psychological evaluations and had raised that to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.769" offset="10377529">And again he looked at the report and thought that that wouldn't be needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.971" offset="10394352">So at the moment Cary Dozier made the decision and told to it Trotter, it was specifically because Trotter had come to him and said, I am getting ready for the penalty phase, just as I was told.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.613" offset="10436880">I have been reading things about having mental health evaluations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.148" offset="10450986">On the page before, 282, he has just said that, I could see issues, but because I was the young attorney, I relied on the senior attorneys to resolve them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.068" offset="10482751">So he goes to Cary Dozier and says I have read all of these things about mental health evaluations for the penalty phase, should we do another one?</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.241" offset="10515456">And Cary Dozier, lead counsel of 22 years, criminal experience on both sides, says, I have read the Kirkland report, we do not need a further evaluation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.929" offset="10550147">It was the very next month that counsel filed a motion to exclude all psychological evidence, and the reason was, as Mr. Trotter told the trial court in the trial court record on pages 2 -- of 72 and 73, we don't want the State to introduce evidence that he is prone to violent behavior, prone to violent behavior being the quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.193" offset="10635201">And the trial court asked Mr. Trotter what evidence do you have that the State will do that?</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.081" offset="10654741">He said the report that was done at Taylor Harden, that being Dr. Kirkland's report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.716" offset="10673340">So, here we are six weeks before trial they are fighting to exclude evidence that he is prone to violent behavior and specifically referring to the Kirkland report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.506" offset="10712419">Again, because the very month before Cary Dozier had told Trotter we will not have another evaluation done because I have read the Kirkland report and we are not going to do it any further.</text>

            <text syncTime="2820.949" offset="11390245">It is an open question under Alabama law whether you can present new witnesses and new evidence in front of the sentencing judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="3243.808" offset="13081725">Look at the smaller subsidiary findings of fact, to see whether or not you can rebut the presumption, and, as Justice Scalia said, you look at the overall decision and see if it was based on a determination of facts, a larger bundle of facts, to see whether or not it was unreasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3261.453" offset="13152256">Mr. Scanlon has said that prejudice also has a 2254(d) bar in it in this case, and we agree with that because there was a merits adjudication on prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.459" offset="13188305">I would simply might like to make the point, regardless of how the Court comes out on the (d)(2) question on deficient performance, it cannot overcome the 2250(d) bar for prejudice here because, again, simply knowing that someone had the low IQ and had a low grammar school kind of education level, we are in the unique position where the sentencer actually knew that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.139" offset="13270956">So we have a very large insight into what the sentencer would have done.</text>

            <text syncTime="3452.892" offset="13918062">And Justice Alito, in your example, the problem in this case was that they looked at subsidiary facts; half of them were immaterial to the claim completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.349" offset="13963828">And then the State court jumped from the fact that those were not rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to deciding immediately that everything was therefore reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3538.946" offset="14262251">--Yes, there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.648" offset="14269043">But in this case, I want to make it clear that whatever the standard the Court adopts in this case, the Petitioner has clearly made its case, because there was evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.586" offset="14308749">They never did any investigation when they had this strong lead.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.407" offset="14324109">And Strickland and Wiggins, if they mean anything, means that you have to make an informed decision after an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.644" offset="14348978">And in this case there was no investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.513" offset="14360472">They now concede that, and there was no reasonable decision made that the investigation should be limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.417" offset="14384086">And the Eleventh Circuit got that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.517" offset="14392550">They simply found the wrong facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.869" offset="14401954">Thank you.</text>
