            <text syncTime="11.056" offset="149671">Because this case arises under the deferential standards of the AEDPA statute, Mr. Spisak must show that the Ohio Supreme Court's decision was contrary to Mills v. Maryland or that it unreasonably applied Strickland v. Washington.</text>

            <text syncTime="55.428" offset="327095">Well, finality in that sense is generally looked at in terms of AEDPA statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.536" offset="355516">Why should the same rule apply to the question of whether a State has acted contrary to or unreasonably in light of Supreme Court precedent when the precedent didn't exist at the time it was rendering its decision?</text>

            <text syncTime="89.666" offset="464081">But I would go further and say the extension of Mills that the Sixth Circuit's ruling made here is not clearly-established law even today, more than 20 years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.739" offset="504414">There is a -- the vast majority of Circuits, Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, Tenth, have rejected the position the Sixth Circuit took here, and in fact, this case is quite distinct from Mills even if Mills were applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.329" offset="554778">But I would take your point and I would agree with it that it's kind of tough to impose on the Ohio Supreme Court Mills when--</text>

            <text syncTime="126.571" offset="611725">But I would say this case is distinct even from Mills, where the Court determined that the jury instructions gave the jury to believe that they could only consider mitigating factors that they had determined unanimously to be present.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.752" offset="672434">And in this case, none of that was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.705" offset="680270">The verdict form was quite different, and in fact the jury was only instructed to be unanimous on the ultimate question of whether the aggravators outweighed the mitigators, a common instruction and one that's upheld around the country consistently.</text>

            <text syncTime="175.066" offset="805658">Under Ohio's current instruction that means no death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.078" offset="829691">But under the instruction that was given here, that all 12 must agree on -- on the aggravators outweighing the mitigators, what is the consequence of a failure of the jurors to agree on that question?</text>

            <text syncTime="210.267" offset="946510">The issue is whether the jury was required to be instructed that at the time, whether they were required to be instructed something that might push them away from unanimity.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.073" offset="981723">This Court has never so held, and in fact, in Jones v. United States the Court rejected that rule in a ruling that was not dissented to by anyone on the panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.085" offset="1017772">Your dissent in that case at footnote 20 took no issue with the -- with the notion that the jury did not have to be instructed in ways that would push them away from rendering unanimous verdict on the ultimate question.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.408" offset="1063016">Since that time, as a matter of State court practice the Ohio Supreme Court in State v. Brooks did say: We are now going to add that instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.343" offset="1094781">But they later themselves rejected that that was required by the Eighth Amendment in State v. Davis, and that also has been the consistent holding of most circuits, that that is not required.</text>

            <text syncTime="292.481" offset="1275340">Since that time, the Ohio Supreme Court as a matter of practice has been willing to go further and instruct the jury, or have the jury be instructed, that if a single one of you feels that the aggravators do not outweigh the mitigators, that will preclude a death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.176" offset="1326122">But that has never been constitutionally required by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="341.209" offset="1470213">But the jury could believe that they could -- that it's either death or life, and one holdout juror would say: Well, I don't want to let this guy out; because those are the only two choices and 11 people want to go for dead -- death and I'm the only holdout, I have to vote for death to make sure that he is restrained in a way that I find acceptable.</text>

            <text syncTime="369.761" offset="1584421">It is the push towards unanimity.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.293" offset="1590585">The issue here is whether the Constitution requires an instruction to be given that would encourage a single juror to hold out and try to avoid reaching a unanimous verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.820" offset="1628724">The Court has never held that that is constitutionally required, and if they did so hold in this case it would be an extension that is a new rule and would not be applicable on AEDPA review here.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.597" offset="1663833">Second, on the ineffectiveness claim, Mr. Spisak loses sight of the fact that this was no run-of-the-mill trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.439" offset="1687134">His crimes were among the most infamous in Ohio history.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.296" offset="1698628">At the trial he groomed himself to look like Adolf Hitler, and on the stand he celebrated his victims' deaths, spewed his racist beliefs, and pledged to continue his own brand of personal warfare against society.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.774" offset="1744499">In the sentencing phase, defense counsel reasonably took the only tack available to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.102" offset="1761844">He used the sheer depravity of his client's crimes and his disturbing character to tell a story about his client's mental illness, and he asked the jury to forego the death penalty for Mr. Spisak because he is mentally ill and thus, under the mitigating factor, lacked substantial capacity to appreciate or conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="477.321" offset="2014710">The first was, he -- he did go back and recapitulate the nature of the crimes, something this Court said in Yarborough is an acceptable defense strategy.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.319" offset="2046683">That's the elephant in the room.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.567" offset="2051699">The jury heard weeks of testimony about this crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.254" offset="2062461">The prosecutor was surely going to highlight that.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.660" offset="2072074">He was attempting to take this sting out and identify with the jury that he understood how they would react to the crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.172" offset="2094122">The second piece of the closing -- this is at petition appendix, approximately 339a to 344a, he goes into the mitigating factor of mental illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.699" offset="2132261">He had presented three mental health experts in the sentencing phase to demonstrate that his client was mentally ill.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.992" offset="2161413">He had made a continued argument that there was a larger jar of not guilty by reason of insanity that he had not been able to fulfill, even though he had tried at trial, and that evidence had ultimately been struck by the trial court, which found they have not made out a defense of not guilty by reason of insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.953" offset="2225256">But he pursued the same theme here in sentencing, presenting evidence and saying: We have at least fulfilled the smaller jar of mental illness, diminished capacity to intend, and because we are a humane society our general assembly has made that a mitigating factor that you should apply here, and you should not execute someone who has a diminished ability to intend.</text>

            <text syncTime="647.668" offset="2696088">The person in Landrigan had repeated -- had committed repeated murders and tried to kill again and again.</text>

            <text syncTime="670.909" offset="2789083">In Landrigan this Court approved the court of appeals statement in the end that any further, minor mitigating evidence that could have been presented in the wake of that record could not have been helpful; there is no prejudice.</text>

            <text syncTime="879.897" offset="3625002">He at trial attempted to establish a defense of not guilty by reason of insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.861" offset="3644855">He was set back, he and his trial team, because in the end the trial judge rejected that defense and struck that testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.625" offset="3667947">He renewed his effort at the sentencing phase by bringing several mental health experts and having them testify on the stand to show that at least they had met the lower standard of mental disease or defect under the Ohio Revised Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.869" offset="3716848">He then argued, perhaps not as eloquently as -- as one might, you know, as -- as Justice Jackson once said, you know, in their bed that night, but he argued about: Yes, these crimes were brutal.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.925" offset="3769093">He went on at some length about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.973" offset="3777348">But these crimes were brutal and the jury had heard all that and clearly had that in their minds.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.063" offset="3793648">He then pivoted to five pages of closing arguments, in addition to days of presentation on the subject, to say: We have shown at least mental illness; it is a mitigating factor; the General Assembly made it a mitigating factor and we as a humane people should be proud that we do not execute someone who has substantial deficiency in ability to intend.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.164" offset="3874105">He then went on to handle some rebuttal points that he was -- he was feeling the heat on from the prosecutor's presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.550" offset="3903572">For example, that he had not necessarily met with these experts before they came and testified at trial; that he had perhaps shopped for experts and other matters of that sort; that maybe the -- the jury was going to hold against him and his defense team their deficiency as counsel, because they had made this effort to get not a -- a not guilty by reason of insanity plea and the judge had knocked that out.</text>

            <text syncTime="1030.252" offset="4226445">And I think again counsel in the context of this proceeding judged, perhaps rightly, that it was very unlikely this jury was going to have sympathy for his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.245" offset="4266360">Instead he appealed to the jury's own sense of humanity and pride: We have this mitigating factor under the law, we are a civilized people, we do not execute people who have substantial diminished ability to intend; and I appeal to you, you jury, even though I can sense that you are not feeling sympathy for my client, do what -- what makes you a humane people, what makes us proud as a people, and do not give the death penalty to a person who is sick, demented, twisted, as my client has shown himself to be here on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.611" offset="4379836">I think it's a coherent strategy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.483" offset="4387359">In fact, I don't see easily how he could have done better.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.358" offset="4402824">And as in Landrigan, if he had said, give him sympathy, give him a life sentence, which was the thrust of the entire proceedings, I don't think that that created -- that lack of saying that created any prejudice on this record, which was very thoroughly established, in part by his client 's own testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.209" offset="4470220">I would also say in Yarborough, on the deficiency point, this Court said that focusing in on one particular theme may well be a preferable strategy, and there has to be broad deference given to closing, which is only a part, after all, of the entire sentencing proceeding, in that taking an understated approach that -- that emphasizes the jury's autonomy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.840" offset="4552767">In Yarborough, if you remember, the defense counsel did not actually ask specifically in so many words for a life sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.649" offset="4580039">The Court said that's not deficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.961" offset="4589234">He could count on the judge's charge to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.005" offset="4597488">They were going to charge the jury as to how to handle the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.207" offset="4610236">It was the thrust of the whole proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.035" offset="4617550">He presented three mental health experts to show mental illness and diminished ability to intend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.407" offset="4643046">And he argued that as part of his closing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.452" offset="4655271">I think it was not deficient, and I certainly think on this record, this stunning record created in part by his client's crimes, which were acknowledged and undisputed and there was no factual dispute about them and their heinousness, and then by his client's testimony on the stand, which graphically and at great length reinforced his, again, triumph in his -- in his warfare against trying to kill as many black people, Jewish people and gay people as he could find, and that he would continue that warfare if given the chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.830" offset="4784734">I think it's impossible to find that there is prejudice on this record for the -- for the -- for the -- even the medium-sized quibbles that are being raised here 20 years after the fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="1194.818" offset="4884731">The Sixth Circuit evaluated performance of trial counsel in this case and found deficient performance for three primary areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.973" offset="4913361">First, counsel presented and argued to the jury nonstatutory aggravating factors as reasons to impose the death sentence on Mr. Spisak.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.673" offset="4948156">In Ohio, the jury is allowed to consider only the statutory aggravator factors, not nonstatutory factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.311" offset="4974696">The counsel specifically identified and argued four reasons to execute Mr. Spisak.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.152" offset="4997998">He then proceeded to tell the jury what was not mitigating evidence in this case, including factors that have long been accepted as mitigating factors like performance in prison, adaptive skills and the issue regarding his family upbringing and childhood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.083" offset="5057766">Finally, the lawyer turned to what he argued was the only mitigating evidence that they were going to be arguing, and that was the issue of the client's mental health.</text>

            <text syncTime="3170.993" offset="12789384">I am simply summarizing a response to Justice Sotomayor's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.821" offset="12800669">But this Court -- on -- on Teague, in Beard v Banks determined that Mills itself expressed a new rule and expressed some doubt as to whether that rule itself was even clear until McKoy v. North Carolina was decided in 1990, which was subsequent to finality in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.253" offset="12858452">But the -- the jury instruction issue is entirely knocked out by the fact that this case is an extension of Mills that goes beyond anything this Court has ever held in the jury instruction context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.246" offset="12902442">It is an extension of Mills that has been rejected by the majority of circuits to consider it, even today 20 years later, and it couldn't possibly be understood to be clearly established law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.353" offset="12942879">The reference to page 326a and the jury instructions, that's quite distinct from the passage where the jury was told specifically they have to be unanimous only on the ultimate question, whether aggravators outweigh mitigators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.269" offset="13002543">This was very different from the jury form in Mills which was itself was somewhat cryptic and -- and later was explained further in McKoy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.563" offset="13027621">If I could return then to the ineffectiveness issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.452" offset="13039219">Counsel argued that there was deficiency on a couple of different grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.120" offset="13057923">First of all, that -- that defense counsel should have argued about family background and performance in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.197" offset="13078194">The family background was uncontested; it was humdrum; there was nothing special there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.319" offset="13094703">Performance in prison was an issue that was raised at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.786" offset="13108600">The prosecutor read to Spisak on the stand a letter he had written from prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.505" offset="13127408">I am not going to foul the record with his specific verbiage but it was after a card game in which he had gotten into a fight with inmates and said he would like to kill them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.768" offset="13160532">When that was read to Spisak on the stand his response was to say "Heil, Hitler" and give the Nazi salute to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.185" offset="13186132">So the notion that we should be referring back to his performance in prison and that somehow would have helped mitigate the jury's consideration of the death sentence to me is -- is fanciful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.556" offset="13223643">In terms of the argument that defense counsel here argued, nonstatutory aggravators, that is a characterization that I don't think is accurate and it's not accurate as a matter of Ohio law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.647" offset="13268052">In our reply brief we cited State v. Hancock which indicates that the nature and circumstances of crimes are always relevant in determining whether the aggravators outweigh the mitigators, and in fact the main aggravator here was that Mr. Spisak engaged in a course of conduct that involved the purposeful killing of more than one person -- two or more persons, or the attempt to kill two or more persons which he had done here and which certainly was going to be and was, in fact, in fact if you read the prosecutor's closing, the heart and soul of the prosecutor's closing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.445" offset="13391245">As to whether the mental health presentation was, quote, "not strong enough", obviously it wasn't strong enough in the end to sway the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.115" offset="13421861">But you cannot judge by hindsight, this Court has said it again and again, counsel's performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.958" offset="13441296">The court said that in Strickland v. Washington itself, emphasized that tremendously in rejecting the deficiency claim in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.627" offset="13467941">And then in Yarborough as applied to closing arguments, the Court said very specifically we have to be doubly deferential to -- to strategic decisions made at closing, even if we might had made them differently or might have executed them somewhat differently, and particularly through the AEDPA lens.</text>

            <text syncTime="3367.272" offset="13574520">The statute -- the AEDPA statute, 2254 says we defer to what?</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.721" offset="13592283">We defer to an adjudication by the State court on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.473" offset="13607330">There is no suggestion here that this adjudication was on some procedural grounds or default grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.296" offset="13626556">It was a merits adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.344" offset="13634811">It wasn't a lengthy, eloquent, you know, long explained adjudication, but it was an adjudication on the merits and deference should be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.919" offset="13665113">The alternative is that if they don't explain which prong they are using that you defer to nothing, and that seems to be not consistent with what Congress clearly intended under AEDPA, nor is it consistent with the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.866" offset="13716835">The claim was made that the deference only applies when the State court, quote, "has done its job".</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.488" offset="13735330">Under the statute the job is to adjudicate a claim on the merits, not to provide a lengthy discourse in doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.503" offset="13763438">As to the prejudice point which I think is finally decisive and was the basis on which this Court GVR'd in -- in Landrigan, this is Landrigan--</text>

            <text syncTime="3471.303" offset="13990599">However, if the Court was inclined to make gradation -- this is a gradation beyond simply an unexplained order.</text>

            <text syncTime="3477.894" offset="14017034">As to prejudice, the Ohio Supreme Court at 309(a) through 311(a) itself independently reweighed the aggravating factors against the mitigating factors, which is something the Ohio Supreme Court does under Ohio law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.812" offset="14064682">There had been some issues of merger of some of the aggravating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.185" offset="14078161">On direct appeal, they had dealt with those issues, and then they went back and reweighed, and they found that, on this record, the aggravating factors heavily -- lie heavily and beyond a reasonable doubt to outweigh the mitigating factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.885" offset="14128943">That is, in fact, the same kind of determination that the Court would make in trying to determine if there was prejudice here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.788" offset="14152558">As to the implementation of the strategy here, it is coherent in understanding what counsel was trying to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.143" offset="14189965">Was it a bit rambling?</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.937" offset="14233119">Perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.035" offset="14233015">You know, were there -- were there side issues that he tried to take up, which he thought went to his credibility with the jury and the credibility of the mental illness defense with the jury?</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.624" offset="14235941">But the strategy was twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.264" offset="14246494">It was to reference the crimes, make it clear to the jury he understood the nature -- the horrific nature of the crimes, as he thought the jury understood it, and then pivot to the mental illness -- mental disease or defect prong as the mitigator that the -- that the jury should apply in not giving the death penalty in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.347" offset="14314830">I think the strategy was coherent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.860" offset="14320891">I'm not sure what else defense counsel could have done in this case, where his client had both committed these horrific crimes, undisputed, and then had reveled in them, in his flamboyant testimony from the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.995" offset="14369374">In the context of that and given the doubly deferential lens this Court has laid out in Yarborough, I think that there is neither deficiency, nor could there be prejudice on this record.</text>
