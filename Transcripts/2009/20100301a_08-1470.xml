            <label>Mr. B. Eric Restuccia</label>
            <text syncTime="7.090" offset="133789">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In rejecting Mr. Thompkins's Miranda claim and ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the Michigan courts did not unreasonably apply clearly established Supreme Court precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.740" offset="200349">I plan to focus on the Miranda claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.082" offset="213723">Now, with respect to the Miranda claim, there really are two distinct inquiries at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.250" offset="230442">The first is whether Mr. Thompkins impliedly waived his rights under the Fifth Amendment and, second, whether he invoked his right to remain silent during a police interview.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.793" offset="268581">Regarding the waiver question, this Court established in Butler that there may be an implied waiver, even where a suspect remains silent after having received his Miranda warnings, where that suspect knowingly receives his rights and there is a course of conduct that indicates waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.518" offset="347470">The Michigan courts here did not unreasonably conclude that Mr. Thompkins had impliedly waived his rights where he expressly acknowledged his rights under -- from his form.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.777" offset="396476">After having read out loud from that form, he participated in a limited fashion during the interview.</text>

            <text syncTime="80.837" offset="428763">And quite unlike Butler -- Butler, if I have it right, said, "I'll talk to you".</text>
            <text syncTime="88.523" offset="459483">So that was a statement--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="92.629" offset="475888">--that he was waiving the right to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.285" offset="486546">He volunteered to talk.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.970" offset="493338">Here there was no such indication that there was a waiver of his right to remain silent.</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="114.966" offset="565332">So the -- the standard that was established from which the Michigan courts relied is really on this -- this language of the standard established from Butler, that you can -- you can imply waiver from the knowing reception, and then a course of conduct, because the -- the inference can be drawn from the words and actions of the person interrogated.</text>

            <text syncTime="160.508" offset="747457">The latter might imply to me that he waived, but the former certainly would be neutral.</text>

            <text syncTime="987.077" offset="4053723">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondent's confession was properly admitted at his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.529" offset="4083503">I'd like to go right to some of the questions that this Court had about the language that was used in the Miranda decision and in the Butler decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.119" offset="4109939">Both -- all of this language comes up in Butler.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.509" offset="4119448">Now, Butler was a case not about the waiver of the right to silence, but a waiver of the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.760" offset="4136479">So the suspect said "I will talk to you", but the North Carolina Supreme Court said: Well, we don't know if he waived his right to counsel, and that's why the court got into a question of implied waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.850" offset="4172842">So the Court in its analysis in Butler first reviewed this language that the Court has talked about this morning from Miranda that says</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.579" offset="4203771">"A valid waiver will not be presumed simply from the silence of the accused or simply from the fact that a confession was in fact eventually obtained. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.780" offset="4232505">And this is our understanding of that language: First, it is not the case that a failure to invoke Miranda rights will be taken in the Miranda context as a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.354" offset="4270853">Now, Justice Scalia, I think you alluded to the fact that the normal rule for the Fifth Amendment at trial is that you assert your rights or they are waived.</text>

            <text syncTime="1123.565" offset="4599683">And the way that we understand that is that the government can't just go into court and say: Look, we have a confession; we know he waived his rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1540.731" offset="6268385">So my question is, how does one infer a voluntary statement from a situation in which someone's really not talking?</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.710" offset="6320212">I've never understood how a yes or a nod to questions that don't -- that's what the circuit said, to questions that we don't know what they were about -- do you want a mint or not, I don't even know that -- can reflect voluntariness?</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.985" offset="6381338">And I understand that in Butler when someone says I don't want to sign that, but I'm going to spill my guts now, and does, that's a course of conduct one could view as voluntary.</text>
