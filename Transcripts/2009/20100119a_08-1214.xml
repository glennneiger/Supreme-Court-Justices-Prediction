            <text syncTime="2531.593" offset="10231787">The first is that, in our view, the issue as to whether or not a tort claim can be brought under 301 begins and ends with the clear language of section 301, which talks about suits for violation of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.323" offset="10286749">The second point I'd like to make is that allowing the tort action, as Granite Rock is urging, would work a big change in the structure that Congress has established by which it has decided that major issues of labor law, such as the weapons -- economic weapons that parties can use, should be decided by Congress through statute and by the National Labor Relations Board through the application of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3484.942" offset="14045142">I think the argument was that -- anyway, I have this argument: 301 doesn't pre-empt anything but the contract claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.456" offset="14079206">Now, go bring your claim in State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.158" offset="14090073">You might have a good claim in State court that isn't pre-empted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3506.592" offset="14131764">Now, yours might be, because there is a set of tort actions in State court that the labor acts pre-empt; in particular, those that involve conduct that is arguably protected or arguably forbidden by the labor acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.364" offset="14198847">So, if you fall outside that category, you are not pre-empted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.317" offset="14218700">And if you fall inside the category, you should be pre-empted; not by 301, but by the labor law which gave this kind of decision to the labor board to make.</text>

            <text syncTime="3543.077" offset="14277736">--Justice Breyer, there is a fundamental aspect of that that's just not right, and that is that the conduct involved here was causing a violation of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.901" offset="14320995">The international took control of the local and forced the breach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.384" offset="14342938">This is the -- this conduct would never be sanctioned if the jurisdiction of the NLRB had access to it, but the -- wisely, I think, the structure of the National Labor Relations Board is -- the 8(b)(3) remedy is against an exclusive agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.331" offset="14402706">They have to be the bargaining agent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3577.486" offset="14415350">And so, consequently, if we accepted the position of the international, you would create a no-man's zone that would apply throughout this country, whereby collective bargaining agreements entered into by locals could be destroyed, violated, by an international that would choose to impose itself on the local and cause that to happen.</text>

            <text syncTime="3619.515" offset="14583474">You're -- you're begging Justice Breyer's question, which is: If the law pre-empts this claim and it's doing so unjustly, who should make that determination?</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.945" offset="14645227">Should it be you in a State court, you in a Federal court, or should it be in the first instance the NLRB who says this is or isn't an unfair labor practice, and if it rules it's not because the law doesn't cover it, or it's not authorized to issue this--</text>

            <text syncTime="3667.369" offset="14774899">What is suggested here is that maybe there is a no-man's zone that Congress should go to and regulate, but if you back up to 1947 and the passage of section 301, it's inconceivable that in passing that statute Congress intended to leave all international unions, or anybody that controlled a party, completely free from any reach of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3702.668" offset="14916065">In other words, 8(b)(3) contemplates a bargaining obligation on the part of an exclusive representative, and the international is not in that capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.991" offset="14957338">They had control, but they aren't designated in that manner, and there's not one NLRB case in the history of that agency that deviates from that, or we would have been on it immediately.</text>

            <text syncTime="3728.108" offset="15017838">So we were looking at our options, and State court appeared to be very clearly pre-empted by Allis -- Chalmers and a row of cases.</text>
