            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="5.157" offset="126056">First case in which I have the opinion is 08-1214, Granite Rock Company versus the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.972" offset="189273">This case comes to us on the writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.177" offset="222083">Petitioner Granite Rock is a California Company that that employs members of the respondent unions, Teamsters local and its parent respondent International Brotherhood of Teamster.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.625" offset="279970">I will refer to former as local and the later as IBT.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.394" offset="302958">Granite Rock’s relationship with local is governed by a collective bargaining agreement or CBA that Granite Rock negotiated with local on July 2nd, 2004.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.318" offset="358651">This case arose out of a strike that local initiated, Granite Rock sued the Union and in District Court claiming that strike violated the CBAs No Strike clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.891" offset="412985">Granite Rock also sued IBT for interfering with the CBA.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.027" offset="433570">Local and IBT moved to dismiss Granite Rock suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.523" offset="451542">The District Court granted IBT’s motion to dismiss finding that a Federal Court can not recognize a tort claim for interference with the CBA by a non-signatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.578" offset="503683">Local in turn argued that its strike did not violate the CBA’s No Strike Provision because its members had not yet voted to ratify the CBA and thus the CBA was not yet enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.856" offset="568884">Local also argued that Granite Rock’s No Strike claim did not belong in Federal Court because the CBA required all disputes arising under its provision to go to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.375" offset="634922">The District Court agreed with local that Granite Rock’s No Strike claim was arbitratable but held that there was a factual question about when the CBA was ratified and this question was before that Court not an Arbitrator to resolve.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.181" offset="718096">After Jury found that the CBA was ratified on July 2nd, the court sent Granite Rocks No-Strike claim to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.716" offset="756234">All parties appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.872" offset="764907">The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's dismissal of Granite Rocks claims against IBT but reversed the District Court's arbitration rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.411" offset="807016">In an opinion filed with the Clerk, we reversed in part, affirm in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.724" offset="828332">We reversed the Court of Appeal’s arbitration ruling because it does not accord with our decisions that arbitration is strictly a matter of agreement, thus a Court may not order parties to arbitrate the particular dispute unless the court is satisfied that the parties agreed to arbitrate that dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.391" offset="910984">The record and arguments probably before us do not establish that Granite Rock agreed to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.149" offset="938047">We affirm the District Court, the Court of Appeals refusal to recognize new Federal tort claim under the Labor Management Relations Act, that Granite Rock alleges against IBT even assuming that the Act authorizes us to recognize the claim, the record does not support Granite Rock’s argument that such a claim would be necessary to supplement other means of addressing IBT’s alleged interference with the CBA.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.771" offset="1060509">Justice Sotomayor has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, in which Justice Stevens joins.</text>
