            <text syncTime="1090.401" offset="4469029">First, if we are looking just at the language of 1328, which is reproduced at the page 3 of the appendix to the blue brief, it states, as the Chief Justice notes, that:</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.257" offset="4504451">"The court shall grant the debtor a discharge. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.223" offset="4512392">of certain debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.890" offset="4515004">There is then a comma, and it says "except any debt" -- now, I can see that that language is subject to a degree of ambiguity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.196" offset="4540291">But I think even that language is susceptible to being read as a legal limitation on the effect of the discharge order that the provision has just told the court to grant.</text>
