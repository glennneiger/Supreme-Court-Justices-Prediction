            <text syncTime="397.323" offset="1695786">The first is that I think that a decision by a district court judge to correct a sentence under 3582(c) should be analogous to a decision of a district court judge to correct a sentence under 2255.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.882" offset="1750016">Once the decision is made that the sentence should be corrected, finality is extinguished; and when the court goes about imposing the new sentence, it must comport with the law of the land at the time.</text>

            <text syncTime="448.570" offset="1900690">But with respect to fairness, which I think is at the heart of your question, the fact that this partial remedy for an urgent and compelling problem, that is, the crack guideline, was afforded to some should not prevent the Court from seeing justice for those like Mr. Dillon, even though there are some in prison that are serving unconstitutional sentences that will not be able to seek relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.968" offset="1982297">Mr. Dillon is properly compared to other defendants who are sentenced under the amended crack guideline, not the original crack guideline.</text>

            <text syncTime="1632.732" offset="6637422">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act at issue in this case, unlike the provisions that were at issue in Booker, do not govern the imposition of sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.555" offset="6684651">They instead provide a discretionary mechanism for the exercise of leniency for defendants who have already been sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.316" offset="6715685">The district court in this case properly exercised its authority under the statute to reduce Petitioner's sentence by a little bit more than 4 years, which was the maximum amount of reduction that was consistent with the sentencing commission's specifications under section 994(u) about whether and to what extent its crack cocaine amendments warranted reductions in already imposed sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.324" offset="6803769">The district court had neither a further obligation nor indeed the authority to set Petitioner's sentence aside altogether and resentence Petitioner under the advisory guidelines regime announced in Booker.</text>

            <text syncTime="1702.385" offset="6915992">Yes, Justice Ginsburg, the same rule applies to the calculation error that Petitioner is raising.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.102" offset="6938875">Section 3582(c)(2) was not designed by Congress to serve as effectively a less restrictive substitute for raising such challenges on direct appeal or where otherwise available under section 2255.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.035" offset="6994568">It was instead designed for the limited purpose of providing an opportunity to extend leniency to defendants whose sentences are otherwise final, nonappealable and therefore not subject to any modification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.997" offset="7046395">Justice Sotomayor, you had asked earlier whether this provision was designed as an act of clemency or was instead designed as a kind of adjunct to the court's judicial review power, a kind of 2255-type power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.025" offset="7098535">We think the answer is clearly that it was designed as a mechanism for the exercise of a type of clemency power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.257" offset="7123508">I think that is particularly clear if you look at the parallel provisions in section 3582(c)(1) which are reprinted at pages 3a and 4a of the appendix to the government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.610" offset="7172932">Those provisions also provide for similar types of sentence reductions in cases where the director of the Bureau of Prisons makes a motion for sentence reduction based either on extraordinary and compelling reasons or because the defendant is over the age of 70 and has served more than 30 years in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.683" offset="7237193">In all of these cases the district court exercises a discretionary power to reduce the sentence in the exercise of leniency, not because of legal error but for ethical reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="1812.777" offset="7357565">We think that what Congress has called for in all of the sentence reduction provisions of section 3582(c) is a kind of discretionary mechanism for reducing sentences that are already final and not appealable and can't be modified in any other respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.223" offset="7419319">It hasn't called for a de novo plenary resentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.439" offset="7432171">So it allows defendants in the position that Petitioner is in to come into court and reopen every aspect of their sentence, requiring reconsideration of guidelines determinations made in this case more than a decade ago or requiring application of intervening changes in the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1876.327" offset="7611789">One is the Sixth Amendment question, whether this is a statutory provision that calls for a resentencing, at which Booker and its decision about the Sixth Amendment would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.997" offset="7650450">And then the second question is even if you think there is no constitutional problem with reading the statute in accordance with its plain terms, whether Booker's remedial analysis requires treating the reference to the policy statements in section 3582(c)(2) as purely advisory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.116" offset="7718891">We think with respect to that question, not even Petitioner is quite willing to embrace the full consequences of that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.282" offset="7751596">It would mean severing and excising the portion of 3582(c)(2) that requires consistency with the applicable policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1931.618" offset="7832889">The remedial opinion basically rewrote the whole statute on -- except that it didn't have to reach 3582(c)(2), but it certainly changed the -- the nature of the mandatory provisions that were previously in the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1944.397" offset="7883985">--That's true, and it did so in order to solve the constitutional difficulties that were created by a mandatory guidelines system with respect to the imposition of sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.484" offset="7924423">Without that same kind of Sixth Amendment violation in the context of discretionary sentence reduction proceedings, we think there is no basis in Booker's analysis for severing and excising any portion of 3582(c)(2), but I would note that the consequence of severing and excising the requirements' consistency with the applicable policy statements would be to free district courts not only from the sentencing commission's specifications about how much to reduce sentences, but also which of its amendments to the guidelines would justify retroactive application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.032" offset="8058587">Because it is after all in a policy statement, section 1B1.10, that the sentencing commission has specified which of its amendments, among many, justify sentence reductions under 3582(c)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.717" offset="8109265">That would mean that every time the sentencing commission revises its guidelines and reduces applicable sentencing ranges, any number of defendants would be free to come to the district courts and ask them to make their own independent judgment about whether or not they should be effectively resentenced as a consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.988" offset="8178437">And that would certainly provide a significant disincentive for the sentencing commission ever to revise sentencing guidelines in a downward direction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2043.120" offset="8278956">I believe that right now, the current number of -- of guidelines amendments the sentencing commission has made retroactive stands at 27.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.493" offset="8312393">This was the -- one of the first decisions that the sentencing commission made about retroactivity in the wake of Booker, and it did so with full consciousness of the potential for broadly reopening sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.970" offset="8382297">And it certainly weighed very heavily in the sentencing commission's deliberations that the traditional understanding, existing long before Booker was ever decided, was that 3582(c)(2) proceedings do not constitute plenary resentencings that incorporate all intervening changes to the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2772.317" offset="11195685">If the Court has no further questions, we would ask that the judgment of the court of appeals be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2787.623" offset="11256916">A couple of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.374" offset="11263916">I wanted to answer Justice Kennedy's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.404" offset="11276037">The court is not only permitted to consider bad behavior in prison, under 1B1.10, the court is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.573" offset="11308743">The word is "shall".</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.696" offset="11313236">And, so, all of these things and many of your questions point to the fact that this is an adversarial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.819" offset="11345732">Section 3582(c) describes a sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.112" offset="11362868">It requires the court to consider all of the 3553(a) factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.066" offset="11378751">It requires the court to be consistent with policy statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.956" offset="11390245">It requires a court to impose a new sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.436" offset="11400171">And the word 3582(c) connotes correction, not leniency, not grace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.185" offset="11431205">Those are functions of the executive branch, not of the judicial branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.369" offset="11447923">And in this context the court decided after the commission reduced the sentencing -- the sentencing guidelines for crack offenders, that a correction was warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.991" offset="11498392">There was an error in the prior sentence that 3582(c) permitted the district court to correct, and when it imposed a new sentence, that new sentence has to comport with current law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2914.447" offset="11764214">One point that I would like to get back to, because there were many questions about it, is this consistent with policy statements.</text>

            <text syncTime="2924.364" offset="11803920">The sentencing commission in this case changed the 1B1.10 to say that the sentencing court could not, shall not impose a sentence below the guideline range.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.780" offset="11849582">1B1.10 for all of the 26 retroactive amendments that preceded the crack amendment read district courts should sentence within the amended guideline range, and that is appropriately a policy statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.121" offset="11902976">1B1.10(b)(2)(A) is not a policy statement.</text>
