            <text syncTime="167.355" offset="773810">We don't read it that no other government agency is bound, who has jurisdiction over that criminal activity, that they are equally bound.</text>

            <text syncTime="190.137" offset="864925">Assuming that's correct, does that mean that -- why does that mean that both the U.S. Attorney's Office and the Attorney General's Office, which appear to be two different entities enforcing two different sets of law, why would both be bound?</text>

            <text syncTime="287.498" offset="1254358">There is some -- some provisions for consent if there are multiple offenses and one goes to one, one goes to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.001" offset="1284451">But all the offenses we're talking about here are United States offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.119" offset="1296886">It was the United States's position below that only the United States prosecutes contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.671" offset="1319037">It was actually the Attorney General's conviction in the lower court that it could not, representing the District of Columbia, prosecute contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.761" offset="1351429">So that if we are construing the party to be the United States as the Solicitor General now asks -- you know, Young and Providence Journal really apply, which is then the prosecuting entity is the United States, whether represented by a private prosecutor or by a United States attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.425" offset="1426139">That's a very different situation than different offices or -- because the District of Columbia could not be prosecuting this case representing the -- the Attorney General couldn't be prosecuting this case representing the District of Columbia government.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.184" offset="1485176">That's not in the picture as an option.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.802" offset="1499596">The -- the case -- if it's prosecuted by a sovereign, it's prosecuted by the United States, and the only argument that the Solicitor General is now making is that that wouldn't bind if private prosecutor representing the United States, as happened in Young.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.514" offset="1570440">We have a local case that says when a private prosecutor in a criminal contempt case signs the plea agreement on behalf of the United States, it's a binding plea agreement and binds the -- the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.921" offset="1620072">So the cross-out on the plea form, I believe, are a bit of a red herring.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.642" offset="1642956">The cross-out on the caption just makes it read United States v. John Robertson in a felony, which is the only way felonies can be prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.546" offset="1670541">The cross-out on the signature line just makes it read the United States Attorney, who is the only one who can sign such a form in a felony case.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.085" offset="1708784">And it doesn't define a particular prosecuting entity between Federal and State, or between two different Federal jurisdictions that have concurrent jurisdiction over, let's say, mail fraud or something like that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1423.664" offset="5799037">This started out as a case about a plea agreement, and the Petitioner's claim is that his plea agreement with the U.S. Attorney barred his criminal contempt proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.956" offset="5852223">He has not made the claim that a private interested party may not bring a criminal contempt proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1447.996" offset="5896422">Yes, but the argument is that because a private interested party can't bring it, the party is bringing it on behalf of the United States and his plea agreement therefore is with the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1472.545" offset="5994538">One is according to the question presented, whether the criminal contempt proceeding for violating a civil protective order must be brought in the name of the United States, so actually have United States in the caption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.388" offset="6049917">And I think now all the parties agree, there is no constitutional requirement that the caption of the case actually say "United States".</text>
