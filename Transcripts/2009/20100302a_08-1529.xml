            <text syncTime="5.276" offset="126474">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In section 233(a), Congress extended an absolute immunity to officers and employees of the Public Health Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.884" offset="164927">That provision, reflecting Congress's policy judgment that the immunity was necessary to revitalize the Public Health Service, makes a claim against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act the exclusive remedy for injury or death resulting from the performance of medical or related functions and precludes any other civil action or proceeding against the individuals by reason of the same subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.122" offset="253952">Without grappling with the language of section 233(a), Respondents have tried in a number of different ways to imply a limitation into the test for constitutional claims, but none of those arguments creates any ambiguity in the statute, for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.243" offset="310376">First, the Bivens exception, found in the Westfall Act itself, applies only to the immunity set forth in the Westfall Act and says nothing about the scope of the entirely separate and distinct immunity set forth in section 233.</text>

            <text syncTime="78.356" offset="418837">Public Health Service employees can take advantage both of the immunities set forth in the Westfall Act and also of the separate, preexisting, more specific immunity that's afforded to them by section 233(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="90.429" offset="467111">And this Court's decision in Smith, I think, made clear that those two immunities can coexist.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.599" offset="491771">There's no conflict between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.662" offset="496055">And what this Court said in Smith is that the Westfall Act immunity adds to the prior immunity, and employees can take advantage of both of them.</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="107.751" offset="536388">Counsel, our job is to determine Congress's intent when it passed 233(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="116.170" offset="570138">What we do know is that there was no Bivens immunity at the time; the FTCA had only a limited application under certain driver-related accidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.740" offset="632414">So we really don't have anything to tell us, because they didn't even know that there was a constitutional claim that could be raised, what they would have intended or not intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.550" offset="667627">And I thought that Justice Ginsburg's point would be that the Westfall Act tells us what they intended, because by its nature it applied to all employees and didn't differentiate among them, and copied 233's immunity, so that one can look at it and say, ah, that speaks of Congress's intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="167.959" offset="777237">Well, certainly it's true that when Congress enacted the Westfall Act it could have broadly said, for instance, notwithstanding any other provision of law, no Federal employee shall assert a statutory immunity to constitutional claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.645" offset="828019">But it didn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.503" offset="831467">It did something much more narrow than that, which is that what it said was in section 2679(b)(2), paragraph (1) -- the immunity for Federal employees that was just set forth shall not apply to constitutional claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="202.256" offset="914432">Most of them apply to Federal medical workers, although not all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.914" offset="929061">There is 10 U.S.C. section 1089, the Gonzalez Act, which is discussed in our brief and in the government's brief, which applies to Army doctors.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.597" offset="963856">There are statutes applying to NASA doctors, to Veterans Administration doctors, to certain medical volunteers.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.593" offset="991754">So there are a number of these statutes passed over a period of several decades.</text>

            <text syncTime="226.058" offset="1009622">But it seems to me that, quite apart from the Westfall Act, there's a more -- more basic answer that you would make to Justice Sotomayor's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.211" offset="1046298">And that is, because the nature of immunity clauses are to make the employees secure against unforeseen causes of action as well as foreseen.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.804" offset="1084646">I think that's a principled answer you could make.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.552" offset="1095617">If I made that answer, do you have authority I could cite for that proposition?</text>

            <text syncTime="251.035" offset="1109514">--Well, I think that this Court has, you know, broadly speaking, in talking about judicially created immunities -- that immunity is for hard cases as well as easy cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.776" offset="1164476">And the Van de Kamp decision that this Court recently issued with respect to judicial immunity I think says--</text>

            <text syncTime="271.846" offset="1192793">But I think it's true, certainly, that -- it's true that Congress, when it passed section 233, didn't know for sure that there was going to be a Bivens cause of action that was going to be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.279" offset="1238559">But it spoke very broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.652" offset="1243993">It said</text>
            <text syncTime="285.104" offset="1245874">"any other civil action or proceeding. "</text>
            <text syncTime="286.727" offset="1252352">And when it did that, it surely meant civil actions or proceedings that were created by the courts at some later point in time as well as those that existed at the time.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="295.505" offset="1287461">If we limit it, then Congress would have to reenact a statute every time there was some new cause of action?</text>

            <text syncTime="301.902" offset="1313061">And I think the problem with the interpretation that makes the interpretation of the statute depend on the timing of the Bivens decision is pointed up by two different statutory provisions and the odd results that you would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.343" offset="1362798">One is that the Gonzalez Act, which I referred to earlier -- it's 10 U.S.C. section 1089 -- was enacted in 1976, it has immunity-conferring language that's extremely similar to the immunity-conferring language of section 233(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="327.600" offset="1415774">In fact, we know that when Congress enacted the Gonzalez Act, it looked at and thought about section 233(a), and yet if it mattered whether Bivens had yet been decided, the Gonzalez Act would bar Bivens claims, but 233(a) wouldn't, even though you can't make that kind of distinction based on their text.</text>

            <text syncTime="368.472" offset="1579301">And I think one thing that's important is that "subject matter" here clearly means the same set of facts or the same set of circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.675" offset="1608140">So that, it -- it's not the case that you only get immunity where your cause of action is somehow similar to the cause of action you have under the FTCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.606" offset="1639800">If you -- you get immunity if you have any claim against the individuals that comes out of the -- the same set of facts, even if it were true that there was some requirement of an FTCA remedy, which we don't believe there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.695" offset="1688179">And what's absolutely clear here as well is that Respondents do have an FTCA remedy against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.082" offset="1713779">They have brought an FTCA claim against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.019" offset="1725482">The United States has admitted liability on that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.064" offset="1737707">That's found at page 328 of the Joint Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.642" offset="1747947">And so the question now is, what damages will the Respondents recover from the United States?</text>
            <text syncTime="415.938" offset="1769159">And -- and in that setting, most certainly the claim against the individuals is barred by section 233(a).</text>

            <text syncTime="560.450" offset="2347196">But what is clear from Carlson is that the way that section 233(a) did arise in that case is that the Court used it as a specific example to contrast with the FTCA itself, and said that section 233 was a place where Congress had made known explicitly its intent that the FTCA be the exclusive remedy and that other remedies be precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.897" offset="2432982">That's the way that 233(a) was argued in the briefs in that case, and that's how the Court used it.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.955" offset="2453253">And that's obviously extremely supportive of the Petitioners' plea for immunity here.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.734" offset="2476345">This Court has already essentially recognized in Carlson, in reasoning in support of its holding, that that is the role that 233(a) plays, and the Court must have been talking about barring Bivens claims because that's what Carlson was about.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.325" offset="2518768">So that's the significance of 233(a) in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.822" offset="2536741">The Respondents also -- on a subject we haven't touched on yet, I think, look at the title of section 233(a) and some of its other subsections, and there I think it's clear that the title can't vary the clear statutory text in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.425" offset="2603092">Even if the title were relevant here, it talks about negligence and malpractice.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.236" offset="2626393">And we've cited in our reply brief, at pages 18 to 19, the authorities showing that when the statute was enacted in 1970, malpractice was thought to sweep very broadly to cover any bad acts, any malpractice, and so it doesn't operate -- the title here can't operate as a limitation on the scope of this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.648" offset="2704029">With respect to the history, the one other thing that I wanted to point out that I didn't get to in my answer before is another odd result that you would have, if you looked at when Bivens was decided and made that your deciding factor, is that the FTCA's judgment bar, at 28 U.S.C. section 2676, which was enacted in 1948, which says that when you take a claim against the United States under the FTCA all the way to judgment, you are barred from raising any other civil action or proceeding by reason of the same subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.917" offset="2829103">So very similar language to what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.090" offset="2837776">That wouldn't bar Bivens claims, even though every court of appeals to have looked at the issue has said that it does cover Bivens claims in a different sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="749.155" offset="3102030">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: By its plain terms, section 233(a) precludes any civil action against officers and employees of the Public Health Service arising out of performance of their medical duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.807" offset="3156679">Instead, it makes an action against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act the exclusive remedy for injury arising out of PHS-provided care.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.318" offset="3194713">Unlike the Westfall Act, section 233 contains no carve-out for constitutional claims, nor is there any textual basis for which to imply one.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.438" offset="3231180">Accordingly, this Court should reverse the Ninth Circuit's decision allowing Respondents' Bivens claims against the individual Petitioners on top of their FTCA claims against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.356" offset="3278827">Now, even assuming Congress did not specifically have Bivens claims in mind at the time that they enacted this statute, that's no reason to limit the plain terms of section 233(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="804.712" offset="3324280">First, Justice Kennedy, going to your question about whether there's authority for that proposition that when Congress doesn't specifically anticipate a certain set of facts yet the plain terms control, that that is the correct result, this Court has stated both in the RICO context as well as in other contexts that the fact that Congress doesn't specifically contemplate application of the statute to particular circumstances simply demonstrates the breadth of the statute and not any ambiguity.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.481" offset="3439323">Those statements are set forth on page 15 of our brief, Sedima, Yeskey, and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.435" offset="3459176">The second point I would make is the best indication of Congress's broad intent is simply the plain terms of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.070" offset="3489688">Congress could have enacted a statute that only provided immunity for, say, negligent performance of medical duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.957" offset="3517273">It included no such limitation in 233(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="856.114" offset="3529916">It could have made the FTCA remedy exclusive of, say, only common law causes of action or State law causes of action, or even existing causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.686" offset="3572130">It did not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.481" offset="3575369">It said it is the exclusive remedy for any other civil action by reason of the same subject matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="875.370" offset="3606925">Mr. Shah, is that -- is that the same -- in all the statutes that Carlson cites on page 20, when they say that Congress follows the practice of explicitly stating what it means to make the FTCA an exclusive remedy, there's this -- the Gonzalez Act and there's 233(a), and then there is the swine flu.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.765" offset="3732522">Are they all -- are all those provisions, provisions like 233(a), that say "any civil action"?</text>

            <text syncTime="926.302" offset="3810680">"exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding. "</text>
            <text syncTime="929.991" offset="3825413">For example, the Gonzalez Act, which is reproduced in the gray brief on page 1a of our -- of the government's appendix, it uses very similar language.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.375" offset="3858954">It says: The FTCA remedy shall be exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding by reason of the same subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.809" offset="3892705">That's identical language to that used in 233(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="949.683" offset="3904199">Now, there is a way in which 233(a) is even broader than any of those other statutes in its description of what type of performance of medical duties is covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.647" offset="3952055">There, there is no modifier of negligence or wrongful act or omission.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.003" offset="3969400">It simply says: Any performance of medical duties is covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.204" offset="3982252">In the Gonzalez Act, which we would submit has as quite broad language and should have the same effect, they at least have a qualifier of negligent or wrongful act or omission.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.184" offset="4018197">Not that that should create a change in result, but it just goes to show the incredibly broad language that Congress used to show -- that Congress used in 233(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="988.214" offset="4058321">And I think on the Gonzalez Act point -- and Justice Sotomayor, I think this goes to your question about whether there are other statutes -- even though that Congress may not have contemplated Bivens at the time, the Gonzalez Act was passed in 1976, 5 years after Bivens had decided, and yet Congress used the identical language or nearly identical language as present in 233(a) in enacting the Gonzalez Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.344" offset="4158840">Presumably, Congress was aware of the potential for Bivens liability at the time, yet they chose to use the same categorical text.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.213" offset="4186321">And in the legislative history of the Gonzalez Act, they say they used that text for the specific purpose of ensuring total financial immunity -- immunity from total financial liability for DOD and armed forces medical personnel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1589.470" offset="6463258">In the briefs, it wasn't raised arguing that 233(a) bars Bivens claims; the government didn't make that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.435" offset="6487186">And, in fact, it was raised in the Respondents' cert petition or brief in opposition for the proposition that -- that the language of that statute actually allowed a Bivens claim because it didn't preclude it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.491" offset="6547372">And in -- in response the government actually argued that because Bivens hadn't been decided in -- in 1970, that it could not have possibly preserved Bivens claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.272" offset="6586556">So it was actually the opposite issue that was -- that was addressed in Carlson--</text>

            <text syncTime="1625.002" offset="6605469">It's put on page 20, because one of the reasons why Carlson enables -- allows the Bivens Act is that it doesn't contain language and the -- and it -- it seems to me that this -- that this paragraph is contrasting statutes with Carlson, because in Carlson there is no -- there is no other statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1662.597" offset="6755830">--Justice Ginsburg, if I may reply, I believe that that's not the proper way to read that dicta for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.266" offset="6786445">First, I think Justice Stevens mentioned the Assistant Surgeon General of the United States was actually a defendant in the case, and so although this 233(a) immunity wasn't -- wasn't decided in Carlson, certainly the Court was aware that a -- that a Public Health Service defendant was in the case, and they wouldn't have permitted an action to move forward against that defendant had they believed that 233 barred Bivens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.708" offset="6876202">And, second, it -- it specially characterizes the explicit declaration as applying to malpractice, not Bivens claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.425" offset="6911101">And other -- for example, another statute in the category there was the Federal Drivers Act, and certainly it's hard to imagine how a Federal driver could be liable under -- under Bivens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.952" offset="6953211">And so I think a better reading of that dicta is that the Court is just saying: Here's an example; these statutes show that when Congress makes an explicit declaration, but the issue is explicit as to what?</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.228" offset="6994380">And it's clear I think from reading that dicta based on the existence of the Surgeon General in the case and the fact that the dicta was qualified, that it didn't apply to Bivens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.600" offset="7035862">But moving back to the Carlson test, 233 can't satisfy the test because Carlson never even -- or Congress never considered whether the FTCA was a substitute for Bivens in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.595" offset="7087794">And this point is underscored by the fact that the statute was enacted before Bivens and that the cause of action at issue here wasn't recognized until 10 years later in Carlson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.779" offset="7128545">And, second, when Congress did finally consider for the first time whether the FTCA was an adequate substitute for Bivens in 1988, it expressly preserved, rather than barred, Bivens claims in the Westfall Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.568" offset="7183715">And the Westfall Act was a comprehensive statute that was intended to provide an overhaul of personal immunity at the request of this Court in Westfall v. Erwin, and it applied to all Federal employees, including members of the Public Health Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.218" offset="7234288">And that was the holding of this Court in Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.418" offset="7243065">And Petitioners' reading here would actually require this Court to write in an implied exception to the Westfall Act that doesn't exist, that would exempt out Public Health Service personnel from the explicit carve-out of Bivens.</text>

            <text syncTime="2694.238" offset="10882341">And when Congress enacted the statute in 1970, Bivens didn't even exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.296" offset="10902612">And so, the protection that -- the -- the position that we are advocating protects doctors because the Westfall Act extends much broader immunity to common law torts, to any wrongful act or omission, not just actions performing medical functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.652" offset="10964052">And so, this is completely consistent with Congress's intent in 1970 when constitutional claims didn't even exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.649" offset="10999996">And so, when Congress looked at the issue, examined it and decided whether -- whether there's a difference between Bivens and the common law and whether the FTCA was adequate to substitute for Bivens, it made a decision to expressly preserve Bivens actions in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.357" offset="11058824">And even if, Your Honors, you believe that 233 bars Bivens claims here, you have to reconcile it with the Westfall Act, because the Westfall Act expressly preserves Bivens claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.168" offset="11098112">And it is a comprehensive statute; it is a later passed statute; and it is specific to the issue before the Court, which is can -- can a Bivens claim be brought against a Public Health Service doctor?</text>

            <text syncTime="2759.540" offset="11143565">The Westfall Act could be read to say we're now covering all these people who did not have, who were not sheltered by immunity before, but this amendment saves out Bivens claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.814" offset="11204692">One could read that as self-contained and not touching other statutes that existed independently before.</text>

            <text syncTime="2784.995" offset="11245443">Your Honor, I -- I -- I don't think that's a reasonable reading, because at the time of the Westfall Act's passage in 1988, no court had held that Bivens claims were barred by section 233 or any other pre-Act immunity statute like the Gonzalez Act or and the VA Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.195" offset="11310226">And the legislative history of the Westfall Act shows that, in 1988, Congress believed that the Westfall Act would simply extend the protections available to -- to government employees before Westfall v. Erwin, and that -- and that people would still be able to bring constitutional claims against members of the Federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.715" offset="11388280">And so, Congress had no reason in 1988 to go back and amend the -- the earlier passed 233, because there was no indication -- judicial construction or the legislative history -- that 233 ever barred Bivens claims in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.038" offset="11445541">And so, adopting the Petitioners' position in this case would -- would subvert congressional intent, because it would say that, you know, when Congress finally weighed all of the considerations in the case, decided whether Bivens and the FTCA were adequate, it decided to -- it decided to preserve Bivens claims rather than bar them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.778" offset="11548568">And -- and -- and so, accepting the Petitioners' position would just subvert that intent based on an Act that was passed prior to Bivens existing, prior to a constitutional cause of action being accepted for this type of action, and it -- and it would just be completely inconsistent with what Congress has -- has done to protect Federal employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="2904.963" offset="11725260">But if you look at -- at the appendix to our -- our brief from page 28 to 62, there's two pages in there, page 29 and page 55, that show that section (a) still has meaning, because there's a host of non-Federal employees, people that -- that are government contractors that provide services to free health clinics and the like that can be deemed employees of the Public Health Service and then take advantage of their immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.018" offset="11837482">But otherwise, they wouldn't be able to take advantage of the immunity under FTCA, because they aren't Federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.902" offset="11857021">So 233(a) still has work to do, even under our construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.917" offset="11877083">And so, surely, it would not protect Public Health Service employees any more because they have greater protections in the Westfall Act, and, again, the Petitioners' reading here would -- the only work it would have left to do would be to bar Bivens claims, but Bivens didn't even exist in 1970, when -- that the Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.255" offset="11946465">That doesn't -- that doesn't make much common sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.314" offset="11954719">And before I -- I conclude, I just want to speak for a moment about, you know, the importance of this case under the -- the Bivens jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.891" offset="12004979">I mean, the purpose of Bivens -- this Court has acknowledged recently in Meyer and Malesko is to provide deterrence to -- to Federal officers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3075.224" offset="12406324">Just two quick points, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.970" offset="12425341">One is that I think you can't read this Court's Bivens jurisprudence to set forth any kind of clear statement rule in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.876" offset="12452927">In many cases after Carlson was decided, this Court has looked for indications that Congress thought the judiciary should stay its hands, and it has found those indications in the mere existence of some kind of statutory scheme, even where Congress has said nothing express about whether that scheme should be exclusive or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.478" offset="12523353">If it can be the case that, simply by setting forth an elaborate scheme, Congress can indicate its intent that this particular implied cause of action shouldn't go forward, then it must be true also that where Congress expressly says that it shouldn't go forward, that that can be given effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.751" offset="12588450">And I point out that there is not a cutting off of a constitutional right here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.591" offset="12607781">It's just that there is a specific cause of action that isn't going to be allowed to go forward because it's one that this Court would imply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.150" offset="12634008">Secondly, just to go back to my answer to Justice Kennedy's question before, the case that I meant to cite to you was Van de Kamp v. Goldstein, 129 Supreme Court 855, and that talked about absolute immunity reflecting a balance of evils.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.751" offset="12696388">Here, I think Congress has done that balancing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.547" offset="12707568">Congress has decided that it would rather protect the PHS, make sure that causes of action and liability aren't hanging over the heads of PHS officers, even if that means that some individuals don't get recovery against certain specific PHS personnel on their claims, when they can of course recover from the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.789" offset="12780607">If there are no further questions, we'd ask that the decision of the Ninth Circuit be reversed.</text>
