            <text syncTime="1191.259" offset="4870416">And so Glucksberg has its discussion about the standard for unenumerated rights, but it starts that off by saying of course the Bill of Rights are different.</text>

            <text syncTime="1212.625" offset="4955888">--Again, though, it's interesting that the one place that I -- that I see where the Court has not effectively translated all the case law is one of the procedural rights, the Sixth Amendment criminal jury right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.776" offset="5000505">And I think with respect to the substantive rights -- and I think the alliance here or the similarity between the First and the Second Amendments are very stark in this respect -- this Court has incorporated essentially not just the amendment and not just the right, but all of the jurisprudence as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.459" offset="5059229">And, you know, I would -- just to dwell for a moment if I'd could on the -- on the First and the Second Amendment, I think it's striking, very striking, that if this Court's not going to reconsider its Privileges or Immunities Clause jurisprudence, the Cruikshank case actually stands as very good precedent for incorporating the Second Amendment, just as it was the precedent this Court relied on in incorporating the assembly and petition rights of the First Amendment in the De Jonge case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.277" offset="5154523">And the reason is Cruikshank -- the whole reason that Cruikshank said the First and Second Amendments aren't privileges of national citizenship is because they were preexisting rights that didn't depend on the Constitution for their existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.350" offset="5202798">That seems to me to be a pretty good working definition of what a fundamental right is, one that is so fundamental and basic that it preexisted our very Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.594" offset="5235816">And so it's not surprising that De Jonge cited Cruikshank as favorable precedent for incorporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.626" offset="5259954">I think the exact same logic would apply to the Second Amendment here, and, as I say, I do think the consequence of that, certainly the most logical consequence, would be to carry over the jurisprudence under the Second Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.712" offset="5304257">Now, right now, that's not carrying over a lot, right?</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.617" offset="5315856">That's carrying over the Heller case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.728" offset="5320349">But I think in a way that points up to the fact that one of the virtues of incorporation is that, because the Miller decision of this Court sowed confusion, we don't have substantial Second Amendment jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.099" offset="5365802">And I would think that it's going to be difficult enough to develop the Second Amendment jurisprudence that you wouldn't want to make it more difficult by having to develop a Federal Second Amendment jurisprudence and then some sort of shadow version of that jurisprudence for the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.715" offset="5424316">And I think in the more recent incorporation cases, this Court was quite candid that it wasn't going to adopt sort of a shadow version of the Federal guarantee or some watered-down version of the Federal guarantee, but it really saw the virtue of incorporating not just the right but the jurisprudence that came with that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.930" offset="5497145">And so I do think that's in a sense something that counts in favor of incorporating the Second Amendment and doing so through the Due Process Clause, the same way this Court has dealt with the other substantive guarantees of the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.999" offset="5545420">And I think if you apply that jurisprudence, the case really is very straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.844" offset="5560780">In fact, I think if you compare the First Amendment and the Fourth Amendment to the Second Amendment, they have the same textual guarantee to the people, they trace their origins to preexisting rights back to the English Bill of Rights, back to even earlier constitutional history.</text>

            <text syncTime="3133.931" offset="12641113">One is the analysis the Court used in Heller.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.947" offset="12649159">In Heller, what the Court said is: This is not the time to balance things; you cannot ban handguns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.583" offset="12671728">Now, there may be local -- there have been local jurisdictions before and there are now ones where they feel allowing some firearms, but banning handguns, is the best way to achieve public safety and to increase the zone of ordered liberty for their people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.547" offset="12723660">And those things would be apparently impermissible under Heller.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.262" offset="12742468">But even more than that, Heller construed the Second Amendment's "bear" -- the word "bear", "to keep and bear arms" -- to mean the same thing as "carry" in this Court's case in Muscarello, much later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.305" offset="12786667">And to carry -- generally to carry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.242" offset="12798370">Many -- there's a long history of regulation of not just concealed carry, as the Court did recognize in Heller, but of banning open carry in a variety of jurisdictions.</text>
