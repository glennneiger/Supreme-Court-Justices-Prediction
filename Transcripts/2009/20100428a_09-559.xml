            <text syncTime="3359.562" offset="13544720">Secondly, with respect to whether or not there's any conduct here, I don't think signing a written statement is conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.318" offset="13575753">And, of course, by signing the statement, the person is adopting the statement on the petition, one of which involves their preference on the referendum, and the second is the -- the request that the matter goes on the ballot.</text>
