            <text syncTime="281.494" offset="1231350">And Dellmuth v.

            <text syncTime="2092.989" offset="8477403">It did not apply to the head of state.</text>

            <text syncTime="2098.035" offset="8497570">So, if that was codified, that was a dramatic change done silently in the FSIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.048" offset="8521603">The reason Congress would want to retain Executive Branch role here is because the inquires are different, and the first one is the most elemental one in Petitioner's case and that is the assertion that: I was acting in my official capacity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2123.058" offset="8597671">If the FSIA eliminated the head of state's normal absolute immunity while sitting from all actions, commercial or not, that's a dramatic revolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.207" offset="8642288">We can now sue sitting prime ministers and presidents and distract them from their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.644" offset="8664022">If the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act made any official's official act an act of the state -- and remember, they are now every level of the foreign government down to the mayor's office, and corporate officials, too, so we've now eliminated the long-standing principle in corporate law -- corporations also only act through individuals -- that corporate liability and individual liability go hand-in-hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.964" offset="8761302">The -- the FSIA did not uproot all that, and it provides no mechanisms.</text>

            <text syncTime="2958.625" offset="11939882">Well, let me answer that in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.721" offset="11944270">First, there's -- there is a very practical distinction between suing the state and suing the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.106" offset="11965795">The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is not just about immunity; it's about the subject matter of the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.558" offset="11983663">If a foreign sovereign is found to be immune, the court has no jurisdiction over the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.119" offset="12005919">So to say that the individual is -- is governed by the FSIA means that it would be a threshold subject matter jurisdictional inquiry in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.554" offset="12039670">So in terms of judicial administration, that is a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.223" offset="12054298">It is also a problem, as a practical matter, to apply the FSIA's very reticulated standards that were carefully negotiated between the Executive Branch and Congress when they knew what they were dealing with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.673" offset="12100065">They were dealing with the immunity of states and the -- and the principals of states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.608" offset="12115843">And this is reflected, as Ms. Millett said, in section 1602.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.980" offset="12129322">That's the business that Congress wanted to get -- Congress and the Executive -- wanted the Executive to be out of, which was the immunity of foreign states--</text>
