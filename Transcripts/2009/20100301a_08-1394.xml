            <text syncTime="7.027" offset="134604">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The dramatic collapse of Enron had profound reverberations experienced throughout the Houston economy and citizenry.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.883" offset="170026">Countless individuals in the Houston area were affected, as the court of appeals explicitly recognized, so much so that 60 percent of the jury venire affirmatively acknowledged in the responses to questionnaires that they would be unable to set aside their deep-seated biases or doubted their ability to do so, or that they were angry about Enron's collapse, an anger that was manifested in the vitriolic terms in which Petitioner Jeff Skilling was referred to repeatedly both in the questionnaires and in the community more generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.045" offset="274620">The passions about this case were so intense and the connections to Enron ran so deep that the entire United States Attorney's Office, all 150 or so attorneys, recused themselves from the investigation that culminated in this prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.820" offset="325716">In those conditions, the court of appeals was correct in unanimously concluding that this was one of the very rare cases in which, because of the degree of passion and prejudice in the community, the process of voir dire cannot be relied upon to adequately ferret out and identify unduly biased jurors.</text>

            <text syncTime="120.788" offset="589552">The reason that trial counsel objected to six specific jurors at the juncture that Your Honor's referring to is that that corresponded to six cause objections that had been, in our view, erroneously denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.551" offset="628632">Now, that in no way suggests that we were satisfied with the remainder of the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="136.343" offset="651828">There was only one juror that had been challenged for cause against -- for which a preemptory challenge wasn't used.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.357" offset="683907">I thought that every other for-cause challenge ended up being excused on the basis of a preemptory challenge.</text>

            <text syncTime="174.453" offset="804279">There were six as -- there were six remaining as to which we didn't have a corresponding for-cause objection that had been denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.796" offset="833640">But in no way indicates that we were satisfied with the other six.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.138" offset="847015">From the very outset, we complained about this process.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.761" offset="861539">We said at the outset before trial that no juror could be seated in this case because the process of voir dire couldn't adequately be relied upon in these conditions.</text>

            <text syncTime="204.741" offset="925383">What else in the process was deficient?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Sri Srinivasan</label>
            <text syncTime="207.567" offset="936667">The process was deficient in a couple of respects, Your Honor: First, with respect to time and scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.829" offset="953804">The voir dire that the trial judge conducted was essentially an ordinary voir dire for ordinary circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.687" offset="985151">He announced before the fact that the voir dire would be conducted in a period of 1 day, and we objected to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.684" offset="1009183">He also announced that he would have limited questioning and that counsel would have very limited opportunity to follow up with additional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.353" offset="1035828">We also objected clearly and repeatedly to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.383" offset="1047949">And that was manifested in the voir dire that occurred, because what the trial judge did is made two fundamental, we think, mistakes in the way he conducted the voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.787" offset="1081595">One occurs with respect to those jurors as to whom they had laid bare their biases, and another occurs with respect to those jurors as to whom they didn't affirmatively acknowledge their biases, but, given the conditions that prevailed in the community, they might well have had biases that they didn't affirmatively acknowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.061" offset="1142721">Now, with respect to the first, the mistake that, in our view, the trial judge made was to accept a simple assurance of fairness in the face of overt statements of bias and in conditions that confronted this community, where there was deep-seated community prejudice and animus that permeated the Houston -- that permeated the city of Houston, that kind of acceptance of a simple assurance of fairness in the face of repeated overt statements of bias shouldn't be countenanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.363" offset="1247943">And we think what the trial court should have done in that situation is to move to an additional juror.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.750" offset="1265392">But instead of doing that, the trial court interviewed 46 jurors, nearly 8 more than the minimum that was necessary to constitute a jury in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.621" offset="1300919">And just to give this a frame of reference, the entire voir dire process in this case took 5 hours, and the trial judge interviewed each juror for approximately 4 and a half minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.684" offset="1337177">By way of comparison--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="308.947" offset="1342192">But he did -- he did give time for counsel to ask additional questions, trial counsel.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sri_srinivasan" startTime="316.130" stopTime="316.489">
            <label>Mr. Sri Srinivasan</label>

            <text syncTime="316.489" offset="1372390">He asked both sides if they had additional questions.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sri_srinivasan" startTime="320.895" stopTime="384.667">
            <label>Mr. Sri Srinivasan</label>
            <text syncTime="320.895" offset="1390049">He gave some time, Justice Ginsburg, but he made clear before the voir dire began that that opportunity was going to be limited both in time and scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.894" offset="1422023">With respect to scope -- and this is at page 11805 of the record -- what he said was that follow-up questioning would be permitted if it was reasonable and if it was related to the purposes for which the juror was brought before the bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.213" offset="1467267">And just to paint the picture a little bit, the -- the potential jurors were brought before the bench, and they were left standing, which I think reinforced the conception that this was going to be a rather quick affair and it was not going to allow the kind of extensive, meaningful follow-up that we thought was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.100" offset="1522855">And to give it a frame of reference, in the Oklahoma City bombing case, the prosecution of Timothy McVeigh, that proceeding was transferred from the city of Oklahoma City to Denver, but even after the transfer, the trial judge conducted an 18-day voir dire with an average of 1 hour of interviews per juror; 18 days and 1 hour as compared with 5 hours and 4 and a half minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.765" offset="1609477">And we think the Oklahoma City experience is much more befitting of the kind of voir dire that's necessary in circumstances of community prejudice and passion of the kind that existed here.</text>

            <text syncTime="428.491" offset="1820442">They -- they in fact talked about it in terms of the 9/11 attack.</text>

            <text syncTime="436.114" offset="1850849">There were a lot of people who indicated they really didn't know anything about this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="440.299" offset="1867672">That's true, Justice Ginsburg, but I'd like to clarify one aspect of that, if I could, and that's that our argument is not -- and it hasn't been at any point in this proceeding -- that pretrial publicity caused the passion and prejudice in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.015" offset="1910512">This is -- is very much a case in which pretrial publicity was a symptom rather than the cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.182" offset="1927126">Now, pretrial publicity, to be sure, stoked the passions that -- that already lay within the community, but really this was a case in which the passions existed regardless of pretrial publicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.354" offset="1963907">And I think the juror questionnaires and the surveys and all the other evidence that we put before the district court manifests that.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.741" offset="1989402">If you look at the juror questionnaires -- and they are -- there are several examples of situations in which particular jurors said that they were unaware of any of the pretrial publicity, they did not watch the news, they didn't read the newspapers, they hadn't seen the movies about Enron, but yet they still said they had feelings about Jeff Skilling and Ken Lay.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.779" offset="2057529">Juror 63, a person who wound up on the panel, is a good example of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.701" offset="2073203">She answered "no" to all the questions concerning her exposure to pretrial publicity, but then when she was asked whether she had views about the guilt or innocence of Jeff Skilling, she said yes, she did; and she elaborated on that by explaining that I think he probably knew he was breaking the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="542.617" offset="2276958">Now, our first order of submission is that the proceedings should have been transferred, not necessarily because there don't in fact exist or there didn't in fact exist 12 unbiased jurors in the city of Houston.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.393" offset="2316037">Our point is a different one, and that is that in conditions where you have the level of passion and prejudice that permeated the Houston community, there's too great a risk that the process of voir dire and particularly the ordinary process of voir dire wouldn't be successful in identifying those 12 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.576" offset="2372775">That's the danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.793" offset="2377582">And the other problem with the argument that the government makes with respect to the fact that there are 4 and a half million citizens in Houston, which I think is part of Your Honor's question, is that that would mean more if the trial judge had gone deeper into the jury pool than the mere 46 jurors he did interview.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.663" offset="2433066">Because when he interviewed those 46 and stopped at that point, what we were left with was a jury panel as to which there was too great a danger of bias, too great a danger that they would bring their biases to bear with them in adjudicating Petitioner's guilt.</text>

            <text syncTime="665.063" offset="2766702">There's two in particular: First, in a community like Houston, in the state of the -- the passion and prejudice that existed in Houston at the time of this trial, there's a real concern that jurors will not feel fully free to return to that community delivering anything other than the conviction for which the -- the community desires.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.664" offset="2837128">And that, I think, is an important concern that this Court's decisions identify.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.738" offset="2849353">And the other one, and this is in Murphy in particular, where there's a substantial share of the community that's impassioned and prejudiced, as this one was, there's a concern that even jurors who don't lay bare -- who don't affirmatively acknowledge their biases -- are unwittingly subject to the same biases that permeate the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.920" offset="2914137">And that sort of danger is -- is the reason that in these situations, we think transfer is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.619" offset="2940886">But even if transfer wasn't required, what needed to happen was a more extensive and intensive voir dire than happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.648" offset="2965023">The voir dire was deficient -- and Justice Ginsburg, this gets back to your question about juror 63.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.928" offset="2986130">The voir dire was deficient in at least this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.225" offset="2995325">In conditions like those that permeated Houston, we think it's error to accept the assurance of fairness of a juror who has already laid bare their biases.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.188" offset="3035240">Now, juror 63, for example, she said she thinks she knew that Jeff Skilling -- she thinks that Jeff Skilling knew he was breaking the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="756.494" offset="3132416">And then we did challenge -- as Justice Sotomayor's question about the six specific challenges that we lodged at the close of the voir dire, but before the jurors were sworn -- juror 63 was one of those jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.176" offset="3171182">And so I think it was evident that juror 63 was not at all somebody who we were satisfied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.236" offset="3187378">And the reason is, if you look at the nature of -- at the voir dire colloquy with her, the trial court asked her about that statement and asked her: You remember making this statement?</text>
            <text syncTime="779.481" offset="3224367">Do you still feel that way?</text>
            <text syncTime="780.983" offset="3230427">And her response was: I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.870" offset="3237951">And then she acknowledged: I have no further information to bring to bear on that question than I did then.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.961" offset="3262297">And at that point, she has only fortified the bias that she brought with her, but the trial court was unsatisfied, and he continued to press.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.586" offset="3288837">And then he asked her at some point: Can you apply the presumption of innocence?</text>
            <text syncTime="799.615" offset="3304929">And she said yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.566" offset="3308690">And then that was it.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.443" offset="3312243">But in our view, a -- a search for a -- what I think can fairly be described as a rote assurance of fairness can't be sufficient, given the very evident danger that someone like juror 63, who has already laid bare her biases, would bring her biases with her to the panel when she adjudicated Petitioner's guilt or innocence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1499.713" offset="6105255">For example, suppose that there is an employer policy that says you can only use workplace computers for business purposes, and when asked, the employee says that he is only using it for business purposes, but he is in fact using it for personal reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.971" offset="6158336">Well, at that point he will have made a deception to the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.236" offset="6167427">Arguably, it would be material, particularly given that it acts in the face of an employer policy, and it arguably was made in furtherance of the employer's personal interest in maximizing his compensation at the expense of the -- at the expense of the employer's interests in having better information with which to make an informed decision about the employee's future.</text>

            <text syncTime="1677.171" offset="6815159">The judge said: I will not challenge her for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.435" offset="6828220">I counted another, juror -- what's this one -- juror number -- number's 74, who when he looked her square in the eye and said, "Can you be fair"?</text>

            <text syncTime="1693.959" offset="6882241">So, in my own subjective account, there were five here, maybe six, certainly three, that perhaps if they'd had an appeal on peremptories, which apparently they don't, they might have said these should have been challenged for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.389" offset="6935949">So I'm concerned about the 5 hours, about the lack of excusal for cause, about the very, very brief questions that he provided to people who had said on the questionnaire they could be -- they could be biased.</text>

            <text syncTime="3349.678" offset="13505118">And then continued:</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.801" offset="13509611">"When an investor buys a share of stock, an investor buys some rights in a publicly traded company. "</text>

            <label>Mr. Sri Srinivasan</label>
            <text syncTime="3385.600" offset="13648896">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.678" offset="13657151">A couple of quick points on the honest services fraud issue, and then a couple of points on the juror issue, if I might.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.673" offset="13677108">With respect to honest services fraud, first of all, I think that the government pointed to the jury instruction -- and, Justice Ginsburg, this goes to some questions that you had raised -- I think what's clear from the capacious nature of the jury instruction that was issued in this case is that the elements that the government say make Jeff Skilling guilty of honest services fraud weren't put before the jury or required to be found by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.225" offset="13763312">And for that reason alone, the conviction against Jeff Skilling ought to be overturned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.899" offset="13778045">Another point I'd make very quickly with respect to the sweep of the government's theory concerning the workplace is, under our understanding, the duty of loyalty does extend to all employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.176" offset="13815139">It does, and, therefore, the theory that they assert should apply in this case, I think, has devastating implications for workplace relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.469" offset="13844292">Now, with respect to the juror question, a couple of preliminary points, and then I'd like to walk the Court through just one aspect of the voir dire which I think exhibits the manifest flaws in the process the trial court conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.698" offset="13889223">With respect to the question about the issuance of questionnaires, questionnaires were also issued in the Timothy McVeigh case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.211" offset="13915240">But I don't want to limit our comparison to Timothy McVeigh, because I think in response to some of the questions that were raised, I don't want to leave an impression that a multiple-day voir dire with the sort of extensive questioning that we think was required here is not in use in other cases that involve like crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.568" offset="13976680">In the Martha Stewart case, for example, which was a financial case, there were 6 days of voir dire and after a questionnaire was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.454" offset="14004266">And in that case, the only reason you needed an extended voir dire was because of the celebrity status of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.218" offset="14027358">You didn't have the deep-seated community passion and prejudice that characterized the Houston venue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.637" offset="14048987">So, I think it's not at all unusual to have that kind of extended voir dire, and, in fact, we would say it's absolutely necessary to assure that the defendant receives the fair and impartial jury to which he's entitled.</text>

            <text syncTime="3542.999" offset="14278447">And I think the way the trial court conducted the voir dire in this case exhibits the manifest flaws in his approach generally.</text>
