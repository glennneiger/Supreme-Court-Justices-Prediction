            <text syncTime="7.287" offset="134520">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Federal Circuit's rigid and narrow machine-or-transformation test for all patent-eligible methods should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.795" offset="180600">The requirement that any and all methods must be either tied to a particular machine or transform specific subject matter doesn't find any basis in either the language of section 101 or anywhere in the patent statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.721" offset="240264">It's not required by this Court's precedence, and it's contrary to the established principle that section 101 should be read broadly to accommodate unforeseen advances in the useful arts.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.529" offset="287493">There are recognized exclusions from section 101, from that broad language, such as laws of nature, natural phenomenon, and abstract ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.551" offset="327617">Those may not be patented.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.003" offset="333469">But these exceptions, which are drawn from the Court's precedent, including this Court's Diehr case, also find support in the statutory language, which says that any process must be new and useful.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.910" offset="385087">So the prohibition against patenting laws of nature or abstract principles -- it applies equally to all four categories of subject matter under 101, but, here, the Federal circuit has created a new test just for processes that are not found in the statute or required by this Court's decisions--</text>

            <text syncTime="118.407" offset="579020">What's wrong with that analysis, that that's what "useful arts" meant, that it always -- always was thought to deal with machines and inventions?</text>

            <text syncTime="146.160" offset="690092">I'll admit that during the Industrial Revolution most of the inventions concerned machines and manufacturing processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.914" offset="721126">But we have cited counter-examples that show that business was also within the useful arts.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.753" offset="748398">It's also up to Congress to decide how to implement the patent system and the statutory scheme--</text>

            <text syncTime="172.061" offset="793642">But if it covers everything under the sun, I've never seen a case where Congress would take something out.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.680" offset="816107">Now, if we are relying on Congress, I guess the circuit would say, let's go narrow, and we won't have -- you know -- since you referred to Congress, I thought I would bring that up and see what you think.</text>

            <text syncTime="193.807" offset="880682">One of them is in section 273, to provide prior user rights for business methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.561" offset="903670">Another area is 287(c), where medical activities are also exempted from remedies under the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="221.209" offset="990292">So an estate plan, tax avoidance, how to resist a corporate takeover, how to choose a jury, all of those are patentable?</text>

            <text syncTime="252.994" offset="1117351">His firm wouldn't be successful if he didn't have anything that others didn't have.</text>

            <text syncTime="1565.232" offset="6366396">I think at a certain level of generality you could describe both Dale Carnegie and Alexander Graham Bell as people who devised methods of communicating more effectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.254" offset="6406416">The reason that Bell's method was patentable was that it operated in the realm of the physical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.325" offset="6426687">Bell had devised a process implemented through machines by which sound was transformed into electronic current.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.847" offset="6460855">Current was then transmitted over a distance and transformed back into sound.</text>

            <text syncTime="1649.214" offset="6702226">First, we would fairly vigorously resist the notion that the rule that was announced by the Federal Circuit is rigid or inflexible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.086" offset="6741723">That is, all that the Federal Circuit has really said is that to have a patent-eligible process you have to identify some link to a machine or a transformation of matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.776" offset="6780489">And the Federal Circuit has said with respect to some processes the link to the machine may be so attenuated, the machine part of the process may be such a small segment of the process as a whole, that this wouldn't be enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.185" offset="6834197">But the Federal Circuit said: We leave for another day the hard questions that will arise when part of the process is machine-implemented and another part is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.605" offset="6867843">And in order for the PTO and the Federal Circuit to go about the business of devising more precise rules as to when particular links to machines are sufficient to create patent eligibility, we first need to establish the -- the basic principle that some link to a machine or transformation is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.019" offset="6949449">So I think we -- we have made the alternative argument in our brief, and I think it is a basis for affirmance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.172" offset="6974109">But if the Court decided the case on that basis, we would lose at least the -- the limited clarity that the Federal Circuit's opinion has provided; that is, it would still be open to people in the future to devise new contractual arrangements designed to allocate risks, new methods of teaching antitrust, and--</text>

            <text syncTime="1965.872" offset="7968956">The first thing is that in Diehr when you had the e.g.&gt; ["] cite, it was</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.841" offset="7984734">"e.g., transforming an article into a different. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.591" offset="7995810">state of -- state or thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.876" offset="8000930">And I think the obvious inference is e.g.&gt; ["] was used because the other prong of the machine-or-transformation test is use as a machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.482" offset="8035307">That is, in the context of Mr. Morse's invention or Mr. Bell's invention, there is transformation of a sort, but it wouldn't naturally be characterized as transformation of matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.158" offset="8094030">Those things were held to be patent eligible not because they transformed matter, but because they involved the use of a machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.895" offset="8120989">And so, what the Court in Diehr said transformation of a matter or an article into a different state or thing is the clue to the patentability of a process that doesn't involve a particular machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.417" offset="8167069">And the -- the type of process it had in mind was the process that was described in Corning v. Burden or the process in Cochrane v. Deener, situations in which an individual had devised a method of, in one sense -- one case, it was manufacturing flour, and in another case it was rolling puddle balls, of manufacturing items.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.764" offset="8248466">And that person said, here is the series of steps that you have to go through, but it's not essential that you use any particular tool or machine for each of these steps.</text>

            <text syncTime="2148.678" offset="8700176">That is, the Federal Circuit has said since this particular patent applicant didn't identify any machine or any transformation that would be necessary to the accomplishment of its method, that person is out of luck, and, therefore, it's inappropriate for us to go on to decide kind of the precise level of substantiality that a machine or transformation must play--</text>

            <text syncTime="2983.676" offset="12040088">We didn't think the Court would mess it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.342" offset="12050745">We thought that this case would provide an unsuitable vehicle for resolving the hard questions because the case doesn't involve computer software or medical diagnostic techniques, and therefore, we thought the Court would arrive at the position that I think at least some members are feeling that you have arrived at, that you will decide this case, and most of the hard questions remain unresolved.</text>

            <text syncTime="3038.974" offset="12261292">--And we would -- we would be entirely content with a ruling like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.807" offset="12272682">And we would say that the claimed hedging method here is not the sort of Space Age innovation that might cause Justices to say: This is just different in kind from anything that the drafters of the patent statute could have imagined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.685" offset="12332136">The other point I would make about the programmed computer is, to follow up on my television and DVD example, that when you claim a machine or a manufacture, as the committee reports to the 1952 Act said, those words are broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.909" offset="12389083">They encompass everything under the sun that is made by man.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.295" offset="12402563">And so a television is indisputably a machine, even though its function is not to transform matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.633" offset="12427954">It's only when you get to the term "process" that you are left with -- that the machine-or-transformation test kicks in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.970" offset="12461286">And really, the argument on the other side is: The term "process" in ordinary speech is extremely broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.774" offset="12484483">It can literally be read to encompass any series of steps, whether or not linked to technology, whether or not linked to a machine or transformation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.564" offset="12519696">And the other side argues you should construe it that way in the patent statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.534" offset="12535578">I guess the -- the three reasons we would say that's not so are, first, under the canon of noscitur a sociis, it's appropriate to construe the term "process" in conjunction with the other terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.407" offset="12579046">Those other terms are broad, but they all refer to physical objects that don't exist in nature and are created by man.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.162" offset="12610079">And a huge array of very productive, innovative activity doesn't culminate in the creation of any new physical substance, and the word "process" surely was intended to add something, but it would be quite strange to construe the word "process" to encompass the whole range of human endeavor when the other words are limited to the creation of new things in the physical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.945" offset="12705165">The second thing is that when this Court in the past has explained the term "process", it's always linked it to the operation of machines, as in the telephone cases and in Morse, or to the transformation of matter in ways that may not be dependent on a particular machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.220" offset="12766292">And the third thing I would say is that in a sense, there's a strong</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.489" offset="12779353">"dog that didn't bark in the night. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.458" offset="12787294">quality to our argument; that is, even though the Court has never said in so many words that a method of allocating risk by contract is a patent-eligible process, the economic history of this country really would have been fundamentally different if it had been believed from the outset that innovations of this character could be patented and potential competitors could be foreclosed from engaging in the same method.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.842" offset="12888754">If the Court has nothing further?</text>

            <text syncTime="3204.947" offset="12925221">The Federal Circuit did announce this test as the sole test for all processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.035" offset="12953537">It said it applied no matter what the process was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.153" offset="12966076">So we do have to face these difficult questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.605" offset="12975794">I think the question can be avoided, because we don't need a rigid test of this type based on machine or transformation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.945" offset="13005155">The question we're looking at and should be looking at is: Are we trying to patent an abstract idea?</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.265" offset="13030442">Now, the government has gone farther than that and really wants to exclude methods of organizing human behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.835" offset="13056773">I think that's the way they describe it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.185" offset="13062207">That's really the business method rejection in other words.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.156" offset="13078089">And I think that runs contrary to section 273 of the statute, which recognized that there were business methods that could fall within the patent statute, and as a result, prior user rights should be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.630" offset="13127931">To speak briefly about the State Street Bank case, that was a type of business method that was implemented on a machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.450" offset="13155203">The Federal Circuit said it didn't matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.986" offset="13165338">They weren't looking at whether it was in machine form or method form.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.771" offset="13180489">Their reasoning would have applied the same either way, and to do otherwise would be to place form over substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.608" offset="13203895">And in a sense, that's what some of the transformation debate is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.127" offset="13217896">It's form over substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.579" offset="13223748">Why should transformation be the key?</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.798" offset="13236600">The key should be: Is it a practical application of a useful result?</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.083" offset="13253736">Our method, we believe, is a practical application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.720" offset="13272336">As the Patent Office has said, it does involve physical steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.171" offset="13286128">I think that was one of the clues that the patent office has relied on in saying whether or not something is abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.092" offset="13309743">Since it is not an abstract method, it's rooted in the real world, we think it should be eligible to have its examination at the Patent Office and it shouldn't be thrown out on an arbitrary test.</text>
