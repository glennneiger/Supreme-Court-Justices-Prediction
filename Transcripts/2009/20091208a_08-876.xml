            <label>Mr. Miguel A. Estrada</label>
            <text syncTime="9.606" offset="144844">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.308" offset="155711">For two decades, courts of appeals confronting Section 1346 have been unanimous on, at most, three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.663" offset="189147">The first one is that the unvarnished text of the statute is vague, amorphous, open-ended, and essentially, not very helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.369" offset="227913">The second one is that a meaningful attempt to construe the statute can take place, if at all, only in light of a body of law that this Court rejected in McNally and Congress likely intended to restore in the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.397" offset="296040">And the third is that this exercise is fraught with due process and federalism problems and risks the creation of common law crimes, especially in the private sector where the pre-McNally precedent was not well-developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.823" offset="357689">The principal question in this case is whether a prosecution may be sustained under a 1346 theory, under a theory that was not successful before McNally and, in fact, had been affirmatively rejected, even in the heyday of the intangible rights doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.404" offset="444103">Because the answer to that question is "no", all convictions in this case must be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.391" offset="468031">It would be well to start by acknowledging that the root difficulty in this case is that this Court asked Congress to speak clearly, and Congress did not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.317" offset="519753">As a result, there is no solution that is really capable of providing an -- an elegant out to the morass that the lower courts have been confronting, but the choices, essentially, fall on three categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.160" offset="579103">And the first is to return the matter to Congress, either because the statute is vague in all of its applications, both public or private, or as to private conduct, because there are not enough guideposts for judicial decision-making to give meaning to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.055" offset="654649">The second category of choices--</text>

            <text syncTime="141.859" offset="673876">I mean, we -- we have -- we have written a question that necessarily has that as a predicate, which, under this Court's cases, leave that predicate open to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.100" offset="726852">We have an--</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="155.916" offset="730091">Are -- are you saying that unless we adopt the limiting instruction that you propose, the statute is then vague?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="162.522" stopTime="230.416">
            <label>Mr. Miguel A. Estrada</label>
            <text syncTime="162.522" offset="756527">--We have argued that.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.189" offset="763214">It is also -- you know, just to -- just to finish painting the picture, Justice Kennedy, we have -- we have the trunk of a tree, and that's -- you know, the statute, is it vague or isn't?</text>
            <text syncTime="174.914" offset="806055">Then we have the question of whether there is a limiting construction, and Professor Altshuler, for example, has made a case that limiting the statute to bribes and kickbacks is a possibility, as that being, arguably, the only core conduct that Congress could have contemplated.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.439" offset="872197">And -- and the third one is to go beyond bribes and -- and kickbacks, and to expand the statute to what Congress likes to call self-dealing or non-disclosure, which is really a wholesale takeover of State commercial law.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.449" offset="932279">In our view, if the Court is disposed to reach that far into the third category, it is essential that the restrictions that had been recognized before McNally be enforced against -- against the government, but we have briefed the case in the way we have to this -- basically assuming that this tree is not imaginary and actually exists--</text>

            <text syncTime="230.416" offset="1028096">Your theory -- your theory that return to the pre-McNally cases would help you is based almost entirely on the D.C. Circuit case -- case in Lemire -- Lemire.</text>

            <text syncTime="244.658" offset="1085043">I think the D.C. Circuit's opinion, of course, is indeed very helpful, but it was a -- a distillation of what other courts of appeals have told the government again and again, in Ballard in the Fifth Circuit, in Feldman in the Seventh, in--</text>

            <text syncTime="262.870" offset="1157872">--Well, it had a different view, as we have pointed out, when they filed the brief in the Carpenter case.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.939" offset="1186189">But the fact is, whether it is or it isn't can be judged by what the contemporaneous cases were.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.777" offset="1213565">And Von Barta, Dixon, all cases in the Second Circuit, Feldman in the Seventh, Ballard, all had indicated that this was a requirement of the theory in intangible rights cases.</text>

          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="291.703" stopTime="302.761">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="291.703" offset="1273229">Well, since the -- since the body of pre-McNally lower court cases was hardly completely consistent, do you think this is a workable approach?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="302.761" stopTime="367.270">
            <label>Mr. Miguel A. Estrada</label>
            <text syncTime="302.761" offset="1317533">The honest answer is: I do believe that the statute is vague in all of its -- all of its applications, and I am happy to explain, quickly, because of that, why that is.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.052" offset="1362672">Obviously, there are obvious problems of notice with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.170" offset="1379077">The more fundamental problem with the statute, as if the notice problems were not enough, is in the second prong of the vagueness doctrine, which is the conferral of discretion to select the defendant on the government, and in particular, the prosecutors.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.982" offset="1450339">And this is a situation not unlike that as was outlined by Justice Breyer's concurring opinion in the Morales case.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.774" offset="1489523">And what he pointed out, pointing to cases like Coates v. City of Cincinnati, was that a statute that essentially confers discretion on the -- on the police and the prosecutors to select the quarry and come up with that appropriate justification to sell to the Court later--</text>

            <text syncTime="367.270" offset="1575518">I don't know what's so discretionary and harmful about a bribery or kickback case.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.709" offset="1609268">Let's take just the limiting principle of the trunk.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.744" offset="1621389">Whether it's in the private or the public sector, why would, offering, there be any discretion or any sense of vagueness about saying: It's illegal to give a bribery?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="391.969" stopTime="392.735">

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="392.735" offset="1677396">To get a contract, to pass legislation, it's illegal to take a kickback.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.205" offset="1699234">There is nothing seemingly vague about that or seemingly troublesome about prosecutorial discretion in those -- at least those two situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.411" offset="1736119">We could then go to the self-dealing question.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="410.280" stopTime="426.408">
            <label>Mr. Miguel A. Estrada</label>
            <text syncTime="410.280" offset="1747613">--I absolutely agree with the statements that you made, Justice Sotomayor.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.517" offset="1768511">It is undoubtedly true that a -- that a statute that proscribes bribery or kickbacks can constitutionally be written, if that is what the statute says.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="426.408" stopTime="474.456">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="426.408" offset="1812083">But it's not your -- it's not within your test, as I understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.177" offset="1827129">Your test is, there has to be economic harm to the person owed the duty of loyalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.532" offset="1860566">Now, you could have a bribe or a kickback that will line the pockets of the person who takes it, doesn't deceive the person who is giving it, and doesn't harm the company to whom a duty of loyalty is owed.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.244" offset="1931410">So it seems to me that the bribe and kickback, which I think is heartland McNally, would not be included in yours.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.200" offset="1971221">It must be economic harm, actual or contemplated, to the person owed the duty of loyalty.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="474.456" stopTime="515.283">
            <label>Mr. Miguel A. Estrada</label>
            <text syncTime="474.456" offset="2004240">I think that is not a fair statement, Justice Ginsburg, because in our economic system, I think it is fairly inferable, and any jury could so find that if you are a supply agent for a corporation and you are taking a bribe of $10,000 to steer the contract to Company X, Company X would be more than happy, and it would be a matter of indifference to Company X to just give a 10K break to your employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.189" offset="2111237">So it is inherent in the economic system in the private sector that if you're talking about bribes and kickbacks, there is an obvious, though perhaps not fully quantifiable, risk of loss to the person to whom the duty is owed.</text>

City of Cincinnati where the law basically said,</text>

            <text syncTime="563.013" offset="2358460">Now, as Justice Breyer pointed out, many of us would agree 100 out of 100 that certain things are definitely annoying.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.119" offset="2394927">And the fact that you could find, for example, that an assault is annoying does not mean that this statute gives notice that -- that, you know, your conduct is -- is within its written terms--</text>

            <text syncTime="774.127" offset="3202947">I mean, to be sure, it does -- it does make this a kind of fraud, and in the past, fraud did require injury to somebody.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.499" offset="3244429">But it defined a new kind of fraud, namely, fraud that consists of the deprivation of honest services.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.057" offset="3286643">That's the fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.357" offset="3291867">That, in and of itself, under the text of the statute, I take to be the fraud.</text>

            <label>Mr. Miguel A. Estrada</label>
            <text syncTime="802.045" offset="3314646">Your Honor, I don't think that I can give an answer that would be fully satisfactory to a pure textualist, that this can be taken out of the words of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.537" offset="3364592">As a practical matter, however, if you consider the legislative record, and the avowing hint to restore some part of what McNally had thrown out, then a harder question comes up, and the issue of what that was actually becomes highly relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.064" offset="3434705">But I do not think that, even under the textualist view, it is fair to say that Congress went in the private sector from a view of fraud that is -- that was classically property kind to a view of fraud that has nothing to do with property.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.257" offset="3499489">And the reason for that takes understanding what -- what the problem really was that Congress was trying to fix, and that the intangible rights cases were trying to fix.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.214" offset="3547345">And it's really one of symmetry.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.333" offset="3555809">It has always been the case that mail fraud is a specific intent crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.570" offset="3576707">And it has always been the case, and this is clearly stated in cases like Regent Office Supply and Dixon, from Judge Friendly, that a part of the specific intent to defraud is an intent to harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.211" offset="3627280">Now, in classic fraud, the defendant intends to harm the victim by obtaining, in a corrupt manner, his property.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.733" offset="3669389">So there is a perfect symmetry between the intended harm to the victim and the expected gain of the defendant, because the gain comes from the victim's pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.040" offset="3710558">The problem of bribes and kickbacks that the intangible rights cases were trying to deal with is not that they were trying to dispense with the harm's requirement to the victim; they were trying to deal with the lack of symmetry where the person given the payoff is not deceived and the harm to the victim is non-quantifiable.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.108" offset="3818914">And to fix that problem, you could say that this statute could then say that the term of art, as the government calls it, that Congress used was intended to cover that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.000" offset="3866457">Now, the proof in the pudding on that comes from a very well-known case.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.701" offset="3885265">Let's take, you know, the Holzer case, which was cited extensively by Justice Stevens in his dissent in McNally.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.390" offset="3912014">You may recall it was a State court judge who had been taking bribes, and his conviction was affirmed in an opinion by Judge Posner, which he cited in this case again, which appears, I think, at 816 F. 2d, and it was just a straight intangible rights affirmment.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.935" offset="3982232">He sought cert, you know, Judge Holzer did, and he got a GVR in light of McNally.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.256" offset="4011489">And Judge Posner got the case back.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.558" offset="4024654">Judge Holzer goes back and there is a second opinion, 840 F. 2d, and Judge Posner has to conclude that Judge Holzer has to be let go on the mail fraud counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.765" offset="4069480">And the reason he gives is: Look, the judge obviously got lots of money, but he didn't get the money from anybody who was deceived, and all of his victims, which were the public and the litigants against whom the cases were fixed, those people didn't lose any money, so that under the McNally paradigm, because the money that Judge Holzer got in bribes did not come from the victims, that -- that judge had to be let go.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.433" offset="4180135">And I think that that's part of what Congress clearly had in mind as was trying to fix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.236" offset="4203436">Now, I agree with your -- with your apparent antecedent view and what I call issue one in the case, that the way that Congress did it has been one of not complying with the request that this Court made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.531" offset="4268534">It did not make anything clear in a way that sets forth in the text what it does.</text>

            <text syncTime="1067.181" offset="4375218">That is actually the tip of the iceberg, because if you look as a textual matter to the first words of Section 1346, you will see that this new amended definition of 63 of Title 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.374" offset="4443972">There are 11 of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.076" offset="4450764">And in addition to mail and wire fraud, at least three of them -- bank fraud, securities fraud, and healthcare fraud -- used the phrase "scheme to defraud".</text>

Private distinction, Justice Kennedy, because I think it is important, in trying to figure out how one goes about trying to fix what is basically a mess, you have to keep in mind that the courts had accepted the intangible rights theory before McNally, and which Congress presumably and -- or likely was trying to bring back, had -- had not taken the view that they were doing something other than fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.220" offset="5479361">But they have taken the view that there was a basis in the concept of fraud for distinguishing between the public and the private, even before McNally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.724" offset="5513320">And some of this -- this is found in the briefing in McNally and is set forth in Justice Stevens's dissenting opinion, that there was this other statute, Section 371 of 18 U.S.C., the conspiracy statute, that uses the phrase</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.936" offset="5582179">"conspiracy to defraud the United States. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.204" offset="5591270">And on the basis of that statute, before McNally, the courts of appeals have -- have ruled that an intent to interfere with the property rights of the government was not an element of the core meaning of the fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.980" offset="5654382">And the reason for that was that since 1905, in a case called Hask v.

            <text syncTime="3453.559" offset="13920674">Just a few points, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.742" offset="13929451">First, it bear emphasis that the government has once again said that this is a federal obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.997" offset="13954424">This entire case was tried based on Talmudic debates of the ins and outs of Section 144 of the Delaware law of corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.953" offset="13994235">We had motions to dismiss, we had briefing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.055" offset="14002698">The jury was given detailed instructions, and this goes to all of the fraud counts, Justice Alito.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.709" offset="14025268">You cannot say that you can uphold something as harmless when the entire theory on which the case was tried actually has been changed at the Supreme Court of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.915" offset="14070094">Relatedly, I would like to add, because the government said that count seven was a theft, that the government's theory on count seven was that the noncompetes were frauds from their inception, because the reps from Paxton and Forum, none was wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.793" offset="14145640">And in fact, other counts that charged Forum and Paxton, two and three, you know, the jury returned a verdict of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.648" offset="14181063">And as did Judge Sansieve on Kipnis on seven.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.434" offset="14196214">And that makes it highly likely that -- that the jury convicted based on the government 's argument, that even though every single member of the audit committee approved the noncompetes as a member of the board, that Delaware law required a separate and prior application to the audit committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.579" offset="14268729">And if that's what the jury was told, you cannot really say that count seven is separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.466" offset="14288269">Second--</text>

            <text syncTime="3554.605" offset="14324840">The jury was told -- let me find that, I think it's around page 336.</text>

            <text syncTime="3565.213" offset="14367263">Yeah, 336 and 337, and the jury was given detailed instructions as to how all this turned on whether the transactions at issue were, quote, entirely fair under Delaware law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3578.437" offset="14420240">But it said honest services include fiduciary duties under corporate.</text>

            <label>Mr. Miguel A. Estrada</label>
            <text syncTime="3582.555" offset="14436645">--Correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.922" offset="14438107">And then you then went to say that -- that, you know, Delaware was controlling -- this is the middle of page 336 A -- under Delaware law, a corporation's officers have these duties, one of them is loyalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.830" offset="14489725">Loyalty requires this and such under Delaware law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.115" offset="14502891">One of the things that -- that would allow the jury to convict was the notion that the government in entirely just has odds for understandable reasons, but this was not entirely fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.637" offset="14541030">And a transaction could fail to be entirely fair if every disclosure that should have been made in accordance with Delaware law was not made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.393" offset="14576034">On the second point that I wanted to make is the question of whether we are really embarking on the federal common law of materiality.</text>

            <text syncTime="3629.351" offset="14623890">The second question I wanted to address is a question that you raised, Justice Sotomayor, it is false to say that the materiality is a filter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.890" offset="14657954">Criminal law, just as a question of doctrine, has always looked at the mens rea, as the filter that takes out the culpable from the nonculpable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.662" offset="14689092">In this case, you know, the so-called filter is elusory.</text>

            <text syncTime="3659.903" offset="14746039">Here the but-for world, was the decision that the employer might make, do I dock his pay; do I give him a demotion; do I fire him for all purposes, or do I simply say, that I would not have authorized him to be absent at all for the ball game.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.847" offset="14813853">None of those things is specified, and the entire test of the filter is as vague as the statute.</text>
