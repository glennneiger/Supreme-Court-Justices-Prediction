            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">Justice Alito has our opinion this morning in case 138 on the original dockets South Carolina versus North Carolina.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="7.925" offset="136108">This is an original action concerning the Catawba River and the matter now before us concern South Carolina's exceptions to the Special Master's First Interim Report.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.998" offset="184383">The Special Master recommended that we granted motions of three non-state entities to intervene in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.261" offset="213431">They are the city of Charlotte, North Carolina the Catawba River water supply project and Duke Energy Carolinas.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.783" offset="247495">We overrule South Carolina's exceptions with respect to the Catawba River water supply projects and Duke Energy Carolinas but we sustain South Carolina's exceptions with respect to the City of Charlotte.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.317" offset="301620">We apply the standard for intervention by non-state entities in an original action that we announced nearly 60 years ago in New Jersey versus New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.148" offset="341013">“An intervener whose state is already a party should have the burden of showing some compelling interest in his own right apart from his interest in a class with all other citizens and creatures of the state which interest is not properly represented by the state.”</text>
            <text syncTime="74.552" offset="402557">For the reasons set out more fully in our opinion we find that the Catawba River water supply projects and Duke Energy Carolinas have carried this burden but that the city of Charlotte has not.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.907" offset="448010">The Catawba River water supply project is an unusual by state entity that supplies water to consumers in both states is jointly operated and funded by authorities in both states and is not properly represented by either state in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.877" offset="511854">Duke Energy Carolinas operates a series of 11 dams on the Catawba River in both states and in accordance with the terms and its license issued by the Federal energy regulatory commission controls the Catawba River’s minimum flow into South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.357" offset="573816">Neither state properly represents these interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.653" offset="586982">Like the Catawba River water supply project the city of Charlotte transfers water from the Catawba River basin, those transfers however fall solely within North Carolina's equitable share of the river and North Carolina properly represents the city's interests in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.856" offset="655841">Chief Justice has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part in which Justices Thomas, Ginsberg and Sotomayor have joined.</text>
