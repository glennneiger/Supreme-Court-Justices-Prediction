            <text syncTime="8.154" offset="138073">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Biotech crops have produced enormous benefits for the nation's farmers and consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.343" offset="170778">The district court in this case issued a broad-based injunction against the planting of a highly beneficial, genetically engineered alfalfa crop.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.215" offset="206305">In entering and sustaining that injunction, the courts below erred in two fundamental respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.202" offset="230233">First, they short-circuited the requisite inquiry into the likelihood of reparable -- irreparable harm, because they reasoned that the agency was going to get into this anyway in the course of preparing its environmental impact statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.093" offset="281746">And--</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="44.529" offset="283523">Mr. Garre, the Respondents argue that we should dismiss the writ here as improvidently granted, and I wonder if you could explain why that isn't the preferred course of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.503" offset="331483">They contend that when this was before the Ninth Circuit, your firm could have but did not contest the -- the vacatur of the APHIS deregulation order.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.374" offset="370876">It's argued that an environmental impact statement is likely to be issued very soon, or fairly soon.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.112" offset="397834">Maybe the Solicitor General could give us an estimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.730" offset="408388">If we agree with your argument that the Ninth Circuit applied the wrong preliminary injunction standard and remand for them to apply the right preliminary injunction standard, the case may be moot by the time they do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.522" offset="455513">And the alternative is for us to plow into the extremely fact-bound question whether applying what you contend to be the correct preliminary injunction standard of relief would be warranted on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.215" offset="518311">In light of all that, why shouldn't we take their suggestion?</text>

            <text syncTime="109.368" offset="542866">First as to the vacatur, we appealed the judgment that contains the vacatur and the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.522" offset="567526">And our notice of appeal, which is on page 59 and 61 of the excerpts of record in the Ninth Circuit, makes clear that we explicitly appealed the vacatur as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.044" offset="605560">And let me explain that a little bit more, but first I want to say as to the environmental impact statement, the government can address that more, but my understanding is that we're probably about a year away from the environmental impact statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.650" offset="647983">This case presents important legal issues concerning the entry of injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.637" offset="667941">We think the Court properly granted certiorari and should decide those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.672" offset="684136">We think that, although the record is large, that this Court can decide, as it did in Winter, that as a matter of law this record does not support a finding of irreparable harm--</text>

            <text syncTime="170.120" offset="785910">You are not challenging that.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.405" offset="799075">Well, it seems to me if there's no deregulation decision in place, then we're back to the Plant Protection Act, and there's no authorization for the planting of these crops.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.963" offset="845260">So as long as you haven't challenged the vacation of the deregulation decision, I don't see how there's anything for us to deal with.</text>

            <text syncTime="210.845" offset="948809">You keep saying -- I know you appealed it originally, but the point is that you didn't seek certiorari on that ground.</text>

            <text syncTime="216.397" offset="970961">--Well, we -- our argument all along, Justice Sotomayor has been that the court, the district court, erred in not adopting the government's proposed judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.653" offset="1004084">If you look on page 184 of the petition appendix, that proposed judgment makes clear that it's intended to replace the district court's judgment, including the vacatur.</text>

            <text syncTime="249.470" offset="1103350">And under the vacatur, the normal APA remedy is a remand to the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.772" offset="1124456">In fact, there are some courts that say you can't get anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.457" offset="1135219">But whether you can or can't, it's clear that the burden is on you to get something short of complete remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.246" offset="1170432">The burden is on your friends to get -- establish the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.134" offset="1186001">The problem with combining the two, it seems to me, is that you are imposing on them the burden to meet the injunction standard simply to get a remand to which they are entitled under the APA.</text>

            <text syncTime="811.490" offset="3351343">The agency has received on the order of 145,000 public comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.143" offset="3369942">And, so, in addition to parsing through those and seeing which of them need to be responded to, the agency wants to consult with other Federal agencies.</text>

            <text syncTime="900.694" offset="3708176">And if that had happened, the agency could then have issued an administrative order that embodied the same proposed conditions that were embodied in the injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1631.915" offset="6633054">I'm not sure to what extent the Petitioners or -- or the government, frankly, have focused precisely on that particular language of the district court's judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.337" offset="6666804">But it has certainly been kind of the fundamental basis for our appeal to the court of appeals and for Petitioners' appeal and certiorari petition that what they are complaining about was the fact that a complete injunction was put in place, instead of an injunction that embodied the government's proposed protective measures, and we were focusing on the choice between two injunctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.083" offset="6753740">We didn't focus specifically on the alternative course of action in which the matter might have been sent back to the agency and the agency would then have embodied those proposed protective measures in an administrative order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.474" offset="6803268">But I think the issue whether those protective measures would have been sufficient to prevent irreparable harm to the plaintiffs has been preserved throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.664" offset="6836078">Just to say one more thing about the CEQ regulations, this Court has held in the past that those are entitled to deference, and, again, they don't preclude all action during the pendency of the EIS.</text>
