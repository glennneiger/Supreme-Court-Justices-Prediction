            <text syncTime="15.693" offset="168166">Such a conviction does not qualify as a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.162" offset="190109">A violent felony means one that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.</text>

            <text syncTime="33.321" offset="238696">Physical force in this context means something more than a mere quantum of physical contact, and it requires violent aggression that is likely to cause physical injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.629" offset="287911">This conclusion is guided by the rules of statutory construction in this Court's precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.199" offset="310168">The better-reasoned circuits have applied these principles to find that physical force means something more than de minimis contact.</text>

            <text syncTime="99.347" offset="502847">But the State, unlike Florida, says, our battery statute for our State law purposes is a crime of violence; therefore, for our State law enhancements the person who pleads guilty to a battery offense will be deemed one who has committed a crime of violence, if that's the State law.</text>

            <text syncTime="125.247" offset="606396">Then the mere fact that the State found that it qualified under its own recidivist statute would not bind the Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.401" offset="638997">Why we say that Hearns is binding is the proposition that it found the elements of a battery offense and the -- the ACC looks to those elements to determine whether it is a violent felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.826" offset="692705">Congress didn't say that it -- the offender had to have conduct that involved the use of physical force, but a prior that had as an element the use.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.432" offset="727186">So the fact that the State statute may qualify under its State recidivism wouldn't be the same determination that it didn't have as an element the use of force.</text>

            <text syncTime="177.346" offset="814853">And what we said in Chambers is that the nature of the behavior that likely underlies a statutory phrase matters in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.439" offset="867203">If you think of the seven different things covered by one statute in James or Chambers, two of them, failing to return from a furlough and failing to return from work in day release, seem to me quite possibly to describe one thing, not two.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.901" offset="937002">Now, how do we know that striking or touching describes two things?</text>
            <text syncTime="214.471" offset="963333">I couldn't find any instance, and we had the library looking.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.590" offset="975768">I couldn't find any instance in Florida where those two things have ever been charged separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.161" offset="1006070">And they looked at hundreds.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.779" offset="1012548">So -- so why do we think it's two crimes, rather than just one called "striking or touching"?</text>

            <text syncTime="312.634" offset="1356006">Your Honor, you would apply first the plain language of the statute, and "to touch" means the slightest contact, as the courts have held.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.907" offset="1389025">At pages 41 to 42 we spelled out the offenses of spitting, making slight contact, that justified a battery conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="356.680" offset="1532176">Your Honor, the problem with saying that just because it's a felony, therefore it can't be considered is that the statute first describes the prohibited conduct and says that the conduct is in the first subparagraph, the penalty is in the second.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.590" offset="1591735">So the very same conduct is necessary for either a felony or a misdemeanor, and essentially no force times two is still zero.</text>

            <text syncTime="2170.566" offset="8787634">Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think, first of all, it would be a mistake to think that Congress defines the range of ACCA predicate with particular consideration to the ways that hypothetical defendants might -- might commit even quintessentially violent crimes in particular cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.426" offset="8851163">This Court, for example, considered in Taylor v. United States a very similar argument, which was that the statutory reference to burglary ought to be interpreted in a way that would limit it to aggravated burglaries of a certain sort, armed burglaries or burglaries of occupied buildings, in order to make sure that that reference to burglary better fit with Congress's purposes in selecting the worst of the worst.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.274" offset="8938517">This Court declined that invitation because it decided that Congress's unmodified views of the word "burglary" indicated that Congress meant for that word to take on its ordinary meaning as it was used in the laws of the many states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.082" offset="8989717">It said that Congress would have recognized that ordinary burglaries can be committed in individual instances in ways that don't seem particularly harmful, by unarmed defenders of unoccupied buildings in remote locations, but that Congress nevertheless made a categorical judgment that burglaries as a whole present sufficient potential for harm that they ought to be covered as ACCA predicates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.178" offset="9078115">And I think a similar analysis applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.114" offset="9085848">Congress probably wasn't focused on the least amount of force that it takes to commit the crime of battery, but it was entitled to make a judgment that any battery, any unlawful use of force against another person, categorically presents sufficient potential for harm that--</text>

            <text syncTime="2264.444" offset="9163170">And at that point, you have to decide, is there an element there of force?</text>

            <text syncTime="2333.588" offset="9439754">In ordinary criminal law, despite what some intuitions seem to be, the least touching of another in anger is a form of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.028" offset="9477580">It is a use of physical force.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.980" offset="9485312">I think to the extent that, Your Honor, you are inclined to look to the purposes of this statute, what Congress would have thought the mind run of cases that would fall under Subsection 1's use of force provision would cover, I think there you look at the reported cases in Florida, we see that the kinds of crimes that are prosecuted under the touching or striking prong of that statute are, in fact, quite harmful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.076" offset="9573710">It's not at all difficult to see why Congress would have been concerned about these types of crimes, both because in many instances they involve conduct that is probably better described as touching or striking but it is -- nevertheless risks substantial harm to the victim, like choking, like beating the victim's head against the car window, to use an example from one of those cases cited in our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="3129.095" offset="12621782">Well, Justice Scalia, I would certainly be inclined to agree with you but it's particularly clear given the text and context of the purposes of section 922(g)(9) that battery ought to be covered by that definition, misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.903" offset="12677057">But we think that the reason why it is also clear under subsection (1) of the ACCA is that the use of force element of the definitional provision is separate from the degree of seriousness with which the State chooses to treat the crime, yet the crime is punished as a felony, and if has as an element the use of physical force, then it qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA, just as if it is punished as a misdemeanor, it qualifies as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence under section 922(g)(9).</text>

            <text syncTime="3191.919" offset="12873080">--Well, the Court in United States v. Rodriguez in analyzing the coordinate provision of the ACCA that covers serious drug offenses said that the felony aspect of that definition is satisfied by a recidivist enhancement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.095" offset="12933789">And we think that the conclusion in that case, and it is not disputed among the parties, applies with equal force in this case to the proper interpretation of violent felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.034" offset="12965554">But it was certainly true by the time that Congress enacted the ACCA, which the legislative history indicates Congress understood would cover assault crimes, for example, that there were certain kinds of batteries and assaults that, although otherwise may be punished as simple batteries and assaults, as misdemeanors, could be elevated to a felony if for example they were committed against a law enforcement officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.447" offset="13051235">It simply was not unheard of for simple battery to be elevated to a felony under certain circumstances in 1986 Congress enacted the present version of ACCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.386" offset="13086971">At the end of the day, we think that Congress -- every indication that we have in both the text, the context, the purpose of the statute and its background suggests that Congress was in fact deliberately tracking the definition of battery when it enacted the primary definition of violent felony in subsection (1).</text>

            <text syncTime="3270.686" offset="13188117">Instead they chose to incorporate the general definition of the crime of battery; that is correct, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.089" offset="13205776">We think that to the extent that the Court is inclined to restrict the terms of -- that Congress chose to use itself to physical force as only exceeding a certain threshold, to include some batteries and not other batteries, the Court would be setting up a very difficult test for Federal sentencing courts to apply in the real world.</text>

            <text syncTime="3300.807" offset="13308698">--Well, as the Chief Justice has noted, States don't have quite the same compulsion to sort different factual offenses into different boxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.794" offset="13340568">Prosecutors, as the prosecutor did in this case, can use either of the two alternative prongs of Florida's battery definition to punish what is essentially the same offense, which is the crime of battery, that deserves the same punishment regardless of which prong the prosecutor proceeds under, whether the bodily injury prong or the touching or striking prong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.640" offset="13423950">And Petitioner's concession that at least Federal sentencing courts could draw distinctions between touches and strikes, may have some resonance in the State of Florida, but has resonance for the rest of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.182" offset="13466164">Most State assault and battery statutes don't contain explicit references to striking, but subsume striking within the range of conduct prescribed by their offensive touching prong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.371" offset="13506915">So it simply wouldn't be possible, in most cases, for a court to look at the cold record of the underlying State conviction and try to discern exactly how much force was involved in the offense and whether that force satisfied the Petitioner's proposed threshold, whatever it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.599" offset="13575774">At the end of the day, the principal question before the court is one that is, primarily, relevant to the Section 922(g)(9) provision and other federal misdemeanor domestic violence provisions and one that we think, in considering the purposes of those statutes and the very serious dangers that they address, the Court ought to interpret the plain text of the statutes in light of their plain meaning.</text>

            <text syncTime="3475.971" offset="14009302">And, Your Honor, I wanted to note this is not just an academic exercise on noticing what physical force means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.890" offset="14033021">Absent this one finding of Mr. Johnson's prior conviction was a violent felony, it raised his guideline range, from 27 to 33 months, to a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.146" offset="14073981">So the danger of including this crime, when the art or criminal act was not designed to include all crimes or all offenders, means that it took all discretion away from the sentencing judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.038" offset="14117554">In ACCA, Congress set a superior high standard requiring three priors on three -- that occurred on three separate occasions, and so looking at this decision, when Mr. Johnson was put inside the box, that tied the judge's hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.898" offset="14177008">If this were not considered a violent felony, the sentencing judge could consider that under the guidelines in the 3553 factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.653" offset="14208042">But to read physical force so broadly is to, in essence, collapse the distinction between those violent offenses that are meant to be included in the Armed Career Criminal Act and those that are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.794" offset="14256630">Your Honors, I would also note one matter, that physical contact is used in the assault statutes under the Federal Code, so there is a different provision -- a different meaning to physical contact than to physical force, and the physical force, in this definition, is looking at what level and what sort of force Congress intended to require to impose this very high sentencing standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.826" offset="14356731">And this Court had rejected, in Shepard, the government's same happenstance argument that prosecutions would depend on recordkeeping and charging decisions, and so, for all the reasons argued, Mr. Johnson would ask that this Court vacate the lower decision and remand for resentencing.</text>
