            <text syncTime="245.865" offset="1088930">If this Court is troubled by a broad rule and is inclined not to issue a general rule, it may simply recognize deportation as among the few collateral consequences that is so severe and so material in a high number of cases in which it applies that the Strickland claim should be allowed to go forward.</text>

            <text syncTime="379.969" offset="1625276">You take the risk of any mis-advice, any misunderstanding, with respect to collateral conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="1988.805" offset="8060594">And I think it's highly notable that the rules committee for the criminal rules has twice considered whether to amend Rule 11 and is going to consider it again contemporaneously with this case, to require the judge to say to an alien defendant, you may want to take into account removal consequences of a criminal conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.919" offset="8141051">In other words, there are rule-based ways to address some of the concerns that Justice Alito raised without constitutionalizing a new area of collateral consequences that would impose new duties that actually would divert the lawyer from his criminal law function, whereas the mis-advice line has not created those problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.428" offset="8219105">And as I started to say earlier, the fact that ten Federal circuits have said no duty to advise on collateral consequences while seven have recognized that mis-advice on collateral consequences can provide relief, has not led to a series of difficult Strickland hearings that are unmanageable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3295.170" offset="13286128">But that is to suggest that it's so important in all situations and it is more important than collateral consequence that may affect citizens.</text>

            <text syncTime="3314.613" offset="13363869">If the reason to treat it differently because it is viewed as so severe, it's truly been a subjective inquiry as what collateral consequence is severe to this client.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.593" offset="13411830">And it ultimately prefers a class of citizens -- those who are non-citizens -- over citizens who may have just as much important place on collateral consequences they face.</text>
