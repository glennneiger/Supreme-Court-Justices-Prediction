            <text syncTime="1654.762" offset="6724483">"such witnesses shall be summoned and appear at the cost of the Commonwealth. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.651" offset="6735976">And unlike some statutes that say the defendant shall subpoena or shall summon -- for example, like the Idaho and the North Dakota statutes that the Petitioners cite -- they are express in saying it has to be the defendant who issues a summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.924" offset="6801074">This just says "shall be summoned".</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.174" offset="6810164">In a criminal trial at the time these Petitioners were being tried, there were two parties that have the authority to issue summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.092" offset="6837750">One was the clerk of court; that is, a defendant would go to the court and say: These are my witnesses; have them produced for trial on this date.</text>

            <text syncTime="1693.184" offset="6878187">So the statute simply doesn't say it has to be the Commonwealth, it has to be the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="3478.455" offset="14019229">But the fact is Virginia knows how to write a good notice-and-demand statute and has done it, and contrast the -- the new statute, which gives 28 days notice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3506.805" offset="14132600">They were wrong on both of those counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.567" offset="14139705">After the defendants' trials, in a case called Brooks, the -- the Virginia Court of Appeals suggested that the defendant could ask the prosecution to bring the witness in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.250" offset="14186412">Many defendants did that, including Grant, the defendant on whom -- in the case on whom the Commonwealth relies so heavily.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.310" offset="14210654">The prosecution ignored those requests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.170" offset="14218073">It was still taking the view that this is not -- this is not testimonial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.809" offset="14232701">Up until the moment that this Court decided Melendez-Diaz, the Commonwealth in Virginia in -- in Grant said, we don't have to bring the witness in; the witness -- the defendant should subpoena the witness if he wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.803" offset="14288603">No court has ever held -- no court has ever held in Virginia that the prosecution bears the risk of -- of no-shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.113" offset="14313890">Now, the Commonwealth and the United States suggest: Oh, it's okay to -- to transform the way trials are conducted by allowing the prosecution to present affidavits because you can backfill with the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.405" offset="14371046">I think that goes against decisions of this Court that say when there's a specific right addressed to a particular situation, we rely on that, not on the Due Process Clause.</text>
