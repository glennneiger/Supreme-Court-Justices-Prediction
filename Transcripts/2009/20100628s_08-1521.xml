          <heading>Opinion Announcement of Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</heading>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="7.701" stopTime="852.042">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="7.701" offset="136192">Two years ago in District of Columbia versus Heller, we held that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms in the home for purposes of self-defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.070" offset="185720">The Heller case did not involve a law enacted by a state or by any subdivision of a state, and therefore, Heller did not decide whether the Second Amendment applies to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.730" offset="236293">This case requires us to address that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.338" offset="250817">This litigation began when several Chicago residents brought suit, challenging Chicago ordinances that effectively ban handgun possession by virtually all private persons in the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.811" offset="304630">Chicago has high rates of violent crime and the Chicago residents who brought suit, fear for their safety and want to keep handguns in their homes for self-protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.076" offset="349769">The litigation against Chicago and similar litigation against the Chicago suburb of Oak Park were dismissed by the district court and the Seventh Circuit affirmed, relying primarily on several cases decided by this case -- this Court in the late 19th Century.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.659" offset="428032">We granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.192" offset="434197">In order to explain the question, we must decide, it's helpful to review very briefly some basic constitutional history.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.496" offset="467425">The provisions of the Bill of Rights originally applied only to the Federal Government and that is how things stood until after the Civil War.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.443" offset="499190">After the Civil War, the ratification of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments changed the relationship between the Federal Government and the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.926" offset="537119">Two provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment figure in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.408" offset="555092">The first is the Privileges or Immunities Clause which prohibits a state from abridging "the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="122.044" offset="593648">The second is the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment which prohibits a state from depriving any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.782" offset="636594">At the time of the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, there were those who thought that the phrase "Privileges or Immunities of citizens of the United States" protected all of the rights guaranteed by the Bill of Rights and there are prominent scholars today who continue to hold that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.535" offset="707542">The meaning of the Privileges or Immunities Clause came before the Court in the Slaughter-House Cases in 1873.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.874" offset="736904">In that case, in a sharply divided decision, the Court gave the Privileges or Immunities Clause of their own very narrow interpretation and the late 19th Century cases on which the Seventh Circuit relied have generally been interpreted as holding that the right to keep and bear arms does not qualify as one of the privileges or immunities of national citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.948" offset="833243">While the Slaughter-House Cases meant that the right set out in the Bill of Rights would not be protected by the Privileges or Immunities Clause against infringement by the states, the Court beginning around the turn of the Century began to consider whether those rights were protected against abridgment by the states under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.765" offset="924463">The Court's decisions on this question fall into two distinct errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.823" offset="940763">The first runs from around to the end of the 19th Century until roughly the middle of the 20th Century.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.448" offset="971170">The second one is from the end of the prior era to the present day and has featured what has often been called the process of “selective incorporation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="227.451" offset="1015265">Now let me return to the pre-selective incorporation era.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.169" offset="1030102">The three characteristics of the cases that were handed down during that period should be noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.074" offset="1053717">First, some of the Court's cases during this era said that the Due Process Clause protects only those rights that are indispensable characteristics of any civilized society.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.721" offset="1100319">Second, the Court during that time was not hesitant to hold that a right set out in the Bill of Rights was not protected by the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.118" offset="1137936">And third, even when a right set out in the Bill of Rights was held to fall within the conception of due process, the protection or the remedies that were available against the states often differed from the protection or remedies that were available against the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.959" offset="1209302">During this pre-selective incorporation era, there was viable theory concerning the relationship between the Bill of Rights and the states and that has often been called the theory of "total incorporation" which as the name suggests meant that the Due Process Clause would be totally incorporated -- would totally incorporate all of the provisions of the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.964" offset="1301253">The Court never accepted that theory, but eventually it moved in that direction by beginning the process of selective incorporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.082" offset="1333750">And selective incorporation meant that the Court incorporated provisions of the Bill of Rights one-by-one rather than all at once.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.422" offset="1367082">The Court abandoned the three characteristics of the earlier era that I have previously noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.798" offset="1388607">First, the Court made it clear that the governing standard is not whether a right is an essential feature of any civilized nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.612" offset="1419849">Instead, the Court considered whether or right it's fundamental from a distinctly American perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.153" offset="1446076">Second, the Court shed any reluctance to hold that rights protected by the Bill of Rights met the requirements for protection under the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.068" offset="1481707">Indeed the Court eventually incorporated virtually all of the rights in the Bill of Rights under the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.332" offset="1514726">And third, the Court emphatically rejected what it called, "The notion that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the states only a watered-down, subjective version of the individual guarantees of the Bill of Rights.”</text>
            <text syncTime="365.593" offset="1567807">Instead, the Court took the position that incorporated Bill of Rights protections "are all to be enforced against the states under the Fourteenth Amendment according to the same standards that protect those personal rights against federal encroachment."</text>
            <text syncTime="381.598" offset="1631859">I now turn directly to the question before us in this case, does the Second Amendment right recognized in Heller apply to the states and if so, does it apply to the states to the same extent as it applies to the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.015" offset="1685462">The Court holds that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.833" offset="1692776">I have filed an opinion setting out the judgment of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.268" offset="1706465">Justice Thomas joins that opinion in part, but he has also filed a concurring opinion explaining that he would hold that the right to keep and bear arms is one of the privileges or immunities of national citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.910" offset="1761008">I will now describe the remainder of the opinion that I have filed and that is joined by the Chief Justice, Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.836" offset="1800714">We analyzed the question presented here under the Due Process Clause, that is the practice that the Court has followed now for more than a century and we continue on that path and we hold that the Heller right easily meets the standard that the Court has used during the last half century.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.275" offset="1882530">The right to keep and bear arms is implicit in our understanding of ordered liberty and is deeply rooted in the traditions of our country.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.883" offset="1916907">Heller thoroughly explored the origins of the right and show that it was considered fundamental by those who drafted and ratified the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.512" offset="1951493">This understanding continued during the early years of the Republic when many states adopted constitutional provisions, protecting the right to keep and bear arms.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.978" offset="1993289">Evidence from the Civil War period is particularly instructive.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.028" offset="2009485">When the Civil War ended, soldiers in the Union Army were allowed to keep their rifles when they returned home.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.503" offset="2039474">More than 180,000 African-Americans served in the Union Army and when they returned home often to the states of the old Confederacy, systematic efforts were made to disarm them and other blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.022" offset="2097465">Armed parties often consisting of ex-Confederate soldiers serving in the state militias forcibly took firearms from newly freed slaves and other blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.440" offset="2143232">The Reconstruction era Congress was alarmed by these practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.914" offset="2161100">A document that was published by Congress at that time recounted the following story which is representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.196" offset="2190252">In one town the marshal took all arms from the returning black soldiers and then was "very prompt in shooting the blacks whenever an opportunity occurred."</text>
            <text syncTime="531.248" offset="2230376">Union Army Commanders tried to stop these abuses by issuing orders, securing the right of all people to keep and bear arms, but Congress decided that more was needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.741" offset="2272381">It first turned to ordinary legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.440" offset="2283144">It enacted the Freedmen’s Bureau Act of 1866 which explicitly guaranteed the right of all citizens "to have the full and equal benefit of the constitutional right to bear arms."</text>
            <text syncTime="558.182" offset="2338105">The Civil Rights Act 1866 had a similar aim, but Congress feared that these Civil Rights Laws would be held to exceed Congress' power and Congress then proposed the Fourteenth Amendment which was ratified.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.529" offset="2403516">In the face of this evidence, Chicago and Oak Park contend that the Reconstruction era Congress did not want to protect the right of all persons to keep and bear arms, but solely sought to outlaw discriminatory laws and practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.145" offset="2466001">This argument is implausible.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.182" offset="2474151">It is inconsistent with the clear terms of the Freedmen's Bureau Act of 1866 and outlawing the private possession of firearms in the South would have left blacks vulnerable to their worst abusers, the local peace officers and the state militias.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.053" offset="2545622">Chicago, Oak Park and the dissenting opinions in this case make many other arguments against incorporation of the Heller right.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.911" offset="2577074">I will comment on only three.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.769" offset="2588463">The first, -- the first set of these arguments basically disputes Heller's interpretation of the original meaning of the Second Amendment in light of recent scholarship.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.961" offset="2653247">It is hard to think of a question of original meaning that has now been explored more thoroughly than the right to keep and bear arms and we reaffirm Heller's analysis of that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.552" offset="2703611">The second argument is basically a plea that we return to the pre-incorporation era case law at least for this one case.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.904" offset="2741018">It is argued that conditions vary from state-to-state and from city-to-city and that each state and city should be free to enact the firearm laws that are most consistent with its interests and the values of its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.113" offset="2801831">It's also argued that it is beneficial to allow states and cities to experiment with a variety of different approaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.044" offset="2833596">These arguments are not new.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.573" offset="2839761">They are precisely the arguments that would -- were made by dissenters, most notably by Justice Harlan when the Court began the process of “selective incorporation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="694.152" offset="2882079">It was argued that the entire county should not be bound by a single rule regarding searches and seizures, the privilege against self-incrimination, double jeopardy, the right to counsel and so on, but the Court disagreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.337" offset="2934742">Those who proposed that we return to the old approach in this case are presumably not asking that we undo all the incorporation cases decided during the past half century.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.593" offset="2983748">What is proposed instead, it seems, is a return to the old rules for the Second Amendment right only.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.032" offset="3013528">We refuse to take that approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.787" offset="3020528">Incorporation must be governed by neutral principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.381" offset="3038919">The other argument that I will comment on is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.208" offset="3054279">It is argued that the Second Amendment right should not be incorporated because it has controversial public safety implications.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.787" offset="3088551">The argument goes as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.980" offset="3097328">Some people think that the proliferation of handguns leads to increased crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.104" offset="3117808">Other people think that allowing private citizens to own handguns and keep them in their homes for self-defense will promote public safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.326" offset="3154693">It is argued that because it is unclear which view is correct, the right to keep and bear arms should not be made binding on the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.462" offset="3191265">This argument like the one just discussed is inconsistent with our “selective incorporation” cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.784" offset="3216551">The Second Amendment right is not the only provision in the Bill of Rights that has controversial public safety implications.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.669" offset="3248107">The provisions of the Bill of Rights to governed law enforcement practices, the prosecution of cases, criminal cases and the punishment of offenders all have disputed public safety implications, but the Court has never refused to incorporate any provision of the Bill of Rights on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.392" offset="3326997">Accordingly it is the judgment of the Court that the right recognized in Heller is fully applicable to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.892" offset="3348940">As Heller notes it, this right is not unlimited.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.028" offset="3361583">Heller held that the particular ordinances at issue in that case violated the Second Amendment, but the holding went no further.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.448" offset="3395229">The decision on the Second Circuit -- of the Seventh Circuit is reversed, the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.980" offset="3429292">Justice Scalia has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.111" offset="3441831">Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.135" offset="3465968">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.492" offset="3475372">Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor have joined.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="852.042" stopTime="1674.423">
            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="852.042" offset="3513616">Justice Alito said Justice Stevens has written a separate dissenting opinion that discusses why the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of the substantive due process does not include a right to possess a firearm in the home for the purpose of private self-defense and I agree with the conclusion of that opinion, but in addition I have a written a dissenting opinion in which Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor joined and that separate opinion directly address the incorporation question that you’ve just heard about and particularly the majority's conclusion that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates and applies against the states the right to keep and bear arms for the purpose of private self-defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.553" offset="3699608">The opinion explains why we disagree with that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.453" offset="3719252">Now the opinion has three parts, not short. [Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="908.358" offset="3738896">In the first part, it returns to Heller.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.944" offset="3753211">The Court then there concluded and I quote, "That individual self-defense was the central component of the Second Amendment's right to keep and bear arms."</text>
            <text syncTime="924.650" offset="3803993">Four Justices, I was one, disagreed with that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.321" offset="3822696">Since Heller was decided, numerous historians and scholars have expressed the view that the Court got its history wrong and I like to think by implication that the dissenters got it right.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.602" offset="3875777">So given the shakiness of the historical foundations, why should the Court now go on to extend in a very broad way Heller's applicability.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.593" offset="3915797">But, Heller has been decided and majority of the Court does not wish to revisit that case, so we go on to the second part of the opinion which accepts Heller as a given and explains why even on that assumption, the majority's incorporation conclusion is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.478" offset="4007330">Well, why is it wrong?</text>
            <text syncTime="977.587" offset="4015794">Why is this right to keep and bear arms for purposes of personal self-defense?</text>
            <text syncTime="983.014" offset="4037528">Why is it not fundamental enough to warrant incorporation and application to the states?</text>
            <text syncTime="990.810" offset="4068665">First, as the Court conceded in Heller and here I quote Heller again, "The threat that the new Federal Government would destroy the citizen's militia,” that’s the militia part of this, “by taking away their arms was the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.378" offset="4146928">That right was codified in a written constitution."</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.442" offset="4167199">Thus the protection of the different part of it, the right to private self-defense was from a framer's perspective at best a secondary motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.264" offset="4210458">Second, there is no consensus in America that the right to private armed self-defense is fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.757" offset="4252463">Rather there are opposing points of view, each held by many Americans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.086" offset="4277750">Some believe that the right is necessary to protect their lives, of those attacked in their homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.894" offset="4305021">Others believe that regulation of the right is necessary in order to save the lives of those attacked with guns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.493" offset="4339399">And therefore the appropriate level of gun regulation has long been and continues to be a hotly contested matter of political debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.935" offset="4393211">Third, unlike other rights, and I think every other right that the Court has found to be incorporated, incorporating the private self-defense right will not further some important, broader, additional constitutional objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.505" offset="4467399">Unlike the First Amendment's rights of free speech, free press, assembly and petition, the private self-defense right is not part, an essential part of a democratic process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.618" offset="4531869">Unlike those others, no one claims this is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.536" offset="4547542">Unlike the First Amendment's religious protections, the Fourth Amendment's protection of criminal suspects, the Fifth and Sixth Amendment's insistence upon fair criminal procedure or the Eighth Amendment's protection against cruel and unusual punishment, the private self-defense right does not significantly protect individuals, I might say quite often unpopular individuals, who would otherwise suffer very unfair or inhumane treatment at the hands of a majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.625" offset="4675960">Unlike the Fifth Amendment's insistence on just compensation for government takings, it does not protect the property rights of what is likely a minority of individuals from the unfair acts of a majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.642" offset="4731967">Unlike the protections offered by almost all of these same amendments, the right at issue here does not involve as to which judge, a matter, as to which judge is, when you compare them to legislatures, seem to have the greater expertise of application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.254" offset="4802393">We have no reason here to think that the political process is not perfectly capable of safeguarding the interests that the Second Amendment protects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.691" offset="4848159">Fourth, to the contrary of what I have just said, we do have strong reason to believe that incorporation of this private right of self-defense will significantly interfere with other basic constitutional objectives, particularly those related to the Constitution's assignment of different tasks to different institutions, to legislatures and to courts, to states and to the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.481" offset="4983369">For one thing, consider the effect of incorporation on the relationship between courts and legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.845" offset="5016806">Every state and many local communities have highly detailed and complicated regulatory schemes governing nearly every aspect of firearm ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.615" offset="5055885">Who can sell guns, how?</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.923" offset="5065080">Who can purchase guns, how?</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.182" offset="5074171">Where they can be possessed, what kinds and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.122" offset="5089949">Each of these regulations is now a potential subject of a federal constitutional challenge and how our federal judges suppose to decide all this issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.378" offset="5134984">Certainly, the stakes are high.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.747" offset="5144388">In nearly every case, the Government is going to argue that those regulations are necessary to help prevent death and injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.679" offset="5176153">We are told that firearms cause well over 60,000 deaths and injuries in the United States each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.877" offset="5208963">An amicus brief in the Chicago case says that that handgun ban there may have saved close to a thousand lives since its enactment, but just as they have here, challengers to regulations are going to argue to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.395" offset="5266954">Well, who is right and how are judges supposed to answer these questions?</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.321" offset="5290674">Legal reasoning is not just going to somehow mechanically find the answer and you can quote as much as you like Blackstone's saying that, a man's home is his castle or whatever, but that will not give you the answer and courts can't simply ignore the fact that these answers to these kinds of questions will rest on matters of empirical fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.410" offset="5383043">How can they decide how important the State's regulatory interest is without addressing the consequences of the gun regulation in question?</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.527" offset="5419510">How can they decide if there is some less restrictive way to further than interest unless they try to figure out what's actually going to happen if those other ways are implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.377" offset="5462977">The point is that empirical matters are bound in all these questions and judges just do not know answers to the sorts of questions that they will have to evaluate in order to decide the need for particular kinds of gun regulation, say the extent to which a ban on loaded handguns will help save the lives of homeowners or of children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.067" offset="5557645">Nor do we judges have readily available tools for finding the answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.211" offset="5578230">I’m not saying they can never do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.572" offset="5587738">I’m just saying it's not their natural forte.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.232" offset="5602367">But at the same time, legislatures do have the ability to do just this kind of thing; to uncover facts, to evaluate the facts, to work out how those evaluations of facts are to given legislative meaning, given the desires of people in their community, they understand facts, they have the tools, they understand the relevance, and legislatures, unlike Article III judges, can be held democratically responsible for their empirically based and (Inaudible) conclusions, that’s their job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.840" offset="5740816">For another thing, consider the effect of incorporation on the constitutional relationship between the states and the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.680" offset="5776133">Since the framing, the states have had plenary authority to regulate private use of firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.570" offset="5803719">Indeed, such regulation is the quintessential exercise of the police power which traditionally has included the power to protect the lives and whims of all persons within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.367" offset="5854919">The Court today substitutes federal regulation for state regulation in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.912" offset="5885116">That makes it more difficult for the states to legislate in ways that reflect local preferences and conditions in an area where it is particularly important that they have the freedom to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.683" offset="5936107">The incidents of gun ownership and gun violence very substantially, as between crowded cities and rural communities and among different regions of the country, different states and their local communities have historically differed about the need for gun regulation as well as about its proper level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.570" offset="6007683">Federalism, traditionally, means that a, "Single courageous state can serve as a laboratory of democracy in search of the right level of regulations, the level that best balances its individual need to prevent gun violence with its citizens desires to encourage self-defense."</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.711" offset="6088244">Democracy means that the people can continue to decide these matters by vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.649" offset="6112068">By way of contrast, incorporation means that a single national standard will be imposed on the people of every state by unelected federal judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.877" offset="6156894">In some, the police power, the need for local decision making, the superiority of legislative decision making, the lack of manageable judicial standards, the comparative desirability of democratic decision making and the life threatening harm that may flow from setting regulations aside all argue here against incorporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.100" offset="6249785">Where the incorporation of other rights has been at issue, and Justice Alito's completely right about this, some of these problems have arisen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.955" offset="6289283">But in this instance, all of these problems are present, all at the same time and all likely present in most, perhaps nearly all of the cases in which the constitutionality of a gun regulation is at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.337" offset="6358768">And at the same time the general factors present in other cases that had favored incorporation here are absent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.433" offset="6391160">The Court does not examine at great length the factors I have mentioned, but rather it rests review, primarily not exclusively, upon its view of history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.665" offset="6428045">The third part of the dissent explains why that history cannot justify incorporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.966" offset="6457302">In our view, the Civil War history really shows something about discrimination and why it's wrong, not about possessing guns, these are special rights, but that’s debatable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.633" offset="6503905">But we conclude the historical records shows that states and localities have consistently enacted firearms regulations, including regulations similar to those at issue here throughout our nation's history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.588" offset="6559807">Conclusion, one, the framers did not write the Second Amendment in order to protect a private right of armed self-defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.477" offset="6595333">Two, there is no consensus if the right is or was fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.012" offset="6617485">Three, no broader constitutional interest or principle supports legal treatment of that right as fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.610" offset="6647892">Four, incorporation is difficult to reconcile with the constitution's allocation of responsibilities between States and the Federal Government, between courts and legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.204" offset="6694285">And five, nothing in 18th, 19th, 20th or 21st Century history shows an unambiguous historical consensus that the right is sufficiently fundamental as to warrant incorporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.655" offset="6752068">In our view, Heller or no Heller, the Fourteenth Amendment does not incorporate a private right of arm self-defense and apply that right against the states.</text>
