            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 814, Raymond Joseph Duvernay, petitioner versus the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.533" offset="253471">Mr. Smith.</text>

            <label>Mr. Benjamin E. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="38.599" offset="257755">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.918" offset="274996">This is an appeal from Fifth Circuit by a young black Selective Service registrant from conviction at least in District of Louisiana, for refusal to be inducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.352" offset="324733">I might say, the ability of the Court to this particular registrant when all the way through the system up to the point of where he was asked to be inducted and had said that he was not going to be inducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.297" offset="372590">Now, he was in charged by indictment in courts, tried for this offense in federal court and was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.200" offset="408221">Now, on the -- the thing that happened was that he attempted to defend his defense for the criminal charge, was that black people had been excluded from his Selective Service Board and in the midst of the trial of the case below, we discovered that the chairman of this black person's board was the president of the United Ku Klux Klan of America, Manny Jackhill, and at the same time, we found out in the process of counter case that the defendant had been denied an appeal by his board.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.865" offset="562866">When he tried to tell him that he had a hardship deferment, it turned out that he and his mother with his sole support of himself and six and brothers and sisters, so that when the Fifth Circuit decided this case, it said that the defenses were foreclosed because he had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies below.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.367" offset="640815">But I say to you that that can't possibly be because the boards below, the board in Louisiana, Board number 42 was perfectly incompetent to determine whether or not it was properly composed, whether its board chairman should have been the chairman or whether there should have been the board dissolved because the fact that negroes were excluded from service on the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.556" offset="733602">These are constitutional issues which the board has no jurisdiction over and which could not be raised before the board and we'd have to admit be necessarily raised before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.049" offset="779577">If we follow Judge Thornberry's opinion in the circuit, it would necessarily mean that these serious constitutional issues could never be raised because we know they can't be raised before the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.914" offset="835062">The Government in its brief here agrees with us on that point and they cannot then under the Thornberry opinion out of the circuit be raised in the federal court and we know that that is impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.498" offset="885321">If we cannot raise it in federal court, it simply means that this defendant would then go to jail for five years in this case without ever having been able to raise these serious constitutional questions in any court competent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.404" offset="948955">And I think Mr. Justice Murphy when he wrote the concurring opinion in Esten , put it very well, he said that if at some point, these remedies are not available, well then, what's going to happen is that these people are going to go -- if it violates due process, then I'm just trying to find the citation.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.030" offset="1067447">To sustain the conviction of the two petitioners and this was in Esten.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.916" offset="1086986">In these cases, we'd require adherence to the proposition that a person may be criminally punished without ever being afforded the opportunity to prove that the prosecution is based on an invalid administrative order.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.764" offset="1134425">That violates the most elementary and fundamental concepts of due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.535" offset="1157517">Now, actually, I think that what we're trying to do is raise a constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.410" offset="1193044">The fact that negroes were excluded from the Board and the chairman was a clansman, that he was denied of appeal and the fact that these facts were not raised in the board below, in the draft board is absolutely irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.384" offset="1268903">They wouldn't have anything to do with this classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.538" offset="1281546">If he had waived a right that related to classification and we were up here talking about classification, that would be one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.924" offset="1311117">We're not talking about this man's classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.010" offset="1319372">We're talking about his constitutional rights to talk about the composition of that draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.258" offset="1340374">And what would be the effect, I ask the Court, of saying to this particular thing, you can never raise those issues in the Board and you can never raise those issues in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.260" offset="1388440">What would be the effect on the Selective Service System?</text>
            <text syncTime="324.561" offset="1401605">Because the Selective Service System itself is based upon the fairness of the system and presumably upon the knowledge by the country that the system operates in a fair manner that it reflects the qualities of life in America, that it reflects the characteristics of the community where the people lived that they have to serve, that they are drafted by their friends and neighbors and here we find draft boards and we all knew it in Louisiana where not one negro had ever served.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.943" offset="1515186">And they had an open clansman on the Board and they knew it but they didn't do anything about it until after this case when they got rid of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.516" offset="1553429">But what the confidence of the country would be shaken in these boards if we can't raise these issues and I say that we're required to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.153" offset="1591986">We can't be foreclosed to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.277" offset="1600449">The circuit opinion in this regard has got to be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.299" offset="1612570">I can't see how the system can survive knowing where the country knows that it is an illegal system, it operates in open violation of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendment and what the Government says in the -- what does the Government say in defense of this?</text>
            <text syncTime="393.014" offset="1675473">They say, “Well, this is a -- this is like a malapportioned legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.353" offset="1692818">This is -- this is really not too bad, you know.”</text>
            <text syncTime="400.776" offset="1706506">But actually, what they're saying and it would violate the separation of powers if we came in and try to reform the system, that's where we raise these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.759" offset="1738376">They don't want these questions raised before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.050" offset="1751542">But what I'm saying what they're saying is that the executive can be just as unconstitutional as he wants and he can get away with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.475" offset="1781321">The Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendment applies to everybody but the executive.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.447" offset="1793128">It doesn't apply to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.263" offset="1800443">And let's talk about the practical effect of a young black militant and the record shows that that's what the case was here.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.656" offset="1826043">This was a young man, who had been over the Mississippi, who had involved himself in the marches of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.263" offset="1852374">Had been arrested to Civil Rights Act, had gone down and tried to join the army at one point and they wouldn't take him because he'd been arrested to Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.469" offset="1885288">They didn't have the rest on this record but he's good enough to be drafted and he's good enough to be drafted by a Board with the president of the Ku Klux Klan only.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.263" offset="1928443">Now, what kind of consideration is he going to get from that kind of a board?</text>
            <text syncTime="461.054" offset="1947564">Nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.230" offset="1952266">And if he has an appeal he wants to this Board, he has a reconsideration of his case to be made to that board and he did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.968" offset="1983195">What do you think that board is going to think about him?</text>
            <text syncTime="472.363" offset="1992808">You read the minutes in this record with how the Board treats policemen, firemen, people that come in there that work for union (Inaudible) that have people go in far.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.626" offset="2033873">He comes in with his mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.211" offset="2040247">He says, “For the first time in my life, I have a good job.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.381" offset="2056861">I work for the part of the agency, I make $275.00 a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.092" offset="2071698">I give $70.00 every two weeks to my mother and when -- this is what he needed to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.076" offset="2099702">This is what he was telling that happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.885" offset="2106911">Do you think the Board paid any attention to that?</text>
            <text syncTime="503.390" offset="2116942">Twice, even his employer went down and said, “Look, he's working with the poor in the city of New Orleans.”</text>
            <text syncTime="508.540" offset="2137527">It's more important, we think than to work in that lower ninth board with the black poor that it his family be down, no.</text>

            <text syncTime="576.319" offset="2408678">I say, I think, I put it on page 33.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.706" offset="2430203">I said, actually they reopened this case Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.292" offset="2448488">I say, they reopened it when they took that first letter of April 27, that's the number three or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.852" offset="2474820">I say, that they did do this to show in all likelihood the Board made a perfectly reasonable assumption that a 20-year old youth who finds himself with the first real steady job in his life will be compelled by his conscience to help support his mother and six brothers and sisters who her mother had been deserted by his father many years before.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.446" offset="2549112">And I say that this was a change in circumstances to this young man and it was in effect because he had to support these children, that it was beyond his control.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.414" offset="2585057">Now, I see nothing in the reason in that interpretation of 1625.2 and certainly we have to recognize that he was impelled to a certain course of action and he was fulfilling his responsibilities to his family.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.195" offset="2640123">And I say that when that sort of thin happens and he goes right through every remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="785.131" offset="3243865">He was properly classified 1-A at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.205" offset="3252224">He was a young man who dropped out school.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.848" offset="3262777">He was not supporting anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.092" offset="3271764">He was properly -- so there was no need to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.094" offset="3283780">So that can't be said to be a reason below.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.144" offset="3299976">It doesn't relate at all to the composition of this boy.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.302" offset="3320560">Then I have to point to the Court most respectfully, this man had no way of knowing who his chairman was, what his activities were.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.496" offset="3349400">He had no way of knowing whether that Board was segregated or whether it was -- had any negroes on or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.630" offset="3377925">He asked to go before the Board and at one time, he was tentatively promised a chance to go before that Board but they took it back, they wouldn't let him go, so he had never laid eyes in the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.203" offset="3424214">But -- so I say again that how could he know.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.138" offset="3455875">We didn't know half of this case until we started discovering it in the criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.524" offset="3473429">There was no way we could either get the information ahead of a criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.489" offset="3489311">As appears those records in the middle of the trial that bring him in and you see how this Board operates.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.895" offset="3510941">They couldn't even remember whether they imposed on these cases or not?</text>
            <text syncTime="856.599" offset="3529749">I don't think they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.676" offset="3546049">But then, what I -- I think the whole thing is of appease.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.071" offset="3563708">It was a board and constitutionally made up.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.886" offset="3578964">It was a board because it is unconstitutional character.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.303" offset="3592547">It was unable to function as a system once says that it has to function in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.055" offset="3619610">It was -- It's clear from the results that the Board achieved in this case that it was not the kind of Board that we ought to have sitting on these kind of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.735" offset="3662346">That the system had somehow already been mismanaged and that the result is what you might expect, a perfectly valid hardship deferment by staff and a young man being sent to five years in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.698" offset="3722115">That to me, is indicative of what happens when the constitutional structures are ignored in the composition of these Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.339" offset="3752730">No governor of the State of Louisiana and there was 25 years as ever recommend a negro to serve on any of these Boards and we all know it.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.041" offset="3787525">Judge Christenberry who tried this case he knew.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.978" offset="3799333">He knew the Board was all white, he said so and it would have been able to get more records because it could have gone further back in five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.324" offset="3828694">That's all the records they had available to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.620" offset="3841860">So I say to the Court, we can't waive something we don't know about and we can't waive something that is constitutional and we cant be held to be able to be put in jail by these kind of boards when we're raising constitutional issues and the court below has simply say, “Well, if you don't dot every eye and cross everything, and be very technical with the way you handle yourself before these boards, they you're going to go jail and you're going to go to jail even though that Board is.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.735" offset="3962337">No more competent that's in that Board to the army and it would beat us this court somewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.446" offset="3993161">Just an incompetent board in kind and they expect him -- in the Government's brief they say, he's suppose to read all these regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.130" offset="4031927">He's supposed to read the code of federal regulations which says, you know, certain things about the way he's suppose to handle his hardships.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.292" offset="4060557">For he's suppose to tell the board about it ten days after, he gets the jobs, he's suppose to tell them.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.865" offset="4082813">If you didn't tell them he waives.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.654" offset="4090023">But how the heck is he going to 1636?</text>
            <text syncTime="998.931" offset="4099114">Well, it's ten days with paycheck, ten days where he gives his money to his mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.205" offset="4120221">He comes, go -- he goes in there and tells the Board about it but what does he get?</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.690" offset="4138088">He gets this kind of a board giving him a fast shuffle and that's what he got.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.504" offset="4157419">So, I respectfully submit to the Court that we can't be held the way of the constitutional issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.930" offset="4179048">This man has got to be given his day in court and he's going to be able to get up and tell that jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.313" offset="4204648">Look, this is -- or tell that judge effectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.949" offset="4215202">Look, this is a bad Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.247" offset="4224397">It's a really white board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.105" offset="4231816">It's doesn't understand many premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.659" offset="4237981">Incompetent to sit on my case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.355" offset="4248743">It's got a bad chairman and they can't deny it in appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.349" offset="4268805">He can't waive those kinds of issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.976" offset="4279254">I don't think -- it's unconscionable for a system to say to this man, “You're going to jail and you're going to jail and you can't raise constitutional issues about it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.033" offset="4315512">He's going to go now and he's going to now for five years.</text>

            <text syncTime="1338.846" offset="5458735">I find myself in somewhat of a wondering the way to approach the argument in this case because it seems to me that petitioner has ignored what is really crucial to the case that is before this Court and that is the vital role that is played in the Selective Service System by the provision embodied in the regulations that once a notice of induction is sent to a registrant, the local board is precluded from reviewing that registrant's classification unless it finds that there has been a change in circumstances since the time that notice was mailed?</text>

            <text syncTime="1382.703" offset="5634173">To review briefly the facts here, a petitioner who had been a student, dropped out of school in December of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.517" offset="5669491">On January 19th, 1966, he was reclassified 1-A.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.747" offset="5694360">On January 28th, 1966, he was ordered to report of physical examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.402" offset="5716929">On February 23rd, he did not appear on that date because he says that he overslept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.364" offset="5744828">The physical was rescheduled for a date of March 14th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.738" offset="5762278">He appeared on that date and was found physically accepted -- acceptable for service and was then on April 13th, 1966 ordered to report for induction on May 20th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.609" offset="5813791">Our petitioner contends and here that as of January 19th, 1966, the date he was classified 1-A, there was no other classification in which he could be put.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.645" offset="5869902">He says that he wasn't working, the record is not clear on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.362" offset="5884844">He started to work some time in January according to the record but the exact date was never clarified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.955" offset="5907205">The petitioner's position is that that classification was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.475" offset="5925282">I would clarify one point here that that is the only time as far as we know that anything in the record that Mr. Helm was the man that they claim as the clansman that had any connection with the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.076" offset="5975646">All the minutes of Board meetings after that date indicate that he was not present and it had been our assumption that he had gone off the Board in some intervening time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.897" offset="6006993">But in any event, petitioner says that January classification is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.039" offset="6031548">So therefore, the time the Board issued its notice to report for induction April 13th and all the information before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.463" offset="6077210">The petitioner was rightfully classified 1-A and he was therefore physically -- found physically acceptable and he was therefore a proper person to be ordered to report for induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.470" offset="6121200">And he was so ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.216" offset="6132276">All of the information which the petitioner now contends show that he was entitled to a deferment here because of the hardship that would be involved to his mother and brothers and sisters by his induction or because of his occupation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.653" offset="6189955">None of the these information was brought to the Board's attention prior to the time that notice to report for induction was sent although petitioner can see that at the trial and I think concedes here that these facts did exist prior to the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.926" offset="6255052">The notice to report for induction was sent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.792" offset="6266546">So that it is clear, we have here a situation which totally fits with any exact provision of 1625.2 whether it has not been the change in circumstances of the registrant, subsequent to the mailing of the notice to report for induction and therefore the Board is precluded by the regulations from reopening the classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.028" offset="6367483">It is the Government's contention here that petitioner's failure to bring to the Court's attention the fact relating to his hardship claim or his claim to an occupational deferment at a time when the Board could have conceded the merits of those claims was in fact a failure to exhaust his administrative remedies which therefore precluded the courts from passing on the validity of his classification at the time he was ordered to report for induction and the time he failed to submit to induction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1675.210" offset="6804250">Had he done so, the Board under the regulations could have considered the facts and if they found that the facts if true would warrant the classification which he was suggesting he's entitled to.</text>

            <text syncTime="1802.897" offset="7314996">1-A classification was proper and there was no basis on which it could have been challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.861" offset="7334849">That therefore, the court below was right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.837" offset="7350732">There had been a failure to exhaust these administrative remedies by not bringing to the local board's attention in its seizable -- at a seizeable time, those factors which he claimed authorize a change in its classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.185" offset="7408097">I think that this regulation is an important vital that's within the framework of the Selective Service System.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.268" offset="7432443">I think it embodies a principle that the necessity which is self-evident that there has to come a time in the Selective Service System when those who were charged with meeting draft boarders on a month-to-month basis, can no with assurance that a classification is final and that a person classified at 1-A at that particular time will in fact be available to report for induction on the day schedule that he's mailed the notice to report for induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.047" offset="7559607">It seems evident if the local board has to have a 100 men to report to induction on May 20th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.685" offset="7582072">They have to go through all these, find those people classified 1-A, look at their file and make sure that that classification is proper and then send to those 100 people a notice to report for induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.344" offset="7636720">If after that notice, to report for induction is sent, those 100 people could each come in and say now, “Wait a minute, there are other claims I want to make as to my classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.635" offset="7681964">I want a deferment for hardship because my occupation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.798" offset="7706520">Then the Board will have no way of guaranteeing that it wouldn't meet its commitment to the military service of this country to provide 100 men to be inducted and I think this is why this regulation is vital and it is why I think it is a reasonable regulation within the Selective Service System.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.766" offset="7778408">I think it is also interesting to note that this cut-off date is not only of the time a notice to report for induction is sent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.040" offset="7819577">It's one that is not only embodied in the regulations but it's one that Congress itself recognized in enacting the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.885" offset="7850924">It provided that it Section 6(a) of the Act, that any person who prior to the issuance of orders for him to report for induction, enlists or accepts appointment in the ready reserve shall be deferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.409" offset="7916962">Congress recognized with respect to reservist also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.284" offset="7932531">Yes, there is an interest in deferring reservist but there has to come a time when the classification is final and people can be bordered up and expected to report and they as the -- Congress and the statute as in the regulations set that time as when the notice to report for induction is mailed to the registrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.314" offset="8024586">So I think that if that registrant -- if that regulation is as we submit a constitutional one, authorized by the statute, then the local board at the time Mr. Duvernay came to present his claims was precluded from acting on those claims and therefore he cannot now contend that the action of the board in denying those claims was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.731" offset="8146317">It was in fact proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.468" offset="8153213">It had a basis in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.252" offset="8160423">His classification was based on the facts as of the time the notice to report for induction was sent to him and the Board acting pursuant to the regulation, could do nothing else but maintain that classification.</text>

            <text syncTime="3087.035" offset="12451506">He can take that to an appeal board and if they are unsuccessful -- if he's unsuccessful there, he can either if it's a split decision taken to the presidential appeal board, or either the state director or national director can take that decision to the presidential appeal board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.033" offset="12523499">I think this is something that is important also to consider that let us assume for a minute a man who was improperly classified who knows that a negro -- who knows that a negro has been excluded from his board, what can he do?</text>
