            <text syncTime="45.429" offset="285132">This is-- the grant of certiorari here is to review a judgment of the Second Circuit which affirmed a narcotics conviction, a rather notable narcotics conviction, as I think Your Honors know.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.784" offset="338526">It involved the largest shipment of pure heroin ever captured in this country, familiarly known as the Trench Deep Freeze case.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.591" offset="381785">The narcotics were brought over by whoever brought them, secreted in a hollowed out deep freeze structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.425" offset="417102">Now, our men, our petitioners all have very heavy jail sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.044" offset="451584">The shortest sentence is 10 years, that's Sutera.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.321" offset="468616">Dioguardi has 15 years, Desist has 18 years, and the two French defendants, Nebbia and LeFranc, have 20 years and a $5,000-fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.715" offset="514278">I'm purposely emphasizing the sentences and another factor, which I will mention in a moment, at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.235" offset="540296">I'm emphasizing at the outset for reasons that I will mention momentarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.789" offset="566523">These men have now served about, let's see, Nebbia and LeFranc have been sitting in jail since about the end of December of 1965, the year that this situation was broken open.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.252" offset="616364">So they're in now nearly three years, and the other-- the others, that is Dioguardi, Sutera, and Desist, were out on bale for awhile and then they've been in for a little over two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.297" offset="676551">The Government has the heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.672" offset="686059">This heroin was not marketed.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.407" offset="697031">The Government has the batch.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.725" offset="706226">And, the Government now has, paid out by these men, a certain amount of jail service.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.561" offset="729631">I'm mentioning that because we all know that, in the briefing over the question of retroactivity of Katz in this case, the government has expressed concern that there will be something alarming to the sense of law enforcement in giving this type of defendant the benefit of a case like the Katz case on retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.071" offset="823672">So, I'm saying that it isn't, all together, a dead loss in realistic down the earth day to day law enforcement policy terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.187" offset="864110">The government has the heroin and the men have served-- well, they've all already served a good bit of jail time.</text>

            <text syncTime="224.467" offset="1001200">He, according to the government's theory, was told one night to unpack it and he had it unpacked and, in suitcases, and felt very gingerly about it and want to be rid of it, and he was rid of it pretty quickly -- the police came and got it.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.042" offset="1067551">None of the defendants, who are the petitioners here, have been-- are shown to have had any contact with this heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.918" offset="1107048">Condor, of course, says that Desist supplied him with the deep freeze and then hollowed it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.406" offset="1137037">He-- well, there-- isn't even definite if Desist hollowed out the deep freeze, but except for that context of Desist with the alleged preparation of the structure there is no-- this isn't even a possession case, incidentally, not to that matters at this stage, I know, but it may be of interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="519.894" offset="2182980">And, that brief is largely devoted to arguing that Katz did not make new law, but that Katz merely gave expression to preexisting Fourth Amendment law.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.938" offset="2227075">If that analysis is correct, this analysis I've just offered, if that's correct, there is no retroactivity problem here at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.027" offset="2255496">It becomes rather like the situation is Stovall where Mr. Justice Fortas, in his separate opinion in Stovall, noted that he would not have reached the -- he would not reach the retroactivity issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.511" offset="2313383">He would treat the issue as one of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.323" offset="2328639">In other words, preexisting due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.751" offset="2338356">We're not making new law that requires a painful decision on retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.686" offset="2358105">We're simply applying the law as it existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.323" offset="2372629">And, I will invite Your Honors to focus especially on a rereading of Katz.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.933" offset="2399065">When you undertake your own deliberation and study on the case, read Katz closely please to see whether I'm not right that it's not a retroactivity decision at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="622.887" offset="2594879">Mr. Chief Justice, in the Yutangco argument, as reported in the Criminal Law Reporter a few weeks ago, the Solicitor General said that -- something about that what the men in Katz did, the agents did, was legal at the time they did it and Your Honor said, “Well, then, if that were so, wouldn't we have abided by precedent?”</text>
            <text syncTime="646.386" offset="2688920">I think it's one of those -- anyway, Your Honor was apparently suggesting to the Solicitor General there that Katz merely stated the -- what Katz says is what the law always was.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.509" offset="2769377">Now, there are other reasons why we don't -- we, the petitioners, consider that we do not stand or fall, our fate does not depend upon the question of retroactivity or prospectivity of Katz.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.328" offset="2848684">There is --there is a whole other half of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.539" offset="2869478">We contend that what the government did, what the narcotic agents did, in the electronic eavesdropping which, by the way, was done at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.367" offset="2904795">I don't think I have mentioned that yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.826" offset="2914722">At the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in December 1965, narcotic agents installed an electronic type of listening device in a room adjoining a room occupied by petitioner Nebbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.381" offset="2972923">Then, over the next couple of days, the agents heard various things which were testified to at the trial and which if believed, were damaging.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.422" offset="3017017">Now, the agents say that they put their bug in their own room rather than in Nebbia's room and that they didn't penetrate Nebbia's enclosure or close in anyway, that they laid the microphone, the listening device, at the bottom of the door of their own room where there was a small aperture.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.325" offset="3128717">Then, beyond that door was an air space of a few inches and then a door Nebbia's room, the typical double door arrangement that you get in some of the better class hotels.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.614" offset="3165811">The agents claim, in other words, a completely non-trespassory and non-physically intrusive type of monitoring.</text>

            <text syncTime="1614.503" offset="6561416">Now, we have thought, in our brief and in petitioner's brief here before, this question has been briefed extensively and we have thought that this was the central issue involved in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.361" offset="6612825">I still think it is, as I understand it, petitioner's contention is that Katz itself somehow decided this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.202" offset="6660159">Now, I don't quite know whether that's what he means or whether he's simply saying that the law always was that way and, in light of some suggestions made from this end of the bench, it seems to me that's fairly close to the accepted common law theory which the Court in Linkletter and subsequent decisions found it was not bound to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.679" offset="6750124">Well, it seems to me, that doesn't advance the inquiry here very far because the question is whether this is one of those situations in which the approach taken in Linkletter and in Stovall and Johnson and Tehan and several other cases per curiam should be followed, that is, that a decision changing a constitutional rule of criminal procedure should not, for a variety of considerations, be given retroactive effect to prior cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2054.835" offset="8322696">I have not had an opportunity to study this joint supplemental reply brief that was filed over the weekend but, as I understand it from a quick reading, there are some discussion there that, while they do admit that -- petitioners do admit that the Fuller decision may cause them some difficulties, the suggestion is that, because a statute was involved and not the Fourth Amendment and because a telegram and not a telephone, that somehow this makes it different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.286" offset="8444531">It seems to me that what the Court said in Fuller was that all of the considerations that have been developed in the previous cases are applicable in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.305" offset="8496567">The purpose, it said, is to enforce a federal law, purpose is delineated in the Linkletter opinion of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule, of course Katz is a Fourth Amendment case and developed some exclusionary rule itself, is to deter police from acting in an unconstitutional matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.176" offset="8584025">And, it's clear that if that's the purpose, that purpose can't be served by retroactively invalidating convictions that have been based upon evidence obtained which, under the new rule, would have been inadmissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.308" offset="8644629">So, I think that the Fuller case is quite pertinent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2717.984" offset="10975274">That's correct, but I see -- it seems to me, there's no compulsion involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.289" offset="10996485">It's been suggested that somehow this is an involuntary confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.518" offset="11013413">We don't quite understand that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.164" offset="11024071">I don't know that he was compelled to do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.953" offset="11083212">I would like to turn just for a moment to the -- his repeated references to the President's directive of June 13, 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.236" offset="11140368">Petitioners have referred to this repeatedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.132" offset="11151862">The only reason that it has not been made public is that it was specifically indicated by the White House that it should be an internal government matter and kept confidential.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.329" offset="11200658">All of us who have worked with these series of cases, Schipani and Black and whatever in this case, and the Attorney General in promulgating the directives that he is promulgated are completely familiar with what the directive says and what it requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.655" offset="11265964">In the main, it discusses wire tapping.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.872" offset="11282892">It discusses electronic surveillance only in a short and passing way, and simply directs that the Attorney General and the other agencies be ensured that the federal government and all of its agencies are acting in compliance with the existing law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.566" offset="11361677">Now, we've acted consistently on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.543" offset="11377560">We have informed the Court in any situations involving trespassory bugging and, it seems to us, that the whole things has much to do about nothing and, it seems to me, inconceivable that the Attorney General and the Solicitor General, the Department of Justice, indeed the whole federal law enforcement establishment would've acted all these time inconsistent and in conflict with the presidential directive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.627" offset="11485915">It's simply not so, and I don't know what else really can be said about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.631" offset="11509948">I would like to turn to several of the arguments made by petitioner that are really subsidiary in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.711" offset="11538265">One of them is, he views it as a fairly important argument, he says that even if you hold Katz to be retroact -- non-retroactive so that the Katz does not apply to his case, the bugging here was in violation of existing law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.153" offset="11616005">But, we don't quite understand that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.675" offset="11622066">He seeks to get something out of the Osborne case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.156" offset="11635963">The Osborne case, in the first place, was decided after the bugging occurred here but, more importantly, in Osborne, all that -- as we understand the Court to have done was to say that it was unnecessary to wrestle with the question of whether Lopez was still good law because in the Osborne situation there was judicial sanction for the recording which is, as Your Honors recall, was what was involved there of a conversation engaged in by the defendant and another person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.775" offset="11762500">So, it seems to me that Osborne doesn't advance the inquiry anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.518" offset="11777442">He suggested somehow Silverman decided all of these.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.485" offset="11789354">Well, in Silverman, the Court specifically refused to reconsider the question of whether Goldman and Olmstead were still good law and found it unnecessary to do so because it found a physical intrusion there and the Court, of course, has, as Your Honors know, concluded that it would not extend to Goldman even by a fraction of an inch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.300" offset="11876603">But, it seems to us that it's quite clear that the Court was still talking in terms of his trespass distinction in Silverman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.433" offset="11909099">Now, further, it seems to me, indication that the law that existed prior to Katz was as we say it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.127" offset="11943894">All of the Courts -- lower Courts understood it to be this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.218" offset="11956224">We've cited a number of Court of Appeals decisions would seek to apply this distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.572" offset="11977644">We cited them “e.g.” because there are many more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.407" offset="11993004">And, in these, the Court denied certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.647" offset="12005961">All these, occurring during the time prior to Katz, but in the Berger case itself in which the Court decided that New York's dropping statute was not sufficiently precise and definite to be upheld constitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.970" offset="12087254">The Court there said in its opinion, repeatedly referred to trespassory intrusions, and that it could not allow a statute that was that broad and that sweeping and that ill-defined to be a basis for sanctioning trespassory intrusions into constitutionally protected areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.294" offset="12168547">Now, that was written six months before Katz and it seems to us that it reflected the Court's view and notion of existing law at that time, and I can understand why the Court would say that in Berger if that was in its understanding of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.629" offset="12237928">So, it seems to me that petitioners are off-base when they suggest that the activity engaged in here was somehow unlawful and that preexisting law, back to some point in time that I'm not clear about, already had presaged the Katz's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.541" offset="12317550">There are a variety of subsidiary issues that petitioners have raised in the main.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.198" offset="12340120">I should like to leave them to our discussion in the brief, but I would like to make passing mention of some of them because it seems to us, in light of the Court's granting certiorari without limit, we have an obligation to respond to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.855" offset="12406784">Petitioner suggests that the remand hearing here was inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.622" offset="12425906">As the Court will recall, after the Schipani procedure which the government here did follow, contrary to petitioner's intonations, there was discovered several other instances of electronic activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.083" offset="12491734">One, related to one -- only one of the petitioners had occurred in Miami some-four years before the bugging here and it -- he was not the subject of the surveillance but he was overheard in a Miami restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.680" offset="12554115">The conspiracy here was not formed until several months before the heroin was discovered and petitioners were arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.480" offset="12589328">This conversation had absolutely nothing to do with the matters involved here and was wholly irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.868" offset="12618794">The only other instance was in Columbus, Georgia when they were following these people around because they were trying to make this transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.565" offset="12657664">There was an attempt to put a radio transmitter in a rented car.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.935" offset="12679084">The thing didn't work and they heard absolutely nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.544" offset="12697579">The remand hearing was limited to those two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.307" offset="12712626">However, the judge did allow petitioners to put on several witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.221" offset="12728299">Those witnesses testified in various ways that some kind of bad things were happening down there in Columbus, but when they were cross-examined they backed off and, finally, the Court determined that they simply weren't credible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.921" offset="12783052">Other questions that he raises, he says that as to t -- at least two of the petitioners, although he challenges the sufficiency of the evidence generally, he says as particularly as to two, Mr. Dioguardi and Mr. Sutera, the evidence was wholly inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.163" offset="12839999">Well, it seems to us, again, this is a matter for lower Courts to resolve.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.159" offset="12855986">The findings of fact here, concurred in by both Courts, are that the evidence was adequate, that these people were involved in the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.584" offset="12885661">They engaged in an extensive conversation in a restaurant New York that was overheard, not electronically, overheard by agents sitting at a bar in which the clear intendment is that they were to either receive the narcotics directly or to be the agents for those people that were receiving the narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.476" offset="12965282">It seems to us that that's a matter for the Court and the jury to resolve, and they resolved it against petitioner, but he continues to assert that it's a question that ought to be resolved up here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.342" offset="13016691">There's a question raised as to the adequacy of how the tape was translated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.016" offset="13035395">I'm running out of time and I'll simply mention these questions in passing and respectfully request the Court to refer to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.150" offset="13067995">It seems to us that, there, the Court gave petitioners more than enough opportunity to ensure that an adequate translation was made and there was no need to have, as they have suggested now, a simultaneous translator that somehow was listening to it and reading it to the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="3577.677" offset="14414033">The Kolod-Alderisio problem in our case would exist only in relation to the Florida bugging.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.432" offset="14453112">We agree with the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.339" offset="14456769">There's no real issue on Florida, but there is a very severe issue, we say, in connection with an allegedly abortive additional bugging in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.230" offset="14500342">I haven't spoken of that today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.592" offset="14505775">We've briefed it pretty completely, and I would ask the Court to watch for that item since there was some animation here at the end about the Kolod problem which I think it is currently before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.596" offset="14577768">Now --</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="3619.365" offset="14580799">Well, they didn't get -- they didn't make any tapes at all or get any recordings, did they, in that second incident to which you refer?</text>

          <turn speaker="abraham_glasser" startTime="3627.814" stopTime="3807.271">
            <label>Mr. Abraham Glasser</label>
            <text syncTime="3627.814" offset="14614653">They -- the agent who ran it said he didn't get the tape, and I think one other agent who was in the car with him said they didn't get any effective audible results.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.293" offset="14668570">But, again, we had a very hard pushing hearing in which I, for one, can wait, feeling that I was entitled to make a strong appellate point against the credibility of those agents on that issue too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.313" offset="14744639">And, indeed, on that issue above all, they were crawling all over that part of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.689" offset="14766164">They were there about to score, and they were not hesitating to bug.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.889" offset="14778911">They were bugging all over the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.730" offset="14786330">We think we can't prove that they were bugging in Europe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.863" offset="14798869">These fellows lived with bugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.666" offset="14810049">It's incredible to me that they didn't have more than that one abortive car bug in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.890" offset="14830947">They must have bugged Desist's room.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.436" offset="14837112">I'm speaking of perhaps -- well, all right, I'll drop that point for now because it's been thoroughly briefed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.919" offset="14866996">Our whole submission is sufficiently stated in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.629" offset="14897925">Now, on Fuller, again, may I say something that is -- have been abrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.796" offset="14938572">We think this Court should withdraw its action in Fuller on the ground that certiorari there was improvidently granted and I'd like to say why.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.374" offset="14980890">We've covered it thoroughly in our last brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3723.143" offset="14995937">Fuller involved a telegram, we all know that, but back of that telegram was a subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.068" offset="15027597">The police in Fuller were not defiant or willful towards existing law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.559" offset="15053615">The police in Fuller went to the Alaska Communications Body, whatever it's called, got voluntary relinquishment of the telegram from that body pursuant to a federal regulation and they also got a subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.883" offset="15122892">Now, the exact details of that whole subpoena picture, I don't know for sure of myself because I haven't seen the Fuller record but I've been guided through it in consultation in clause, consultation with one of the Fuller certiorari counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.819" offset="15186631">I have the page numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.897" offset="15190915">This is covered in our last brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.690" offset="15198124">Now, if there was a subpoena in Fuller for that telegram, how can Your Honors reach the question in Fuller of a violation of 605 because the very first sentence of 605 provides for subpoenas nor, at least colorably and subject to a closer scrutiny of the record in Fuller than -- which Your Honors may well wish to do because Fuller is a pretty drastic decision, and to render a drastic decision like Fuller on a record that may not stand up under scholarly criticism one of these days, I would think would be something that the Court that wish to hear about.</text>
