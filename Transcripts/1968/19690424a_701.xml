            <text syncTime="11.702" offset="150131">When the Court rose yesterday, I had just summarized the three respects in which in our view Gaston County has failed in its proof of showing that the application of literacy test in that jurisdiction had not had either purpose or effect or discriminating against the Negro franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.496" offset="249396">Those were first the failure to show that with respect to municipal elections carried on within the territory of the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.229" offset="284296">Discrimination had not occurred within the preceding five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.286" offset="300492">Second, a failure to rebut if a rebuttal was possible, the inference of discrimination that arises from the fact that white illiterates were registered and the literacy test waived this to them whereas same was not true with respect to Negro.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="72.020" offset="391502">Wasn't there some evidence that Negro illiterates have been registered or am I mistaken?</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="77.410" offset="413027">Mr. Justice Stewart, there was but I think there were nine arguably illiterate negroes who were brought as witnesses of those three may have failed the test for some eye defect rather than because of illiteracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.440" offset="497142">Two had apparently memorized the oath just being under the regime of the oral test which involved reading the oath and to that extent had perhaps deceived the registrar.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.436" offset="545102">They were illiterates and the remaining two or three year seemed to have been true illiterates whose illiteracy may have been known to the registrar.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.792" offset="590555">It is significant that each of these nine witnesses came from precincts 7 in Gastonia, the one area predominantly Negro where the policy of the county authorities seem to have been more lenient toward Negro registration than elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.824" offset="670699">There's no evidence that anywhere else within the jurisdiction of the county are comparable waiver had take advice.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="149.043" offset="699538">It was in that particular precinct in the City of Gastonia where the large majority of the Negroes where county lived, wasn't it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="158.733" offset="738304">One-third of the population of the county of all races lives within that city.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.218" offset="768293">I think less than half of the Negro population lives within the City of Gastonia.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.946" offset="787205">I'm not clear whether those figures are of record or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.362" offset="800789">I think it is clear however that fully have not considerably more live in the rural areas or in other municipalities of the Gastonia.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="183.863" stopTime="195.804">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="183.863" offset="838823">I remember -- I think I remember a figure from the briefs or somewhere that only about 13% of the population of the out of city of the county population is Negro.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="195.804" stopTime="750.756">
            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="195.804" offset="886575">That is -- that is true over all within the county, I think it's actually 12% of the population of Gaston County today is Negro at one time, it seems to have been considerably larger proportionately than it is today.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.152" offset="951986">On the other hand, the waiver for whites was clearly a matter of general practice throughout the county, they were 29 eyewitnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.224" offset="1012276">Well, whose testimony is taken by deposition but who were fairly illiterates, many of them have been visited at their homes it made no effort to register on their own and some at least one notable example the applicant had indicated to the registrar that he didn't want to register and was registered nevertheless.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.616" offset="1113840">Most of them testified that they had informed the registrar that they were illiterate and nevertheless had been registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.603" offset="1145814">In addition to that evidence, the Government introduced registration forms from 70 white applicants which showed them illiterate in the full sense of being unable to even sign their names and the notations there which make it clear the registrar signed for them are sometimes quite candid can't write as the explanation sometimes as an “x” which is unexplained.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.826" offset="1254693">In many instances the notation excusing the applicant from signing is too nervous in some other instances the notation is left glasses at home -- eyeglasses.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.573" offset="1333687">The Government of course, the total here is something like 100, the Government I think reasonably infers from this number who were willing to testify or whose illiteracy was evident from their inability to even sign their names that the practice was quite prevalent and of course in no sense limited to this number who could be found as willing witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.931" offset="1443088">Now, finally and we think Gaston County has failed in its proof by failing to rebut the natural inference resulting from the educational disparity, the lack of equal educational opportunity afforded Negro voters of today when they were school children that the literacy test has borne more heavily on them and would continue to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.475" offset="1577253">I want to make clear that in our view either of the first two grounds is sufficient to support the judgment denying exemption to Gaston County.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.768" offset="1630438">On the other hand, I proposed to focus on the third ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.795" offset="1658546">The reason for that is in part that the failure with respect to proof or concerning municipal elections while the sufficient ground does seem to us to be somewhat tentative one, it's a little -- the tail wagging of the dog.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.345" offset="1736704">It does not come to the heart of the policy of the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.581" offset="1765648">The second ground while again quite sufficient does have a somewhat punitive character and that if in the past three years, Negro illiterates have been afforded full opportunity to come on the rolls, it may be that the registration of white illiterates has in that sense been cured and that the discrimination has in a real sense been largely eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.496" offset="1885393">Now that is not the test under the Act under so long as there has been discrimination within the prior five years, Gaston County would have to wait another two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.305" offset="1932622">But still, it seems to us you get more of the central issue to focus on the ground which is the ground that the District Court, majority of the District Court thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.852" offset="1982777">The sound is on which to base his judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.126" offset="1999914">It is of course also a ground which presents the question of recurring importance which sooner or later will have to come before the court in this case or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.310" offset="2048606">It also has the different consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.336" offset="2060727">This appears on my somewhat inadequate answer to Mr. Justice Stewart yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.959" offset="2087163">Under the Act, after the five years are up and jurisdiction wins the exemption, there is an additional five-year period during which the jurisdiction of the District Court is retained and the Court is instructed to entertain an application by the Attorney General during that period under the same standards as would have applied during the previous five-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.393" offset="2196982">And if the effect of the disparity with respect to education were continuing in the second five-year period, there would then be justification for a suit of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.409" offset="2249017">And that would be, that probability seems likely only with respect to the state ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.438" offset="2285171">So the basis of the judgment may have a very important practical impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.744" offset="2310353">And finally, this third ground looks in one sense to the past that is the educational disparity.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.912" offset="2338983">On the other hand, it quite realistically looks to the future unlikely through the priority grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.282" offset="2364479">In the sense that what is being tested here is whether the discrimination of the past still has a lingering effect and will in years to come for that reason not because the education of disparity has had a discriminatory effect but because it will continue to have for some time to come, it seems to us that this basis for the judgment is the one that ought to be focused on.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.273" offset="2508466">It seems to us also that this ground of position is faithful to the legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.417" offset="2545037">We must remember that at the time the suspension of test was proposed in the Congress, the argument ran that that was an unnecessary radical procedure that it was quite sufficient if the complaint were that the illiterates, white illiterates have been registered and that same privilege with the non-Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.823" offset="2630614">The way to cure that was to require or at least offer the states the alternative of the complete re-registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.457" offset="2661230">The answer made to that suggestion by the Attorney General and reproduce to both committee reports is that -- that would not have solved the problem because the reinstruction of the literacy test would bear more heavily on the Negro voters precisely because they have denied the same educational opportunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.306" offset="2748583">So we're dealing here with a grounded decision which the Congress itself focused on.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.160" offset="2796022">Now I must concede as Justice Stewart pointed out yesterday that the result of this argument is one that the Congress apparently did not fully appreciate at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.125" offset="2871881">But there are several things that are to be said about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.920" offset="2891003">First, the Act is I think I pointed out yesterday does not deal merely with literacy test.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.502" offset="2909393">It also suspends other test which have nothing to do with educational disparities and it also has other provisions with respect to enactment of new laws, sending to federal examiners, federal observers which have nothing to do with his educational disparities.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.347" offset="2988805">Also, five-year period was in the end simply a legislative compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.534" offset="3017540">Congress seem not to have quite focus on what would happen into the five-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.059" offset="3039587">It's rather unthinkable for instance that having allowed thousands of illiterate Negro voters in the South to become registered thanks to this Federal Act, the Congress intended to permit that suddenly they should be purged from the rolls after five years had gone by.</text>

            <text syncTime="785.705" offset="3246164">I think what we must say is that the Congress didn't look that far ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.336" offset="3260688">It assumed that the Act would be extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.652" offset="3269987">All of the courts would intervene and they did provide in this additional five-year period that I was speaking of for the courts to intervene when the Act otherwise expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.448" offset="3317112">And it seems to me that that is the legislative scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.912" offset="3343026">Now, it is perfectly obvious that this literacy test that reinstituted will bear more heavily on the Negro.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.728" offset="3378239">That is true because fewer Negroes went to school at all twice as many Negroes who never went to school in Gaston County.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.745" offset="3414392">It is true because few of them than whites stayed long enough to obtain the necessary literacy again almost twice as many be grosser in that position as whites and that for 30% of the Negroes in Gaston County never got beyond the fourth grade.</text>

            <text syncTime="1041.188" offset="4268074">Result was that 95% of the Negro teacher had second class certificates, whereas, most of the white teachers have first class certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.019" offset="4307466">This Negro education in that day was in large part, in one classroom with all grades taught together.</text>

            <text syncTime="1091.171" offset="4468067">But what we should compare is not high school graduates about races or even elementary school graduates for -- of both races but those who only went to school for one or two or three or four years as to them even the slightest disparity would result in one group being able to past the test and the other not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.218" offset="4552286">And we know as I have just indicated that there are many in that category in Gaston County who were only able of reason or another to attend school for this short-term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.222" offset="4600247">Finally, let me say that the suspension of the test has had though belatedly a very substantial practical impact that has now been a 25% increase in Negro registration in the county out of originally some 4,100 Negroes registered, there are now 5,100 Negro registered, a thousand increased on this small number which is --</text>
