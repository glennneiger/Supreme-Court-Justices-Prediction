            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">Number 8, William Spinelli, petitioner versus the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.248" offset="130445">Mr. Baris you may continue with the argument.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Irl B. Baris</label>
            <text syncTime="10.238" offset="146328">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.891" offset="160956">Yesterday afternoon, I was asked a question I believe by Mr. Justice Fortas and the press of the recess I did not get a chance to complete my question related to the information which I feel is necessary to be included in an affidavit for a search warrant and with particular reference to the previous reliability of the informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.717" offset="260326">I have here a handbook on the Law of Search and Seizure to be distinguished of course from the handbook about which we're kind of talking in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.486" offset="295330">This is a legal handbook, I would say.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.626" offset="311944">This was published very recently by the government and I note that on page four, for instance, these are instructions to law enforcement officers as to what should be included in an affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.772" offset="364502">And they say specifically on page four, and where the informant is undisclosed, you can back up the other person's thrustworthiness by showing prior dealings with him which were reliable to backup your belief that the information he is now giving you is reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.524" offset="435555">At the end of the book, there are several examples of what should be included in affidavits then three of them, I think are particularly noteworthy because they are -- these examples are based upon information by a reliable informant and in the first one it says, informant has given me reliable information on narcotic sales five times within the last four months.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.228" offset="534298">Example number two says informant has provided reliable information about robberies on two occasions during the last three months and example number five says a reliable informant, who has given reliable information on narcotics offenses on three occasions within the last two months.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.480" offset="607336">Now I have also would like to draw the Court's attention to the various cases decided by this Court in which there have been information supplied by informants and I think that in each of those cases where the search warrant has been sustained, there is substantially more than was included in the affidavit that we have in the instant case and then those in which the search warrant was not sustained, we have a comparable situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.858" offset="716842">For example in the McCray case, which was not a search warrant case, but was an arrest without a search warrant, one of the officers testified in support of his probable cause that he had received information from the undisclosed informant on 15 or 16 occasions in the past which resulted in numerous arrests and convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.605" offset="799807">A second officer said that he had received information from his informant on 20 to 25 occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.419" offset="827079">In the Reagan case, which was a per curiam decision of this Court, involving a search warrant in which the search warrant was held to be not good, it merely stated that information from sources believed to be reliable which I consider to be very comparable to what we have here where they set a confidential, reliable informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.006" offset="905446">In the Ventresca case, a search warrant case in which the search warrant was proved, there was no informant involved but only government investigators and I think the government investigators are in a different category from an undisclosed informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.527" offset="975559">In the Beck case, not a search warrant but in which the arrest and the subsequent search was held to be invalid, the officer had information but there was nothing said in his testimony concerning the credibility of the informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.138" offset="1042014">In the Aguilar case, the search warrant, the application said reliable information from a credible person, which I think is practically what we have in this case, again the search warrant was held to be not good.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.406" offset="1099065">In the Rugendorf case, involving a search warrant, there were three informants and as to each of them it says, whom the FBI had found to be reliable or who have furnished reliable information to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the past or who had supplied the FBI with reliable information in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.869" offset="1176910">In the Kerr case, not a search warrant case but involving probable cause on arrest, the informant had previously given information leading to at least three arrests.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.118" offset="1217870">In the Jones case, the second Jones case, the 362 US, the informant gave information on previous occasions which was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.209" offset="1258308">That case was reversed on other grounds although the search warrant was sustained in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.069" offset="1277743">And in the Draper case which was relied upon heavily by the majority opinion of the Court of Appeals in this case and which is relied upon by the government in their brief, there was a special employee of the FBI who had been serving for six months and who gave the information which was found to be -- and had previously given information which was found to be reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.631" offset="1367918">Upon the authority of those cases, it is my contention that merely to say that the informant is a reliable, confidential informant, does not satisfy the requirements of the probable cause, requirement of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.268" offset="1434478">In addition to the other reasons which we have alleged and indicated in our brief, and which we discussed yesterday, I feel also that the search warrant here was improper because the affidavit did not relate the time when the alleged informant gave this information to the government nor when he allegedly obtained this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.556" offset="1535624">There is a case of the United States Court of Appeals of the First Circuit, the Rosencrams case cited in our brief, which says that merely the use of the present tense is not sufficient for these purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="371.900" offset="1592989">What was the lapse of time here in this case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="irl_b_baris" startTime="375.173" stopTime="591.282">
            <label>Mr. Irl B. Baris</label>
            <text syncTime="375.173" offset="1606154">Well your honor, there was nothing said in the affidavit itself and of course, I think the cases hold it that one must, on appeal, govern it by what is in the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.579" offset="1647741">It merely said in the present tense the Federal Bureau of Investigation has received information.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.788" offset="1668535">Now at the hearing on the motion to suppress, there was some testimony that the information had been given in the early part of August, it was no more specific than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.507" offset="1707405">The search warrant was applied for on the 18th of August and was executed on that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.468" offset="1739274">We have also indicated two other points in our brief, one with reference to the fact that more items were seized than the search warrant required.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.132" offset="1781906">The Court of Appeals seemed to justify the seizure of a pencil-sharp narrow radio and adding machine, watch, eyeglasses, all under the general heading of gambling paraphernalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.325" offset="1830703">We feel that to allow any seizure on the ground of gambling paraphernalia makes it a general warrant and is improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.027" offset="1873544">In fact, we were in the anomalous situation that they seized—the search warrant provided for the seizure of two telephones, they seized five and I suppose the government's contention is the two telephones are two telephones but the other three telephones were not telephones but gambling paraphernalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.573" offset="1943761">Now with reference to a final point that we have brought up in our brief, and that is with reference to the execution of the search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.855" offset="1984825">The facts in this case are that immediately after the agents received the search warrant, they apparently went back to their office for certain mechanical equipments and walkie-talkies apparently and then went out to the scene of the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.984" offset="2041354">But instead of breaking into the premises or obtaining entrance into the premises, they went to an apartment next door and waited from 4:55 in the afternoon until 7:05 in the afternoon, a period of two hours and 10 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.567" offset="2099660">They -- so far as the record shows, did nothing during that period of time except to wait and when the petitioner exited from the subject apartment, they then came out of the apartment next door and -- which was right across the hall in fact, and immediately placed the petitioner under arrest and then, by virtue of a key, was they obtained from his possession, went into the subject premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.557" offset="2195686">It is our belief that this is not forth with execution of a search warrant as is required by Rule 4 that forthwith means, under these circumstances, immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.383" offset="2242915">We believe that of course there is the provision in Rule 4 that a search warrant must be executed within a period of 10 days after it's issued, otherwise is it loses its validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.749" offset="2288368">But our position is that where the officers have the search warrant, were at the premises, had everything available to them for getting into the premises including the right under Section 3109 to break the doors, that they should have executed it forthwith.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.708" offset="2360257">Now the Court of Appeals decision has indicated that it was incumbent upon petitioner to show some prejudice resulting from this delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.159" offset="2402053">We have found no case which directly is in point with this particular proposition, except as mentioned in the concurring opinion of Judge Bazelon in the Mitchell case which we have cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.847" offset="2464852">But it is our position --</text>

            <text syncTime="601.140" offset="2509991">Your honor, I don't know that they have not attempted to justify it on that basis throughout this case, I think that perhaps they were giving themselves an opportunity to do so if the government decided to do that on the basis that the search warrant would be held invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.104" offset="2565789">Perhaps, I'm merely speculating as to the government's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.418" offset="2579059">Perhaps, they're giving themselves an ace in the hole, so to speak, that if the search warrant were declared to be invalid, then they would have, as an alternative the question of an arrest and a search incidental to the arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="634.703" offset="2644261">Yes they did make a return on the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.046" offset="2657635">It is our position therefore that the search was not executed forthwith and that the burden is not upon the petitioner to show prejudice because the burden is not on the position to show prejudice, in an instance where, for instance under the Marin case, I believe it is that in which -- no the Wong Tai case, in which, under Section 3109, where the defendant was not required to show prejudice because the officers fail to identify themselves before making the entry into the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.913" offset="2805070">I have reserved the balance of my time for rebuttal if the Court please?</text>

            <text syncTime="687.455" offset="2855225">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.128" offset="2869959">The issue in this case is whether the United States commissioner, reasonably found, on the facts contained in this affidavit, that there is probable cause to search apartment 1108 Indian Circle Drive.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.413" offset="2923039">Petitioner's argument proceeds by separating at each statement in the affidavit and showing wherein that statement fails to supply certain information, which also would be relevant to the commissioners finding the probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.642" offset="2979986">By adding up the alleged deficiencies, petitioner concludes that there was no probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.618" offset="3003914">But that analysis is not fully responsive to the question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.499" offset="3019379">The primary inquiry is not what the affidavit did not contain, but what it did contain.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.258" offset="3042471">Whether there were enough facts on which the commissioner could make his own independent judgment of the grounds for a search, and whether tat judgment on the affidavit taken as a whole, was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.510" offset="3091477">Cause for reversal lies not in whether a judge were on review, would not have issued the warrant because of the absence of certain particular information, but whether there was such a complete lack of information that that the Commissioner's apparent finding was nothing more than a rubber stamp for the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.170" offset="3162112">Petitioner's counsel is discussed what the affidavit did not contain, but I would like to say it out briefly what it did contain.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.765" offset="3188443">It stated that the FBI had received information from a confidential, reliable informant, that petitioner was operating a handbook and accepting wagering information over two specified telephone numbers, way down 40029 and way down 40136.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.348" offset="3258765">It stated the petitioner is known to Agent Bender, who was the affiant, to other federal agents and to local police as a bookmaker and as a gambler.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.287" offset="3294605">It also showed the results of the agent's own investigation, to corroborate the information which had been received.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.884" offset="3320936">It said that the telephone company record showed that both telephone specified by the informant, were in operation and that both of them were located in apartment F, at 1108 Indian Circle Drive, under the name of Grace Hagen.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.693" offset="3376212">It showed the petitioner had been under surveillance by the FBI during the three weeks preceding the application for the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.581" offset="3403692">When the four consecutive business days he was followed, he drove from Illinois into St. Louis in the early morning, and then roughly at the same time every afternoon, he drove out to Olivette, Missouri, a suburb some 30 minutes drive from downtown St. Louis and went to apartment F at 1108 Indian Circle Drive.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.371" offset="3486866">The apartment whiched contain the two telephones specified by the informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.292" offset="3506615">This affidavit answered the commissioner's hypothetical question, what makes you think that there is bookmaking going on in apartment F?</text>
            <text syncTime="858.334" offset="3538798">Agent Bender replied, "Because I received specific information from a reliable informant about a bookmaking operation by an individual whom I know to be a bookmaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.019" offset="3581534">And because I verified that information by my own investigation and by the observations of petitioner's conduct."</text>

            <text syncTime="918.492" offset="3779438">Well, the incriminating aspect of it Mr. Chief Justice is that that apartment contained the two telephones specified by the informant, that he was a known bookmaker, and that a known bookmaker making regular visits to an apartment with two telephones, itself provide some suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.366" offset="3850909">Now I'm not saying that that conduct, that observed conduct by itself would be at all sufficient to satisfy probable cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2385.308" offset="9646644">The Court's opinion, written by Mr. Justice Goldberg, who was the author of the opinion in Aguilar, stated that where an affidavit sets out facts on which the magistrate can make an independent determination of the grounds for a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.470" offset="9699307">The Court should not set aside the magistrate's finding of probable cause by interpreting the affidavit in a hyper technical, rather than a common sense manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.430" offset="9739118">The Court recognized in Ventresca, as it did in Jones, that in the circumstances in which affidavits are normally drafted by policemen in the midst of a criminal investigation and without legal assistance if the affidavit is bound to leave some questions unanswered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.727" offset="9804319">The affidavit here does not answer all the questions which might have occurred to the commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.934" offset="9825113">He would have been more confident in his finding if he had been told to the extent to which the informant had provided accurate information of the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.768" offset="9856460">He may have been curious as to whether the agents had been able to determine the volume of calls to the two telephones or whether there really was a Grace Hagen for other questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.618" offset="9895852">But the teaching of Ventresca is that the affidavit's failure to supply certain facts is fatal only if it undermines the reasonableness of the inferences which may be drawn from the facts which the affidavit does continue, or put it another way, only if the inference is rest to heavily on the officer's good faith, rather than the magistrate's own independent judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.559" offset="9987699">The critical issue in this case is the thrustworthiness of the hearsay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.180" offset="10002119">The corroborating information of the affidavit provided a basis in which the commissioner defined the hearsay thrustworthy without relying on the agent's good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.784" offset="10040571">The reasonableness of that finding is not undermined by the defects which petitioner alleges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.052" offset="10065648">The court in Ventresca also cautioned that a grudging where negative attitude by reviewing boards to award warrants, will tend to discourage police officers from submitting their evidence to a judicial officer before acting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.943" offset="10117162">The concern which prompted that statement, I believe is illustrated by the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.671" offset="10140150">We believe that Agent Bender did have at least a reasonable option to decide whether to go get a search warrant or to go in on the basis of the information he had without a warrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="3210.034" offset="12945596">Now bear in mind that in Aguilar, what we have is an allegation by an informant of the commission of a federal offense, to with the possession of narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.363" offset="12990840">Here, the only thing that the informant said is an allegation of the commission of a state offense, the operation of a handbook.</text>
