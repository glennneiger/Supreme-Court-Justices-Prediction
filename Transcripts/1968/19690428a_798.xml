            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="33.890" offset="238947">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.750" offset="258382">This is a school desegregation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.861" offset="278862">The question arises here however with respect to faculty desegregation rather than directly with student desegregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.244" offset="328391">The issue is a rather narrow but important one.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.453" offset="349184">It arises with respect to the schools of Montgomery County, Alabama including not only those in the City of Montgomery but also those in the surrounding county area.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.678" offset="414072">For the 1967-1968 school year, the defendants operated 52 schools including 32 predominantly white and 20 predominantly Negro schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.781" offset="494529">There were approximately 22,500 white students and 17,000 Negro students taught by approximately 815 white teachers and 550 Negro teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.035" offset="587525">This suit began with a complaint which was filed on May 11, 1964 almost five years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.362" offset="640815">At that time as the District Court stated in its opinion and this is at page 524 of the printed record, the Montgomery County Board of Education had taken no steps and had made no plans whatsoever to comply with the law of this land in the area of school desegregation even though ten years had passed when this matter came on for a hearing in 1964, the Montgomery County Board of Education was allowed by this Court to proceed with desegregation gradually for the reason that it was realized that desegregation of the public schools cut across the social fabric of this community and that there would be both administrative and other practical problems for the Board to cope with.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.912" offset="886993">And the Court went on to show the way in which it had helped to cooperate with the Board and moving forward in this and concluded however we have reached the point where we must pass tokenism and the order that was entered in this case on February 24, 1968 is designed to accomplish this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.010" offset="1003395">It was not designed to and was not intended to accomplish and if complied with will not require more than the Supreme Court of the United States and the other appellate courts have held must be accomplished in order to desegregate a public school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.700" offset="1090121">Well, now what had been done since the suit was filed in 1964, in the year 1964-65, as a result of an order of the Court entered on July 31, 1964, the Board permitted transfers under the Alabama school placement law in four grades, grade 1 and grades 10, 11, and 12, being the senior high school.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.412" offset="1237034">This order did not affect the system of initial assignments on the basis of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.496" offset="1265351">The Board accepted eight of 29 Negroes who applied to transfer to traditionally white schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.132" offset="1307878">Two students withdrew their applications and the Board denied the remaining 19 applications, so that during the first year, there were eight Negro students in what had previously been white schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.247" offset="1380394">In 1965-66, grades 1, 2, 7, and 9 through 12 were to be desegregated, 49 Negro students applied to attend predominantly white schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.285" offset="1452492">The defendants rejected applications from 31 of these and accepted 18 applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.152" offset="1488018">On appeal to the Court, the Court overturned six of the rejections but accepted the remainder.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.272" offset="1528456">This made 24 students who were admitted to the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.653" offset="1558026">In 1966-67, approximately 330 Negro students chose to attend white school -- traditionally white schools in Montgomery County, no white students chose to attend traditionally Negro schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.220" offset="1640260">This was the first year that the school board operated under a freedom of choice plan without initial assignment on the basis of race except in the two grades which were not yet covered by the desegregation plan which were grades 5 and 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.043" offset="1727509">In the year 1967-68 was the first year that all 12 grades were to be formally desegregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.138" offset="1767946">Approximately, 550 Negro students attended traditionally white schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.539" offset="1801488">No white students attended Negro schools and in the year 1968-69, the current year, there are approximately 950 Negro students in 30 traditionally white schools and approximately 16,500 or 94% in all Negro schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.734" offset="1922278">There are no white students in Negro schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.527" offset="1945475">So that in summary, as of today, no white student has ever attended a traditionally Negro school in Montgomery County.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.935" offset="1995107">The number of Negro students attending traditionally white schools has slowly increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.257" offset="2024364">Until the present time, it is 950 which seem like a substantial number but it is less than 6% of the Negro students in the Montgomery County school system.</text>

          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="571.256" stopTime="1695.851">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="571.256" offset="2388407">The complaint in this case, as I have said, was filed on May 11, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.340" offset="2416724">In it, the plaintiff sought faculty desegregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.659" offset="2438040">The Court's first order made no specific reference to faculty desegregation but it did require the defendants to submit a plan designed to eliminate segregation of students based upon race and the complete elimination of the biracial school system within a reasonable time.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.871" offset="2538872">The defendant's first segregation plan was submitted in January 1965 and it was sound as to faculty desegregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.106" offset="2587773">The plaintiff's objected but the Court declined to act beyond ordering the defendants for the second time to submit a plan for the complete elimination of the biracial school system within a reasonable time.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.518" offset="2665409">The defendant's second desegregation plan was submitted in January 1966 and it too was sound as to faculty desegregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.313" offset="2720580">Both the plaintiffs and the Government objected.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.601" offset="2741791">And on March 22nd, the District Court, ordered the Board to adopt a desegregation plan providing in part and this appears on page 337 of the printed record that race or color will henceforth not be a factor in the hiring, assignment, reassignment, promotion, demotion or dismissal of teachers and other professional staff with the exception that assignments shall be made in order to eliminate the effects of past discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.545" offset="2893511">Teachers, principals and staff members will be assigned to schools so that the faculty and staff is not composed of members of one race and that is a fine statement but a completely general in its terms and Judge Johnson at that time stated from the bench that I will not expect too much of it, meaning faculty desegregation in September 1966 because of the timing but I will expect a considerable amount of it, effective in September 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.540" offset="3053484">However in August of 1966, following the decision of the Court of Appeals in a case involving the Mobile schools, Judge Johnson sua sponte declared that the Montgomery Board would have the same period available as the Court of Appeals had established for Mobile and that they would be allowed until the school year 1967-68 to commence desegregation of the faculty and professional staff in the Montgomery County school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.484" offset="3225266">At that time, the defendants had tentatively assigned four teachers of each race to teach in high schools attended predominantly by students of the opposite race for the 1966-67 year.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.460" offset="3297259">But after Judge Johnson's modification in August 1966, these assignments were not implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.729" offset="3346265">On June 1, 1967, the District Court ordered the defendants to adopt a desegregation plan with faculty provisions substantially similar to that which it had ordered in March 1966 but with certain additions.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.892" offset="3426931">The Court indicated for the first time that its desegregation order was to extend to student teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.143" offset="3459950">Also the Court directed and this appears at page 454 of the printed record, wherever possible, teachers will be assigned so that more than one teacher of the minority race, white or Negro will be on a desegregated faculty.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.863" offset="3538840">The school board will take positive and affirmative steps to accomplish the desegregation of its school faculties including substantial desegregation of faculties in as many of the schools as possible for the 1967-68 school year notwithstanding the teacher contracts for the 1967-68 or 1968-69 school year have already been signed and approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.690" offset="3650121">The objective of the school system is that the pattern of teacher assignment to any particular school shall not be identifiable as tailored for a heavy concentration of either Negro or white pupils in the school and here again is an excellent general statement with no appreciable specific standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.998" offset="3751372">As a result of which, the defendants assigned five teachers of each race to schools predominantly of the opposite race.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.224" offset="3796302">The 10 teachers taught only at four high schools in the City of Montgomery, none in any elementary schools, none in any of the schools outside of the city except that in the elementary schools, the defendants did assigned three white speech therapists to teach in all elementary schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.912" offset="3902986">On August 17, 1967, the Government objected to the defendant's failure to bring about more faculty desegregation and move for further relief and the plaintiffs in the action joined in the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.442" offset="3973099">There was a hearing in September 1967 and the superintendent of the Montgomery School Board, Mr. McKee explained the defendant's failure to assign desegregating faculty members to 48 of their 52 schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.679" offset="4058049">He said, we felt, there would be less objection in the senior high schools because one teacher would not have the pupils as much of today as they would in the lower grades.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.179" offset="4112071">He acknowledged reassigning over 40 Negro teachers from schools close pursuant to court order to other Negro schools for the 1967-68 school year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.950" offset="4167137">He also acknowledged assigning over 90 new teachers for the 1967-68 school year to schools where their race predominated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.237" offset="4220322">The Court declined to enter in a further order in the fall of 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.868" offset="4246862">However, in January 1968, the District Court set the August 1967 motion of the United States down for a second hearing in February 1968, a little over year ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.328" offset="4320632">Both the Government and the plaintiffs filed a supplemental motion for further relief shortly before the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.803" offset="4358562">In the meantime, the defendants had assigned six or seven additional white teachers to three or four more traditionally Negro schools, so that seven or eight of the 52 schools had desegregated facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.305" offset="4456573">The chief evidence concerning desegregation is summarized in the District Court's opinion of February 24, 1968.This is on page 493 and 494 of the printed record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.253" offset="4544345">Since the order of this Court on June 1, 1967, Judge Johnson said, “Defendants have assigned or transferred approximately 75 new teachers to faculties where their race was in the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.763" offset="4606412">Since the opening of school in September 1967, defendants have hired approximately 32 new teachers, 26 white and 6 Negro.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.057" offset="4659597">Of the 26 new white teachers, only six or seven have been placed in predominantly Negro schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.607" offset="4697840">All six negroes were assigned to predominantly Negro schools.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.869" offset="4726888">And the judge went on to say, “The defendants have adopted no adequate program for the assignment of student teachers on a desegregated basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.692" offset="4770147">None of the approximately 150 student teachers whose in the Montgomery County school system in the fall of 1967 were assigned to schools predominantly of the opposite race.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.654" offset="4821974">Four Negro schools -- four Negro student teachers have very recently been assigned to predominantly white schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.004" offset="4855411">There has been no faculty desegregation in the night schools operated by the Montgomery County school system.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.633" offset="4893863">Now, Judge Johnson could have added that the defendants had continue their policy of assigning Negro teachers only to negro schools and the two traditionally white senior high schools in the City of Montgomery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.137" offset="4963871">They had assigned no Negro teachers to traditionally white elementary or junior high schools or to a predominantly white senior high school outside of Montgomery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.110" offset="5027819">No teacher was assigned to teach an academic subject in a traditionally white school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.120" offset="5075884">Superintendent McKee testified that the defendants assigned white teachers to Negro schools only if the teachers expressed the willingness to teach there even though the superintendent knew he testified that the law did not permit him to rely on voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.677" offset="5162088">The defendants continued to hire new white teachers whose application showed that they would not accept integrated faculty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.995" offset="5199391">The defendants assigned Negro teachers to Negro schools even though they were willing to teach at traditionally white schools because of the defendant's concern for the reaction of white community members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.732" offset="5266265">And so in summary, at the time the order with which we are concerned was entered, prior to 1967, there was no faculty desegregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.997" offset="5319346">During 1967-68, 32 teachers, 26 white and 6 Negro out of over 1350 were assigned to schools where their race was in the minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.934" offset="5387160">Four of over 300 student teachers were assigned to desegregating positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.615" offset="5421850">No Negro substituted for a teacher in a traditionally white school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.870" offset="5442853">Night school facilities were segregated; during the year 1968-69, since the order of the court below, 216 teachers have been assigned to desegregating positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.894" offset="5518921">Now, in this situation, what was the order of Judge Johnson?</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.019" offset="5543476">It appears on pages 503 to 510 of the record but it was then amended on pages 520 to 523 and I think the most convenient place to examine it is as it is set out in the opinion of the Court of Appeals where it is set out with the amendments incorporated and that appears on page 754 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.024" offset="5663431">It is there exactly the same as in the references I previously gave except the amendments have been read in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.388" offset="5708884">It starts out on page 754, statement of objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.522" offset="5729468">In achieving the objective of the school system that the pattern of teacher assignments to any particular school shall not be identifiable as tailored for a heavy concentration of either Negro or white pupils in the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.756" offset="5790386">The school board will be guided by the ratio of Negro to white faculty members in the school system as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.748" offset="5826330">And that is about 60-40, about three to two, three white to two Negro.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.851" offset="5854751">The school board will accomplish faculty desegregation by hiring and assigning faculty members so that in each school, the ratio of white to Negro faculty members is substantially the same as it is throughout the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.855" offset="5918804">At present, the ratio is approximately three to two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.832" offset="5938657">This will be accomplished in accordance with the schedule set out below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.097" offset="5967809">And then under (b), schedule of faculty desegregation, 1968-69, that's the current school year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.563" offset="6009605">At every school with fewer than 12 teachers, the Board will have at least one full time teacher whose race is different from the race of the majority of the faculty and staff members of the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.110" offset="6071777">At every school with 12 or more teachers, the race of at least one of every six faculty and staff members will be different from the race of the majority of the faculty and staff members at the school and then the Court will reserve for the time being other specific faculty and staff desegregation requirements for future years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.340" offset="6184730">So that though there is a statement of objective in terms of three to two, the only order of the Court was that in schools of 12 or more faculty members, the ratio should be five to one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.995" offset="6271352">Now, that it seems to me is not as mechanical or rigid as it might seem when one examines the opinion of the Court of Appeals, I call attention to the top of the Court's opinion, the top of page 759 where the Court has in large capital letters, “fixed mathematical” ratio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.026" offset="6391515">The Court of Appeals because of that fixed mathematical ratio made two changes in the decree of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.697" offset="6446164">Instead of maintaining the five to one ratio, with respect to schools of 12 or more, it required inserting substantially and more approximately five to one, and then on page 765 of its opinion, it struck out the three to two ratio entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.441" offset="6577089">On page 765, the Court said, “There must be a good faith and effective beginning and good faith and effective effort to achieve faculty and staff desegregation for the entire system, although a ratio of substantially or approximately five to one is a good beginning, we cannot say that a ratio of substantially three to two simply because it mirrors the ratio balance of the entire faculty must be achieved as a final objective.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.662" offset="6713971">And so the ratio provisions of the District Court's opinion were left out and the only thing that was left in to guide the future development here is that there must be a good faith and effective beginning and a good faith and effective effort to achieve faculty and staff desegregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.532" offset="6805504">Now, that obviously is wholly vague and uncertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.424" offset="6821073">It means that the case must be tried a new every time it comes up at large and not merely on matters of detail in connection with the practical problems of complying with the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.821" offset="6882617">Indeed, it may well be that this is --</text>

            <text syncTime="1726.018" offset="7007483">Yes Mr. Justice, that would be considerably more than they had achieved so far and from the materials referred to in the respondent's brief here, it would appear that they have made substantial progress towards that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.591" offset="7069759">Five to one of course is a long way from three to two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.792" offset="7090552">It may be that the generality of the Court of Appeals opinion is no kindness to the school board of Montgomery County and its responsible employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.690" offset="7138095">The panel of the Court of Appeals said early in its opinion at the outset we note that the testimony of the school officials indicates a need for specific directives in the instant case and the Court set out some of that testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.543" offset="7221582">Before going further I should point out that the decision of the Court of Appeals was a two to one decision with Judge Thornberry dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.400" offset="7264946">The plaintiffs and the Government filed a petition for rehearing en banc before the full Court of Appeals, that petition was denied by a vote of six to six and within opinion supporting the rehearing by Chief Judge Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.893" offset="7350941">It should also be noted that the modification of the decree ordered by the Court of Appeals knocks out the portions of the District Court's order which were applicable to substitute teachers, student teachers and night schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.970" offset="7423248">It should be noted that at the time Judge Johnson's order was entered in February and March 1968, there had been virtually no desegregation of substitute teachers and none of student teachers are night schools and there were no plans in these areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.951" offset="7499212">Thus, it cannot be said that the respondents were making progress on these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.960" offset="7519169">They had not even started.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.210" offset="7544247">The brief for the respondents relies on the facts also relied on by the majority in the panel below that Judge Johnson several times complemented the respondents on their efforts and their progress over the years from 1964 to 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.095" offset="7643721">But this case can hardly be decided by recalling complements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.321" offset="7668694">The record also shows that Judge Johnson in February 1968 expressed his concern about the conduct of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.389" offset="7712893">He suggested that a geographic zone plan might be have to be imposed if it continued that conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.230" offset="7748315">In his February opinion, Judge Johnson spoke of aggravating conduct by the Board and he said that the respondents here would have to act less dilatorily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.443" offset="7805158">The respondents also rely on their brief on the appreciable progress which they have made over the past year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.667" offset="7842043">Since the decree of the District Court was entered and indeed since the decision of the panel of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.913" offset="7883003">We can be grateful for what they have accomplished but it is in fact far short of the objectives of the District Court's decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.923" offset="7927097">It may be that it complies with the requirements of the decree as modified by the panel of the Court of Appeals and this serves to illustrate the short comings of that modification since the results achieved are so far short of disestablishing the segregation in the respondent's school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.146" offset="8032005">We do not contend that the Constitution requires a mathematical ratio in the allocation of faculty members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.638" offset="8069935">We do not contend that such a ratio should be applied in all cases involving all school systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.748" offset="8102327">We have here a school system which was undeniably completely segregated by law for many years and in which no steps or plans were made for change up to 1964 when this suit was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.794" offset="8170559">We have here a case where token changes had been made over the four years from 1964 to 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.305" offset="8212564">We have here a case which has been presided over by an able and understanding district judge wholly familiar with the local situation who engaged in patient proving for a long time and then finally came to the conclusion that the ultimate result, this establishment of segregation in a system which had long been legally completely segregated would be achieved only by reallocation of teachers, so that no school would any longer carry that mark that it was a white school or a black school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.482" offset="8377344">The district judge in such a case should have wide latitude in formulating and structuring his decree in order to bring about a result which is undeniably in accordance with law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.166" offset="8444008">This is not a case where a judge has made a decree which condones their failure to comply with the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.620" offset="8481834">It is a case where a district judge in a case nearly four years old when he acted set down a standard for action which would clearly comply with the law as enunciated by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.674" offset="8550066">In such a situation, the decree of the district judge should not have been modified by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.181" offset="8588100">We submit that the judgment below should be reversed and the decree of the District Court should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2140.226" offset="8664273">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.609" offset="8677857">The Solicitor General has stated the facts in thorough detail and I will not rehearse them except to add one additional fact which appears in the record and that is that the exceedingly slow pace of progress and indeed such progresses has occurred in Montgomery County has occurred in a background of pervasive political opposition to desegregation throughout the state and that the specificity of the District Court's order should be read in the light of how useful an order like that may be with that kind of a background.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.920" offset="8859042">I might refer to page 392 of the record in which action of the state superintendent of education and of the governor in opposition to faculty desegregation as set forth and that is in the opinion of Lee against Macon County which is in the record here and which was affirmed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.945" offset="8943156">Sentence or two is Dr. Meadows, the State Superintendent, advised the local school official that he was calling as a constitutional officer of the State of Alabama and that the assignment of Negro teachers to white schools was against the law and public policy of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.906" offset="9007000">And I skipped awhile and about the same time, Attorney Hugh Maddocks, legal adviser to the governor telephoned the Tuscaloosa County superintendent and informed him that “It is the public policy of the state that negro teachers not teach white children and that the governor would use his police power to enforce the law.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="2251.015" offset="9107414">It was roughly contemporaneous with the opinion below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.008" offset="9123401">August 1966.</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="2256.331" offset="9128730">1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.960" offset="9131238">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.180" offset="9136044">While this case was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.921" offset="9143045">And so that the specificity of the order should be seen not only against the background of whatever it was that motivated the local school board but in a certain sense may be seen as a protective device for a local school board which desires to comply with an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.854" offset="9210755">Now, as the Solicitor General stated, this case involves two fundamental issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.557" offset="9245550">One is the question of the standards by which District Courts should review desegregation plans of school systems which have previously been segregated pursuant to law, and as another aspect of that, more importantly, it involves the vitality of this Court's decision last year in Green against County School Board where this Court held that desegregation plans must work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.599" offset="9357772">Two things should be stated clearly at the outset though they appear in the record and on the briefs and that is this case does not involve a hiring quota.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.339" offset="9396746">It is not a case in which any fixed proportion of Negro or white teachers must be employed by the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.121" offset="9423809">Or the standard of employment may be any objective standard as the standard employment has set forth in the decree of the United States against Jefferson County which was entered in this case previously and which appears in the record in the briefs and that is that race -- only that race may not be a standard in employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.458" offset="9517223">The Jefferson standard included also that race may be taken into account for the purpose of counter-acting or correcting the effect of the past segregated assignment of teachers in the dual system and to that extent, I think anticipated the ruling in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.466" offset="9589217">Second thing I think of considerable importance that should be noted is that the area of disagreement between the Court of Appeals and the District Court is not one of principle and not one of constitutionality but one of standards and workability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.588" offset="9657762">Judges Guinn and Elliott in the Court of Appeals on page 766 assert that race may be taken into account for purposes of counter acting or correcting the effects of racial segregation in any dual school system as has been held previously in this Court and elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.832" offset="9746683">Their objections of the ruling of the trial court is one of that it is not workable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.678" offset="9778134">It is not a sufficiently flexible system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.596" offset="9785762">On 763, they write, “it is our conclusion of the standards fixed by courts with respect to faculty desegregation cannot be totally inflexible and as a consequence, what they did was they took out the numerical ratios of substituting and then their court order merely doesn't tell the trial court of the school board what to do which it tells them not what to do which it tells them what not to do in 766.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.364" offset="9892864">Under the facts and circumstances of this case, the order will be modified accordingly and the numerical ratios set forth in the District Court order and decree will be eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.550" offset="9933615">Now, this Court in Green said that a plan must work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.930" offset="9951065">The district judge writing his opinion shortly before the decision in the Green case anticipated in effect what this Court said in Green and he set down a workable standard, a standard by which the District Court could work after he has to be able to measure whether or not there is compliance and by which the school board can work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.792" offset="10050539">As a substitute for that, the Court of Appeals gives us nothing and we would like to submit several reasons why we believe the District Court was clearly correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.202" offset="10084185">First of all, as the Solicitor General pointed out, the district judge has lived with this case for four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.069" offset="10111666">He knows the record, he knows the school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.583" offset="10121697">He knows the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.318" offset="10128593">He knows their internal problems and their problems they have with regard to the rest of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.546" offset="10149595">He found explicitly in his opinion that there were no administrative difficulties either to his immediate goals or to achieving his ultimate objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.068" offset="10183659">Secondly, the respondents in an appendix to their brief set forth what they have done with respect to the interim goals, that is the one to five.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.121" offset="10227858">And if you look at those statistics, they demonstrate that when the school board is given a numerical goal, it knows how to abide by it, and then a numerical goal can work and consequently, there is no reason to believe that if having been given one to five, they can't do more but the numerical ratio as having been stricken from the District Court opinion by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.160" offset="10328064">No one knows what to do now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.835" offset="10334751">Should they go to two to five, two-and-a-half to five, three to five, it's not known.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.250" offset="10356381">Thirdly, the superintendent in charge of faculties testified that he needed precise instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.131" offset="10383862">Generalities were not good enough for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.985" offset="10391280">On page 657, we have him testifying, 657 and 658, “I don't know what the objectives of the court order are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.342" offset="10428792">This is previous to the numerical ratios having been set down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.673" offset="10442062">That has never been laid down in any percentage fashion that I know of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.795" offset="10458572">It says that you will have reasonable desegregation of faculty and that you will strive to would have in each faculty not recognizable as being staff for particular race.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.682" offset="10494098">Now, with the order in that form, he didn't know what to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.332" offset="10508727">Judge Johnson has told him what to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.521" offset="10517504">The Court of Appeals has struck that out and now he is back where he started again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.794" offset="10538506">The situation is as he went on saying, that would depend upon with the definition of it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.320" offset="10560658">And we have discussed it many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.777" offset="10566510">I do not have a definition of what that would mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.874" offset="10578840">And this testimony of the school superintendent precisely describes what the state of mind of the school board has to be in the present status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.189" offset="10620113">The Court of Appeals has put him back in a situation in which according to his own testimony, he does not know what to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.199" offset="10648116">Now, the numerical ratio of 60-40 or three to two is not taken out of the blue on 668 of the record, we have Judge Johnson speaking to the superintendent and suggesting that perhaps a numerical ratio like that would be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.078" offset="10707675">And he says, “Your student population,” he was referring to the student population but he really must have meant in fact that the student ratio was somewhat different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.800" offset="10750621">“Your student population is 60-40.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.692" offset="10758144">“Yes sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.665" offset="10762010">“Ultimately, that would be optimum if you're going to eliminate the racial characteristics of your school through faculty, knotted to indicate affirmative reply.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.735" offset="10798268">And so when this was suggested to the school superintendent and the assistant superintendent towards the faculty as an acceptable ratio, he acquiesced in it to preferably an agreeable way of going about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.317" offset="10860648">Finally, the notion of numerical ratios is one which is entirely suitable for use by this board and indeed based to those initially that numbers was what they were going.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.483" offset="10909341">On 656 of the record, the assistant superintendent says, “Well, the way I'll go about it is first I'll put one in each school and then I'll put two in each school and then I'll put three in each school and so on and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.761" offset="10950405">So numbers is not an unconginular impossible way of working according to their own testimony and the judge pointed out indeed in his opinion that the formula which he proposed was a little different from what they were doing as founded in the record on page 526.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.318" offset="11024593">Now, the numerical ratio as I pointed out protects the Board in two senses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.074" offset="11039640">It protects them because now they know what to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.121" offset="11047894">It is less likely they will be contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.895" offset="11055000">It is less likely they will be in violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.527" offset="11061478">It protects them also against depredations by state authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.755" offset="11082376">And finally, other courts have found this type of approach useful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.761" offset="11110379">In the Dowell case in Oklahoma City, the Tenth Circuit affirmed the use of precisely such ratio and it might be pointed out that it initially was suggested by a panel of educators that it is being used in other courts throughout the country as cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.906" offset="11179029">Most importantly however, the Court of Appeals are no record whatsoever substituted a vapid good faith standard requirement for one which is resting on a solid record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.238" offset="11220302">This is based upon that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.274" offset="11228453">We submit to this Court that the history of desegregation in the courts has been that specificity and immediacy bring results and the generalities do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.118" offset="11275891">And this is the sense of the Green decision of this Court of last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.590" offset="11289684">Since Green has been handed down, it has indeed been working.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.469" offset="11309223">More important its effect is pervasive beyond the judicial system because its standards are being incorporated as the standards of this Court on other school desegregation issues are incorporated into the guidelines of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, so it has an effect beyond the ordinary effect of stare decisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.619" offset="11393860">We submit that the Court of Appeals decision is a throw back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.070" offset="11407653">There's no justification for it and that it should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="5025.800" offset="20206529">We will solve it in student desegregation and we'll solve it in fact that desegregation without the imposition of these compulsory mathematical ratios.</text>
            <text syncTime="5037.299" offset="20252609">The Government in brief and in argument have said that this is only -- that the mathematical ratio requirement is remedial and not for perpetuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5048.981" offset="20299316">I suppose that they are seeking to make the distinction between a de facto and a de jure public school system but when it comes to teachers, I failed to see the distinction between de facto and de jure or certainly it makes no difference as far as the neighborhood or fortuitous housing patterns as to what teachers are assigned to what schools and I think that even more in a de facto situation, what we call, what's been called de facto faculty integration is more important.</text>
            <text syncTime="5087.924" offset="20455111">We can't see either teachers there, they are not, if they are not, they have the school as identifiable as patterned for one particular race or another, we think that the problem exists whether you call it de facto or whether you call it de jure, the teachers are either there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5102.385" offset="20512893">It's either identifiable as white or identifiable as black.</text>
            <text syncTime="5108.536" offset="20537553">If they say it's not for perpetuity if a charge of racial imbalance is made, continued to be made, if the charges of racial identifiability is made, the perpetuity of the racial ratio requirement would exist just as long as these charges are made.</text>
            <text syncTime="5127.623" offset="20613831">And we say that we are going about in Montgomery, Alabama to provide non-racially identified faculties in each schools and we say that it's unwise, educationally unsound and not consistent with quality education to have a mathematical ratio and I've tried to explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="5148.175" offset="20696064">But if we're doing it and if we're getting the job done as the District Court noted in the opinion that's been quoted from, Judge Johnson said that you are doing as much without the racial requirement or as what you tell us you do is the Court requiring you to do anyway at record page 562.</text>
            <text syncTime="5172.033" offset="20791463">What's exactly required in the court order is very little that it's any more than the school board by his testimony and by the school that we're going to do anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="5178.549" offset="20817586">But we planned to assign faculty and staff, so the schools are not identifiable racially and also to carefully consider the quality placement.</text>

            <text syncTime="5198.796" offset="20898565">The individuality in imparting knowledge from one to another is an intensely personal endeavor and it's just not can't possibly be in the best interest of public education for blacks or whites, to assign these people according to color, to assign professional teachers according to their bodies and not as to individuality.</text>
            <text syncTime="5221.795" offset="20990516">Now, we recognize that we must foremost in our minds keep the consideration of desegregating the faculties and we state to the Court that we are but we ask for the opportunity to desegregate our faculties and do it consistently with quality education.</text>
            <text syncTime="5239.722" offset="21062301">And as the Solicitor General commented candidly so I thought, the Montgomery County Board has made significant progress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5248.731" offset="21098245">We got significant progress we say in faculty desegregation and in students and we state to the Courts that we're going to continue but we ask for the opportunity to continue with our constitutional requirements to desegregate and at the same time, let us consider this vital, the critical element of the individuality in faculty assignment.</text>
