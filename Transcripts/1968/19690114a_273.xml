            <text syncTime="126.108" offset="607796">The employee was free to work, free to make more than the ceiling permitted and the employer had to pay him under the collective agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.929" offset="655130">There was collective bargaining over the ceilings as to the general level of the ceilings, but never were the ceilings accepted in bargaining as a limit on the individual and as the individual who is complaining here.</text>

            <text syncTime="154.451" offset="721168">Mr. Justice Brennan's question exposes what for me has been a difficulty in reading the briefs and to answer this argument and that is the apparent disagreement among the parties as to what the facts are.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.613" offset="797863">You state as number one on the questions presented, referring to the ceilings, you talk about production quotas established and enforced by the union and the government trying to persuade us that really these things, while not explicitly written out of the collective bargaining agreement, are nonetheless where by custom, practice and basic recognition were part and parcel of the agreement between the union and the employer and that makes for two quite different cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.718" offset="962226">I'm interested in knowing which case do we have before us?</text>

            <label>Mr. James Urdan</label>
            <text syncTime="218.022" offset="975496">I think there's some truth in both positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.049" offset="991587">From the standpoint of the employees who are complaining here, the case we have is that a collective bargaining agreement was entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.877" offset="1034846">This union bargained it and agreed with the employer and the collective bargaining agreement set no limit on the production or on the earnings of these men.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.215" offset="1080195">They could produce to their capacity, they could claim pay for that work and they would have to be paid for that work.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.771" offset="1114467">That is the bargain that the union made with the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.095" offset="1131708">Now it is true that the employer and the union bargained from time-to-time about the level of ceilings, because the employer recognized this is as a fact of life in the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.692" offset="1182177">He recognized that the union had these ceilings.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.277" offset="1196492">The employer recognized that it was in his interest to have the ceilings increased from time-to-time and he bargained for that objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.355" offset="1236825">He tried to get the ceilings removed, not totally successfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.366" offset="1260857">The union tried to get the employer to agree to the ceilings and they failed in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.841" offset="1286771">The employer never agreed to put a ceiling on the earnings of these men.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.121" offset="1307878">We have in essence a standoff in the bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.591" offset="1325746">Neither side got what it wanted, but as far as these employees are concerned, they worked under a collective bargaining agreement that permitted them to exceed the ceiling, to earn more and to collect their pay and the employer had to pay them, employer could not refuse to pay them.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.865" offset="1406830">This is their complaint that the union fine is bypassing the collective agreement and the collective bargaining process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1489.906" offset="6063000">The whole concept of the Act is that the party should sit down, reason together, attempt to resolve their differences.</text>

            <text syncTime="1644.674" offset="6682102">In this connection, I think we should look at the proviso to Section 8(b)(1)(A), so I think the proviso has been badly misconstrued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.460" offset="6741243">I think the purpose of the proviso has been misunderstood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.170" offset="6764022">The proviso says that the union may establish rules with respect to acquisition and retention of membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.155" offset="6804041">This has been looked at in the context of these fine cases as a guarantee that the union can control its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.336" offset="6848763">This was not the purpose of the proviso and nothing to do with control of members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.245" offset="6876348">The purpose of the proviso was to permit unions to decide who their members shall be, not to tell the member what to do, but to decide who the member shall be was a concept of freedom of association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.671" offset="6946043">The union can decide who will participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.193" offset="6964120">There is traces from the debate that went on in Congress preceding the introduction of Section 8(b)(1)(A).</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.271" offset="6996407">It was a great issue in the congressional debates as to the closed shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.854" offset="7038830">There is a lot of public concern about this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.808" offset="7058578">The idea that the man had to belong to the union in order to hold a job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.873" offset="7090866">The choice that was presented to the Congress either open up the union or open up the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.818" offset="7118660">There were strong advocates of the position that the union should be open that every man should have right to join the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.067" offset="7151679">Now this issue was debated and the unions didn't like that idea and a number of senators, particularly from the South did not like the idea that the union should be open because they had segregated unions, and these very issues were debated explicitly and so the decision was reached, you don't have to have an open union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.419" offset="7245093">You don't have to let people in if you don't want to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.743" offset="7258363">Instead we'll have the open shot or the open job or you don't have to be a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.597" offset="7285739">Now this was the background when Section 8(b)(1)(A) was introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.964" offset="7315205">Section 8(b)(1)(A) says you cannot coerce a member, you cannot coerce an employee in the exercise of his rights under Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.030" offset="7359509">One of those rights being the right to participate in union activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.824" offset="7378631">Now the opponents of the open union became very concerned again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.924" offset="7399111">They said is this going to open up the union?</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.072" offset="7411649">Is it going to be considered restraint or coercion when we segregate or keep people out of the union and that is why the proviso was introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.969" offset="7467238">It was to confirm this concept that the union didn't have to be open.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.804" offset="7490539">The proviso was introduced simply to confirm the commitments that had been made in this debate on the closed shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.261" offset="7524394">It is not in any sense a grant of authority to control the actions of the members, rather it is to guarantee to the union that it can control its own membership and who will participate within the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.386" offset="7596910">Now, the proviso to 8(b)(1)(A) is not a grant of authority to discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.290" offset="7636511">Now, we have also in this case a jurisdictional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.412" offset="7653021">I'd like to devote a few minutes to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.266" offset="7676426">The petition for certiorari was filed within 90 days of the decree of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.900" offset="7711013">The question has been raised whether the 90-day period should run from the date of the opinion of the Court of Appeals and an order that was entered that same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.329" offset="7772662">I think reviewing the record it will be perfectly clear that the intention of the Court of Appeals was that the decree of April 16th was the decree in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.676" offset="7838072">The statute starts the 90-day period running from the date of entry of the judgment or decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.635" offset="7873912">It doesn't say the date of the opinion, it doesn't say the date of the decision, it doesn't say the date of the resolution of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2588.883" offset="10458885">It reflects a determination on the basis of time studies of the number of pieces of work that an average operator would turn out in an hour after an adjustment for such factors as picking up and cleaning tools, fatigue and personal needs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2852.013" offset="11511411">Although there was a union security arrangement in this case like the union security arrangement in Allis-Chalmers, it gave the employees the option of either becoming full-fledged union members or paying only a service fee, and all of the four plaintiffs here insofar as the record shows opted to become full-fledged union members and have been so for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.730" offset="11634291">Now since at least 1944, the union here has by membership rule placed a ceiling on the amount above the minimum or the machine rate which an employee member may claim as current earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.921" offset="11735019">Now the, if the present, the time of this hearing, the ceilings were about $0.40 to $0.50 an hour above the machine rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.208" offset="11768247">They're shown at page 50 of the record, the comparison between the machine rate and the ceiling rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.797" offset="11798549">Now, it's important to emphasize that the rule as it has been consistently interpreted and applied does not preclude the employee from producing in excess of the ceiling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.686" offset="11854137">And if he does, the extra production physically enters the flow of company operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.114" offset="11887783">The rule merely requires an employee to forgo demanding immediate compensation under the banking procedure that Mr. Justice Brennan referred to for a later time, when the receipt of the earnings would be less likely to disrupt employee morale and working conditions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3009.608" offset="12141798">Under these ceiling banking system, the employee can draw on the earnings that he has accumulated in there and be paid at the ceiling rate and the company has co-operated by paying him at such a rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.787" offset="12226539">Moreover it has furnished the production cards to the union so that the union can periodically check compliance with the ceiling and further more it pays the union stewards for the time that they spend in checking the cards.</text>

            <text syncTime="3083.403" offset="12436982">If we go back to 1944 or even to 1938 actually when it first started as a result of a gentleman's agreement among the union members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.340" offset="12484733">However, since then it has been regularly the subject of collective bargaining between the employer and the union when the contracts have come up for negotiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.074" offset="12559653">Indeed petitioners concede at page 3 of their brief that the ceilings have been the subject of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.799" offset="12594552">Now I'll refer you to the findings of the trial examiner on page 68 of the record, which sets forth the way the typical negotiation works, the reading as I pass through here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.109" offset="12679816">Among the subjects embraced by the contract negotiations, is the setting of the ceiling rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.425" offset="12717119">And skipping down a bit further and so into typical negotiations, the employer begins by asking the union to agree to eliminate the ceiling and as the second alternative proposes a raise in the ceiling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.569" offset="12773648">As an inducement thereof, it may offer a concession in a form of a raise in the guaranteed ROE machine rate and the raise in turn conditions be extent to which the union will agree to raise the ceiling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.975" offset="12835297">And then the trial examiner concludes at the bottom of 69, the status thus achieved by the ceiling program is the product of hard bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.822" offset="12878660">And this is reflected even in some of the written agreements that the parties have concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.818" offset="12922650">For instance, the 1953 contract which is not reprinted here, but is in general counsel's exhibit 17, provided specifically that the previous agreement be modified to increase the ceilings, a total of 13 cents per hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.074" offset="12995688">In the 1956 strike settlement agreement, which is set forth in the record, at page 49 at the bottom it says the ceilings on earnings is to be raised ten cents per hour above the general increase of an earlier date.</text>

            <text syncTime="4070.111" offset="16383770">We say probably, given the case of Homebuilders in the Ninth Circuit which has been read by both sides here, given a case where the union attracts a certain requirement under the contract such as the 8 hour day in an ordinary hourly rate of plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="4410.057" offset="17743600">The union said the ceiling is good for the union and the company, if they remove it, they'd have confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4415.109" offset="17763767">The union said the ceilings are $0.40 to $0.50 per hour above the timing rate, that's the average rate, which is considered a fair day's work if maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="4424.219" offset="17800234">Todd, that's the company President, figures that his claims shows that the spread between the timing rate and the ceilings has gradually diminished.</text>
            <text syncTime="4432.134" offset="17831894">In other words, here are the parties bargaining precisely on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4435.353" offset="17844746">Is this ceiling set at a level where a fair day's work is no longer being maintained?</text>
            <text syncTime="4440.583" offset="17865749">The company saying, yes, this is what has happened, the union is saying it hasn't and they resolved it by increasing the ceilings $0.03 per hour, so that the very issue as to a fair day's work as against slowdown has been bargained by these parties and the result has been compromised.</text>
            <text syncTime="4454.805" offset="17922591">We say therefore, the very hard case that Justice Fortas puts of a union rule that requires a man to violate a contract is simply not before this Court, in a double sense that this particular arrangement and existence since 1944 has won acquiescence, acceptance and agreement from the employer as it applies to union members, and that in any event even if it had not won that acquiescence, the scheme as it operates is not a production limiting slowdown scheme, men are doing a fair day's work under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4486.113" offset="18047875">And to say that this is -- may I just conclude Your Honor, it's to say this is featherbedding because a man can't use the absolute maximum incentive to produce the absolute last piece, just to say that hourly wages as featherbedding, because it's perfectly clear under hourly wages that five out of six industrial employees in this country are now employed on hourly wages, not on incentive, under hourly wages there is no incentive for the man to work his head off, to work himself to death for earnings, now is that featherbedding?</text>
            <text syncTime="4513.665" offset="18158007">We don't think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4514.393" offset="18160933">Therefore, to say that a reasonable limit, ceiling on what incentive pay shall be earned is no more featherbedding or slowdown or make work an hourly rate slowdown.</text>

            <text syncTime="4943.943" offset="19879163">Well, I defend legally on this basis Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4946.393" offset="19888985">We think the National Labor Relation Act Section 8(b)(1) permits a union to have rules not plainly ultra vires, where there is legitimate union interest underlying them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4955.881" offset="19926915">To say there's no legitimate union interest in this situation in putting an upper limit on piece rates is really to say there's no legitimate union interest in the negotiation of hourly wages and yet five out six workers work on hourly wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="4968.688" offset="19978115">That is the unions have found incentive schemes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4971.380" offset="19988877">If they're not retarded or checked by any upper limits, to be corrosive of the internal relationships within the union, to lead to speedups, to layoffs and to demoralization. Now that's a legitimate union interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4983.204" offset="20036211">The Board, the examiner and the Court below all found it to be a legitimate union interest, which goes further I think that Allis-Chalmers required this Court to draw and looking at this union rule from the point of view of its ultra vires side of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4996.881" offset="20090859">We say a rule which is not plainly ultra vires in the sense that it infringes on some personal civil liberty or right, but within the areas a union's legitimate judgments about the interests of man.</text>
            <text syncTime="5007.102" offset="20131819">It's clearly protected under Section 8(b)(1)(a) from Labor Board intrusion, unless and I want to back to the unless, unless the rule has been used as a means of subverting some other right protected by the Act, such as Section (8)(b)(2), (8)(b)(3) and (8)(b)(4) and I want to point this Court that there's no proviso to Section (8)(b)(2) or (8)(b)(3) or (8)(b)(4) such a proviso to (8)(b)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="5030.534" offset="20225546">And that Marine Workers in our opinion is essentially demonstrative only of the fact that the limits of the exemption Congress afforded to unions to apply non ultra vires rules to their members by membership discipline are reached. When you come to an intrusion by such discipline upon some other person's protected right under the Act, the neutral under (8)(b)(4), the employer under (8)(b)(3), others under (8)(b)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="5054.892" offset="20322931">I see my time is about to expire and I want to make one point to this Court which has been lost track of and that's the point that we are not here before this Court saying either there is no -- we're not saying this Court, there's no relief for injustices and arbitrariness in this entire area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5072.294" offset="20392521">As I said to the Court in Allis-Chalmers, the Common Law Courts have traditionally been available.</text>
            <text syncTime="5077.089" offset="20411747">This Court in Gonzales said it's the Common Law Courts that you go, if union rules are arbitrarily applied and you get back in the union if you're wrongfully thrown out.</text>
            <text syncTime="5085.224" offset="20444244">The question is this not whether they shall be relieved somewhere because the case has been pending in eight years in Wisconsin and then we just lost it last year, it's in our brief, on the merits of collecting this fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="5095.925" offset="20487084">So there's plenty of remedy in the State Courts, the question is shall the Labor Board get into this thicket, into what Professor Cox called a dismal swamp of (8)(b)(1) litigation of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="5106.317" offset="20528671">We say that the most important reason not to tamper with the congressional decision, in 1947 and 1959 to leave this outside the province of the Labor Board is that the Labor Board has been entrusted with the function of being the principle arbiter between management and union.</text>
            <text syncTime="5124.262" offset="20600456">Now, if that principle arbitration function is to that function of being the mediator, the man in-between the two contending sides, of in addition by sort of rewriting of 1947 history, the Labor Board now becomes also the policemen of intra-union conduct, then its credibility, its acceptance to play on the union side of this nation's forces will be impaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="5148.732" offset="20698258">There's nobody less well situated to become the policemen of intra-union judgments and disputes of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="5155.892" offset="20726888">One man says I like this union rule, or one says I don't like it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5159.125" offset="20739845">No one it seems to us politically wisdom was reflected by Congress when it said it is precisely the Labor Board which is the mediator between the two contending sides which shall not go in there and become the policemen of union discipline and union rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="5174.102" offset="20799822">We think great political wisdom is reflected in that judgment and that seems to us the paramount reason why this Court should leave the matters and disputes of this kind in the Common Law Courts and precisely why the Labor Board is the last body that Congress would have wanted in, and to never put them into this business but it wanted in just -- deciding is a good rule or bad rule or reasonable rule or an unreasonable rule, socially desirable rule or not, do we agree with the majority of 98% of the men at this plant who have always voted for this rule or do we go with four men in this particular case who don't like the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="5209.835" offset="20942764">That's precisely what was not for the Labor Board and we believe that it best be left where this Court said in Gonzales it wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="5218.393" offset="20976933">It would left the Common Law Courts where man who was improperly disciplined can get relief and if the rule upon which he has been punished is an arbitrary rule, the common law courts will not enforce it as in Gonzales, they will put it back in the union, if it's expelled, they will give him back his damages, if he had any damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="5235.952" offset="21047150">The issue is keeping some clear lines of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5239.658" offset="21061987">The present lines we submit are right and we comeback there for to the following rule which we need in all respects, a rule not ultra vires, a union rule not plainly ultra vires, does not violate Section 8(b)(1) when it's enforced by reasonable discipline on the member unless the --</text>

            <text syncTime="5327.385" offset="21412864">I'd like to comment first on the last two points made by counsel for the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="5335.927" offset="21447032">The union position asserts Section 8(b)(1)(a) is violated when you also violate Section 8(b)(2), (3) or (4) or (5) or (6).</text>
            <text syncTime="5346.791" offset="21490500">We cannot accept this reading of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5349.004" offset="21499382">8(b)(1)(a) has a purpose of its own and it's been found to be violated without also involving other sections of Section 8(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="5362.342" offset="21552776">The suggestion that the employees have a remedy in the common law courts is perhaps generous, but not very helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="5370.717" offset="21586213">Wisconsin Courts have said that the union fine is collectable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5378.115" offset="21615783">They've said this on the basis of the Allis-Chalmers decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5382.498" offset="21633337">They have also said that even a contrary state policy can't be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="5388.399" offset="21656952">They say because of the Allis-Chalmers rational we can't even apply our own Wisconsin law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5394.705" offset="21682239">We have to permit collection of the fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="5397.735" offset="21694360">These employees are not going to get much relief from the Wisconsin Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5404.959" offset="21723199">Now the contention is made that this a reasonable rule and I think the record shows that it is not a reasonable rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="5415.165" offset="21764054">Employees do not put in a normal working day until the company attempted to impose some restrictions, there was card playing, reading of magazines, it didn't look like an industrial plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5432.723" offset="21834271">The President of the company testified at the hearing that he was ashamed, the President was ashamed to take visitors into the plant after lunch because the man aren't working.</text>
            <text syncTime="5446.044" offset="21887561">You get these unreasonable results when you permit unreasonable coercion, that's precisely why coercion is outlawed by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5457.653" offset="21933955">When you permit coercion, the union doesn't have to worry whether it's a reasonable rule or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5463.877" offset="21958928">They just go ahead and enforce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5469.179" offset="21980139">The Union says its legitimate interests are involved and certainly there is a legitimate interest in negotiating workloads and matters of this sort, but the question of the legitimate interest includes the method that is used to attain the objective just because it's a worthy objective would not permit an impermissible method and this method is coercive.</text>

            <text syncTime="5524.094" offset="22199777">We don't have to come here speaking for the employer, we speak for the man who are working under a contract that doesn't say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5532.227" offset="22232273">The contract says they'll be paid for the work they produce, the union is trying to prevent them from doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5542.135" offset="22271875">You are perfectly correct that the employer has his remedy in collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="5547.349" offset="22292773">These employees do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5553.695" offset="22318164">Now the union tells us that the rule here is not a production restriction as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="5564.247" offset="22360377">They cite various text writers who to tell the reasons why incentive pay is objectionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5573.225" offset="22396322">These texts are interesting, but that isn't what the union witnesses said at the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5581.279" offset="22428505">The union, one of the founders of the union and the man who was intimately involved in the creation of the ceiling testified at the hearing, this is at page 45 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="5597.045" offset="22491512">We wanted to see that this labor state keep as many fellows working as we possibly could and we know if we put this thing on there it would provide for at least a few more fellows to stay at work.</text>
            <text syncTime="5611.280" offset="22548459">And he says the fellows are for this ceiling because it provides jobs.</text>

            <text syncTime="5619.881" offset="22582941">He was asked what would happen if they took the ceiling off.</text>
            <text syncTime="5623.345" offset="22596733">He didn't say there would be jealousies, he didn't say the older workers would be prejudiced, he didn't recite any of these reasons [Inaudible] now advances.</text>
            <text syncTime="5634.018" offset="22639470">He says, if the ceiling were taken off, it would mean a loss of jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5640.644" offset="22665906">That is what the union was trying to accomplish, having more men at work than were required.</text>

            <text syncTime="5767.095" offset="23171741">The first the purpose of the union rule, what is it that the union is trying to accomplish?</text>
            <text syncTime="5773.500" offset="23197341">Secondly does the method used by the union confirm with the statutory policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5783.361" offset="23236838">In the Allis-Chalmers case, the strike was considered to be so important, the union had no other method other than violence for accomplishing its objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="5795.531" offset="23285530">Here the union has no such need.</text>
            <text syncTime="5799.120" offset="23299845">It can accomplish its objective by collective bargaining and that is precisely what the act envisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5805.939" offset="23327117">This is how the union should resolve questions of pay and production loads.</text>
            <text syncTime="5816.069" offset="23367659">Mr. Scofield is not a young man, he is not an eager beaver.</text>
            <text syncTime="5821.046" offset="23387512">I wish he were here in the court room, so that you might see him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5824.791" offset="23402559">This man in his 50s.</text>
            <text syncTime="5826.963" offset="23411231">He does not work harder than other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="5830.259" offset="23424397">He does not take other than normal breaks.</text>
            <text syncTime="5833.646" offset="23437981">The only thing he really does that's any different is to work the full working day.</text>
            <text syncTime="5839.726" offset="23462327">That's really all he does different.</text>
            <text syncTime="5842.283" offset="23472462">For the union to advance these various other justifications for the rule, is really beside the point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5851.631" offset="23509870">I think something should be said about the voluntary membership concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="5857.321" offset="23532648">This is an area where there is a great divergence between theory and practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5863.873" offset="23558875">Voluntary membership sounds fine in the law review article.</text>
            <text syncTime="5869.615" offset="23581863">In the industrial plant the membership is not quite so voluntary hence you might think tremendous pressures of every kind for people to join the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="5882.871" offset="23634840">And once they are in tremendous pressures to stay in, Mr. Scofield for example attempted to resign in 1959 over this very issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="5894.294" offset="23680502">He didn't like the production ceiling.</text>
            <text syncTime="5897.086" offset="23691682">He tried to resign.</text>
            <text syncTime="5898.095" offset="23695757">He turned in his union card.</text>
            <text syncTime="5900.396" offset="23704952">The union wouldn't take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5904.571" offset="23721671">He was summoned in and there was discussion with I believe 11 members of the union –</text>

            <label>Mr. James Urdan</label>
            <text syncTime="5913.025" offset="23755421">No it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5915.436" offset="23765138">I am merely trying to illustrate that the voluntary membership question is a matter of a practical problem it should not be approached in any theoretical way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5930.764" offset="23826474">I think that Congress recognize this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5934.165" offset="23840057">Legislative hearings brought out this type of problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="5938.827" offset="23858657">Many people are union members not because they like it but simply because of the pressures in their work situation and furthermore they are required to pay dues to this union whether they want to or not and they are represented by this union whether they want the union or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5958.950" offset="23939218">This the law provides, so the voluntariness I think is really not a true characterization of this relationship and that is precisely why Congress extended these benefits to union members, the same as non-members because Congress knew that the member needed this protection, that is precisely what the debate reveals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5989.978" offset="24063248">I'd like to say one word about the effect of this type of rule or sanction and the democratic process within the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="6002.544" offset="24113507">The union in formulating its bargaining position ordinarily would have to take cognizance of the views of all the members.</text>
            <text syncTime="6014.153" offset="24160005">If a -- even where a majority has one opinion in a legislative type of body, must also consider the minority opinion and the minority opinions have influence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6029.550" offset="24221550">Where you have voluntary unionism, where you have voluntary adherence to union rules then the union has some pressure to accommodate competing view points within the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="6046.334" offset="24288737">When you permit the union to impose fines, you lose that all important element of giving these men a voice in what goes on.</text>
            <text syncTime="6058.949" offset="24339205">What happens the union leadership can impose the fine, the suppress dissent, they suppress the right of the individual, they don't have to worry what he thinks anymore, consequently the opinion or the role of these men in establishing the union policy is simply suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6083.080" offset="24435649">A union member needs protection from his organization just the same as the man in the police station needs protection from the police or the other decisions of this Court which have highlighted the conflict, the difficult position the individual is in when he is faced by what is really an overwhelming organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="6110.514" offset="24545468">The employee needs protection from coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6113.991" offset="24559365">He needs protection from coercion from the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="6117.380" offset="24572844">He needs protection from coercion by his union.</text>
            <text syncTime="6121.197" offset="24588204">Here the union has coerced him by the fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="6125.814" offset="24606595">The fine is collectable in court under the law of the state where this occurred, the employee is going to be defenseless against this collection.</text>
            <text syncTime="6135.400" offset="24644942">His rights under the statute have been infringed and he should be granted relief.</text>
