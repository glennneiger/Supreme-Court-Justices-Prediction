            <label>Mr. E. Barrett Prettyman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="35.850" offset="246784">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.956" offset="271235">This case involves only a single question but one of great importance in the administration of the Federal Safety Appliance Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.036" offset="319509">The question is whether in a suit under that Act brought by a non-railroad employee, the railroad can assert the defense of contributory negligence, and everyone concedes that the petitioner in this case is covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.126" offset="395891">Everyone concedes that if this same suit were brought by a railroad employee, contributory negligence could not be asserted as a defense, even though all the facts were precisely the same and the violation of the Act was precisely the same as in the case of the non-railroad employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.972" offset="487215">Here, petitioner Ronald Crane was employed as a meal house helper by Cargill, Incorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.703" offset="522219">His job was to spot, weigh and help load railroad cars which were delivered empty by the respondent railroad to Cargill, and after loading were picked up again by the respondent railroad for delivering in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.299" offset="600586">The trial court properly instructed the jury and this Court can assume that for the purpose of this case, the railway cars on which plaintiff was working were being used by the defendant as part of its system?</text>
            <text syncTime="141.733" offset="670281">Now on the night of the accident, 1963, petitioner Crane and his co-worker Harris, were handling a string of six railroad cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.989" offset="715316">Harris detached or uncoupled the two most northerly cars in the string and moved them along the tracks for weighing by means of an electric winch and cable.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.938" offset="767143">When these cars were returned to the string, impact was made with the remaining four cars with sufficient force to move those cars some five feet, even though the brake was on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.789" offset="826493">Now at that point, the two cars clearly should've re-coupled automatically to the string of four cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.594" offset="857736">As this Court undoubtedly knows from prior cases, the Federal Safety Appliance Act as interpreted by this Court provides that railroad cars must be equipped with couplers which couple automatically by impact and when set in the proper position of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.442" offset="933177">And which will thereafter remain coupled until set free by some purposeful act of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.878" offset="962853">Now in this case, the knuckles were in proper position, and the cars collided with sufficient impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.437" offset="993155">Both Crane and Harris who looked at the mechanism thought and testified that the knuckles were closed and that the couplers appeared to be locked, but in fact they were not locked.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.397" offset="1052923">Hours later, Harris began to move the entire string of cars forward by attaching the winch to the second car with Crane on the third car ready to put the brakes on, and the first two cars began to move out on their own, runaway cars uncoupled to the rest of the string.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.707" offset="1146232">Crane thought that these runaway cars were going to ram into an empty car which he thought he'd seen down the tracks and which he thought men were working, and consequently he quickly put the brake on the third car, he jumped down, he ran along the tracks, he climbed up a ladder on the back of the second car, began to turn the brake to stop these two runaway cars and he fell to the tracks to a cement pavement.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.173" offset="1236093">The bones in his feet were jammed up into his legs and he was permanently injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.252" offset="1260335">Now before proceeding further, I want to say just a word about the statement of facts given by respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.099" offset="1283741">We've answered each of these statements with citations to the record in our reply brief, but the most direct answer to them is that precisely the same argument on the facts was made twice below to the trial court in an effort to keep this case from going to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.802" offset="1350614">Once at the conclusion of our evidence, once at the conclusion of all the evidence, twice the trial judge rejected that version of the facts, twice the trial said this case can go to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.613" offset="1393873">And consequently we submit that the respondent railroad is not free again here to reargue these facts which properly for the -- or for the jury and which went to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.318" offset="1440684">Crane brought his case in an Iowa State Court alleging violation of the Federal Safety Appliance Act and that the railroad had provided cars with defective couplers.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.621" offset="1493870">From the outset of this case, Crane argued that contributory negligence was not a defense, was not a defense where there was a violation of the Federal Safety Appliance Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.876" offset="1542875">That liability was absolute once a violation was shown to be approximate cause of his injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.683" offset="1574118">The railroad argued otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.612" offset="1581850">And the trial judge adopted the railroads argument and allowed the defense of contributory negligence to go to the jury and as a matter of fact put the burden on Crane to prove absence of contributory negligence rather than on the railroad to prove the presence of contributory negligence.</text>

            <label>Mr. E. Barrett Prettyman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="401.820" offset="1710686">Now the jury decided for the railroad and denied all recovery to Crane, the Iowa Supreme Court affirmed with two justices dissenting, although it recognized that recent opinions of this Court put the matter in some doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.985" offset="1771290">It did not feel free to depart from what it considered older case law indicating that all common law defenses except assumption of risk are applicable to non-railroad employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.710" offset="1822177">That now is the issue before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.131" offset="1839940">Now the problem arises because the Federal Safety Appliance Act was passed in 1893 without any specific reference to a remedy other than a suit for penalties by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.835" offset="1894693">And consequently, suits for violation of this Act were brought in state courts, and the earliest case on contributory negligence from this Court, the Schlemmer case, held that in the absence of legislation at the time of the injury in that case taking away the defense, the common law controlled.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.276" offset="1980479">We show in our brief how we think Schlemmer was misinterpreted in later decisions, but in any event it certainly true that between 1911 and 1935, this Court did state in dicta in several opinions that state law controlled as to the defense of contributory negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.569" offset="2057697">That certainly is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.145" offset="2067937">In the meantime however --</text>

            <text syncTime="529.434" offset="2221119">But you'll recall that in FELA, as soon as there is a violation of the Federal Safety Act, Congress made it very clear that contributory negligence went out the window altogether.</text>

            <label>Mr. E. Barrett Prettyman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="542.425" offset="2273050">Now FELA of course was passed in 1908, and by itself it covered only railroad employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.743" offset="2310353">This Act did set out a specific cause of action, a federal cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.571" offset="2333654">It provided that in a suit under FELA alone, as we've pointed out, the contributory negligence of the employee would diminish damages if it was only under FELA and would do away with contributory negligence if a violation of the Federal Safety Act would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.029" offset="2403453">And in those early cases under both FELA and the Safety Act, liability in those days was thought off in traditional negligence terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.482" offset="2449324">The charges to the juries in those days and even in the language in this Court's opinions in those early days talked in terms of negligence, in terms of due care, and so I think it's hardly surprising that this Court in these early cases accept that the general doctrine that a contributory negligence would be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.169" offset="2528005">But beginning in the late 1930's a change began to take place in the reading of the Safety Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.830" offset="2566666">Commentators have pointed out that the change was comparable to the development or the evolution of the law in regard to interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.831" offset="2598745">The court in the late 1930's, sensing that the restrictions which the state courts were placing on recovery in these cases was not the will of Congress, began requiring stricter standards of liability by the railroads for violating the Safety Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.431" offset="2673142">The court finally said that liability under the Act had nothing whatever to do with negligence, negligence was completely out of the matter, and that the railroad owed an absolute duty to those properly upon its lines to maintain its equipment in efficient condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.929" offset="2743045">And then in due course, the court came to the terms absolute liability, and absolute prohibition in interpreting the Safety Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.028" offset="2791528">Now the use of these terms could hardly have been inadvertent or imprecise as suggested by the Iowa Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.189" offset="2824129">The Shields case for example, involved the employee of an independent contractor and therefore it had nothing to do with FELA, it was not brought under FELA at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.695" offset="2862164">Contributory negligence was specifically pleaded as a defense in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.062" offset="2883584">The trial court instructed the contributory negligence was not a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.033" offset="2907512">The railroad made this a point on appeal to the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.303" offset="2924544">The Fifth Circuit specifically said that the plaintiff was invoking absolute liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.344" offset="2948786">This Court in its opinion mentioned that plaintiff was invoking absolute liability, and then it went on to say that violation of the Act did result in absolute liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.181" offset="3000090">Now in the light of the record in the case like that to say that this Court had merely used the term absolute viability loosely or inadvertently of course we say simply makes no sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.156" offset="3055992">What we're asking here is that this Safety Act be interpreted in the light of the overall intent of Congress, which was to impose on the railroads whatever liability was necessary to make them maintain their equipment in proper condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.017" offset="3127463">And yet look what happens now if the court adapts the reasoning of the respondent in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="765.254" offset="3164348">The railroad is able to turn over a car, a defective car, to an independent third party such as Cargill.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.119" offset="3211891">The railroad knows that it's not going to receive that car back on its tracks for a period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.046" offset="3239581">Now if contributory negligence can be asserted by an employee of that third party, it's very much to the advantage of the railroad to leave that car defective, leave it defective, wait till it gets back on its lines because if the injury occurs in the interim, they're going to have a lot easier time of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.580" offset="3309693">How could that possibly have been the intent of Congress?</text>
            <text syncTime="804.586" offset="3321710">Congress' intent must have been to require the railroad to fix this equipment at the earliest possible time and to impose whatever liability that required them to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.680" offset="3366118">And look what other results followed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.043" offset="3379493">In this case, the trial court not only placed the burden upon Mr. Crane to prove by a preponderance or a greater weight of the evidence that he was not guilty of contributory negligence, but listen to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.965" offset="3443231">It instructed that if his contributory negligence contributed in any way or in any degree directly to the injury, he could not recover at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.749" offset="3498402">Now, what happens?</text>
            <text syncTime="850.875" offset="3506866">Mr. Crane thus winds up with less chance of recovery even though the railroad violated the Safety Act then if one of the railroad's own employees had been injured and the railroad had been guilty only of simple negligence, not even of a violation of the Safety Act because in that case, the employee could recover diminished damages but at least damages of some kind whereas in -- in this case, the employee of the third party can't recover at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.140" offset="3643956">And we just submit that that could not possibly have been the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.378" offset="3660884">That the intent was entirely the other way, because if it's one thing these two Act show if they're read together it's that Congress was concerned primarily about violations of the Safety Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.934" offset="3711143">That's what it was concerned about if you compare the statutes every time the Safety Act is mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.359" offset="3736848">Liability grows greater, the standards become stricter.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.376" offset="3748864">That's what they were concerned about, the thousands of deaths and injuries that were occurring because equipment was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.367" offset="3788884">Now the type of interpretation that we seek here is certainly nothing new to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.335" offset="3812707">Time and again this Court has read the literal language of the Act in the light of the overall writing intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.716" offset="3846248">In once case for example, although the Act only refers to couplers coupling automatically by impact and uncoupling without the necessity of going between cars, this Court required in addition that the couplers remained coupled until set free by some purposeful act of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.705" offset="3926183">That wasn't in the statute, but this Court added it because it thought that that was the plain meaning of Congress in passing the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.633" offset="3961919">In another case, the court struck the fellow servant defense from Safety Act cases, even though the Act itself made no reference whatever to the fellow servant rule, and the Court said the obvious purpose of the legislature was to supplant the qualified duty of the common law with an absolute duty deemed by it nor just.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.853" offset="4058781">In still another case, it was argued that the Safety Act made clear by its various provisions that it applied only to railroad workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.386" offset="4096920">And this Court held it applicable to motorist on the highway as well who came across the tracks and any one else as a matter fact who were properly on the railroads properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.011" offset="4139447">And still again the court ruled that assumption of risk was just as applicable to employees of a connecting carrier as it was to the defendant railroad, even though the assumption of risk provision would seem to have been applicable only to employees of the guilty carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.387" offset="4200887">And in that case, it's interesting that the Court relied on both FELA and the Safety Act even though the case was brought only under the Safety Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.673" offset="4246026">Now this brings me to the point that has been emphasized by the court so strongly many times, and that is that the Safety Act and FELA are really correlative, interdependent, interrelated statutes, each gain sustenance from the other, each must be read in the light of the other and we say that the specific abolition of the defense of contributory negligence in FELA permeates the entire Safety Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.412" offset="4381027">In other words, so long as the injured party is one who is covered by the Safety Act, which is clearly the case, concededly the case here, the railroad should not be able to use contributory negligence to defeat him any more that it can now use assumption of risk to defeat him or the fellow servant doctrine to defeat him.</text>

            <text syncTime="1226.903" offset="5010996">Yes, although I might put it a little differently, I would say that I'm asking you to realize that Congress could not possibly have met to discriminate against non-railway employees leaving these two statutes together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.068" offset="5067630">It could not possibly have met to allow a railroad employee to recover, and a non-railroad employee properly upon the property, properly working on these cars not to recover under precisely the same circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.810" offset="5126562">I think Congress's intent, if you read these two statutes together as the Court have said you must do, is clearly to impose as the Court itself have said absolute liability in either instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.522" offset="5185494">In the (Inaudible) case, it was not under FELA either Your Honor, and yet the Court said there was absolute liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="1363.668" offset="5558000">Well the FELA of course was passed later, passed in 1908, and the -- and that statute provides as you know simply that once the Safety Appliance Act is violated that contributory negligence goes out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.767" offset="5618395">This Court has gone on in later cases to make clear the class of people who are covered by the Safety Appliance Act greatly broadening it, and that we simply say that this Court has recognized that you're not going to discriminate when you read these two cases -- these two Acts together unless you find specific congressional intent to rule out this kind of interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.402" offset="5716929">And we certainly find no legislative history of any kind indicating any attempt to discriminate against or make the burden greater for the non-railroad employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.894" offset="5762905">I grant Your Honor that perhaps would not be beyond the power of Congress to do so, but the point of it is that we can't find any indication that they did intend to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.008" offset="5811388">Now we pointed in our brief to all kinds of defenses that the states could use and they're presently using in their state cases in ordinary negligence actions to defeat claims by plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.526" offset="5857468">And if all these are applicable in the respective states under this federal statute, we say it's going to encourage exactly what Congress was attempting to frustrate namely a spotty and differing recovery in each state under this federal statue depending upon whether the local rule happens to be stringent or liberal in the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.159" offset="5952031">So in summary we say that absent, the specific intent to discriminate that the courts use of the term absolute liability in recent years in these cases was purposeful that so long is there is a defect as there clearly was here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.880" offset="6030921">So long as there is a cause or relationship between the defect and the injury that liability automatically follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.923" offset="6063104">We submit that we're long past the day when an employee merely because of some negligent act no matter how slight, thereby excludes himself from all recovery under remedial legislation of this kind.</text>

            <text syncTime="1519.705" offset="6182222">Your Honor put the finger on the very pulse of this problem here and the question is and the Honorable Court decided it on the basis that this was an action brought by a nonemployee of the railroad and that only on those instances were the action was brought by a railroad employee, was the plaintiff entitled to claim the benefits of the Federal Employer's Liability Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.157" offset="6296012">And the court cited the many, many cases that had been decided by this Court which held that contributory negligence was a defense in all of those actions except for the Federal Employer's Liability Act was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.383" offset="6376887">And what we in effect have here is an endeavor to reverse a construction of the Federal Employer's Liability Act that has been existent for almost 60 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.767" offset="6438431">The very first case that this Court had occasioned to pass on the Federal Safety Appliance Act was the first -- was the Schlemmer case, it was decided in 220 U.S, and that was an action that involved an injury to a railroad employee in a situation where the injury occurred prior to the time of the adoption of the Federal Employer's Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.918" offset="6551071">The case was tried to a jury in the state court and the jury returned the verdict in favor of the plaintiff under instructions with respect to contributory negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.482" offset="6605302">The state trial court granted the judgment not withstanding the verdict on the theory that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.714" offset="6650232">It was then appealled to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and they held that the plaintiff under the -- the dissident in that case under the facts of that particular case was guilty of contributory negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.493" offset="6701328">As a matter of law and said in this -- and then the case came here, this Court said the contributory negligence continues as a defense unless it is taken away by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.125" offset="6759842">There was no statute at the time this action occurred which took it away therefore it continues to be a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.315" offset="6792652">Now I want to just say a word or two about that Schlemmer case because of the contentions that are made with respect to it in petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.887" offset="6834970">They say that this Court has misinterpret over the many years the true import of the Schlemmer opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.418" offset="6877080">Now the Schlemmer case all very definitely discusses what is contributory negligence?</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.658" offset="6909994">Namely the failure of a party to take those precautions for his own safety that another reasonably prudent person would under the same or similar circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.408" offset="6953044">Now they say applying that rule to the facts of that case, the state court was correct in concluding that the dissident failed to take those precautions and he was not entitled to recover because contributory negligence continued to be a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.834" offset="7034755">Now the next case that we have after that arose under the Act of 1893 which was the original Federal Safety Appliance Act then in 1908 we have the Federal Employer's Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.622" offset="7105912">But as you recall under the Federal Employer's Liability Act as it was first enacted, it only covered those employees who were actually engaged in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.064" offset="7151679">So the person could be a railroad employee and if his activities at the time of his injury were intrastate activities then he was not entitled to the benefits of the Federal Employer's Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.604" offset="7209775">So he stood in the same posture with respect to his claim that the ordinary individual who was not a railroad employee he was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.980" offset="7243316">We had a series of cases that articulated the import of the Schlemmer case, applied that rule, carried it on and held that insofar as the Federal Safety Appliance Act was concerned, of course a federal question was presented as to what its proper construction was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.520" offset="7329416">What they said that an injured party who was not entitled to the benefits of the Federal Employers Liability Act did not have a federally created cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.499" offset="7373406">That this duty to have cars equipped with those appliances which were in conformity with the Safety Appliance Act was an absolute duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.607" offset="7417814">The only effect of the Federal Safety Appliance Act was to substitute a strict and absolute obligations specified by statute in lieu of the ordinary common law obligation to maintain your cars in a reasonably safe condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.108" offset="7483852">Now true and from the very beginning, this Court has held that that is a absolute requirement, impose an absolute duty to comply over those strict requirements of the Federal Safety Appliance Act and its obligation that cannot be avoided by any degree of care no matter however assiduous as Justice Hughes, the Chief Justice Hughes said in the Brady case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.458" offset="7597223">So we come into a situation here when we start out any person injured as a result of a defective federal appliance, it doesn't make any difference who that person is, is entitled to the benefits of that Federal Safety Appliance Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.296" offset="7660544">He may be a person approaching the railroad, crossing it, may be a man climbing on a car, any person as you very, very distinctly said who needs the protection of that Federal Safety Appliance Act is entitled to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.792" offset="7722506">And that duty is an absolute duty in one that can result in a situation where a person injured can impose liability upon a railroad without fault, and you can have a situation here where you, as we say under the facts of this very case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.927" offset="7799097">If liability were to be imposed here, it would be without fault on that part of the Cedar Rapids and Iowa City Railroad because at that the time these cars were delivered, they were firmly coupled together at the time they were uncoupled by these men who were employees of Cargill for the purpose of weighing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.576" offset="7881644">The couplers were functioning in perfect order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.362" offset="7896795">It was no dispute but what these cars at the time they were delivered were in absolute perfect condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.209" offset="7932217">Now, we have a situation here where this case was brought as it could be in three counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.436" offset="7961161">One, ordinary common law negligence for delivering a car that was not equipped with proper couplers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.298" offset="7988537">Two, failure to deliver the car that was in conformity with the Federal Safety Appliance Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1993.704" offset="8078190">The jury were to found that there had been any negligence on the part of the railroad company in delivering those cars, that verdict would not have had any support in the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.541" offset="8117582">So the case proceeded to trial on this single count before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.708" offset="8154154">Now in connection with the situation as it presented, there it was urged throughout the trial, that contributory negligence was not a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.623" offset="8205876">And when the District Court or the trial court held that it -- contributory negligence was available as a defense then the petitioner requested a so-called emergency instruction which told the jury that they found that the plaintiff was confronted with a sudden emergency so that he was required to act under circumstances, or he didn't have time for adequate deliberation then he would not be held to that degree of care that a person would be who was not confronted with such an emergency, but he would only be required to use that care for his own safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.248" offset="8372328">That a reasonably prudent person would be required to use under the same or similar circumstance, so we have a fair, fair submission, it's not any lopsided submission at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.166" offset="8420080">The Iowa Court said that the instructions with respect to contributory negligence were in full conformity with the Iowa law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.533" offset="8453517">Now you're not going to find that instruction in there Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.083" offset="8467728">You'll find it set out in my -- in our brief in the statement of facts certainly, and they did not set it out here and I'm reading it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.197" offset="8500120">I set it out here on page 4 of the brief for respondent, this is the instruction that they requested and this is what was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.256" offset="8540348">When one is confronted with a sudden emergency not brought about by his own fault and because the railroad is required to act upon the impulse of the moment without sufficient time to determine with certainty the best course to pursue is not held to the same accuracy of judgment as would be required of him who had time for deliberation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.538" offset="8625507">Under such circumstances, he was required to act only as an ordinarily careful and prudent person would act when suddenly placed in the similar position, and he'd be so acts he is not liable for injury or damage resulting from his conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="2722.532" offset="10993455">But here, to put it this way, the -- in the Fairport case, which is the first case that where a person approached a railroad crossing and he was struck by train that didn't have the proper power brakes as required by Section 1 of the Federal Safety Appliance Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.068" offset="11091675">Then the question got into the case as to whether contributory negligence of this person approaching the railroad crossing would be a defense, or more properly speaking, in that case whether last search chance was available to avoid the consequences of failure to use proper precautions when approaching the crossing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.354" offset="11196792">And this is what Justice Sullivan in that Fairport case, he said, "The effect of the Federal Safety Appliance Act is to transform a common law duty to use ordinary care into an absolute duty which is imposed by statute"</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.168" offset="11268054">And that absolute duty cannot be escaped by a showing of care on the part of the railroad, but that's only in one side of the aspect, he has to look further to the state law to -- the right as they say springs from the state law to recover.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.873" offset="11334823">So they must look to the state law to see whether the state law permits or whether he's got approximate causation or whether he has --</text>

            <text syncTime="3019.801" offset="12182549">And you have said that that Federal Safety Appliance Act provided a -- or protection to whoever got hurt as a result of it and that's been the whole import of the Federal Safety Appliance Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.497" offset="12249318">It was not a statue that was enacted for the benefit of any railroad employees alone or any particular person who might be doing any particular thing if the time he was injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.211" offset="12300204">In other words it was a broad thing to protect the public generally against injuries as you -- as the Court said in that case from any defective appliance that was used and then -- so then we start out here that every member of the public, it's not a statute of the type that you have -- not a case in where you have a statute enacted for the benefit of minors, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.513" offset="12401455">And you -- now you say well you can't plead contributory negligence in that because that -- this is a statute, as they say it's enacted for the benefit of those people who aren't able to protect themselves, that's the general type.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.863" offset="12454849">Now this statute has never been protected -- has never been construed in that aspect at all, so that you have a situation where you must look further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.832" offset="12506676">Now, I see my time is fast passing, I want to just say a word for concluding about the Shields case here, which is the case to which Mr. Prettyman has referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.355" offset="12552756">Now that's a case and I have read with very great interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.964" offset="12575222">The official transcript in that case which sets out all the instructions of the trial court and so forth, and I think that if you follow that case down you'll find everything that he says is true with respect to it, except there was no instruction given in that case by the trial court either oral or written, at least it's not set out in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.901" offset="12675009">With respect to the question of the plaintiff's contributory negligence and they tried this case both on two counts, one on common law negligence and the other on the violation of the Federal Safety Appliance Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.962" offset="12727254">And there was no instruction on either, and the reason, it's rather obvious because the railroad was endeavoring to make a defense in that case on the theory that the defect on that so-called running board had been painted over so that their inspector as well as the plaintiff couldn't determine whether there was any defect on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.645" offset="12817951">Therefore, they were trying to make a defense on the theory that they couldn't know about it and the plaintiff couldn't either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.923" offset="12847104">And so the case went to the jury and the jury returned the verdict for the plaintiff on both counts, and then when it got to the Court of Appeals and you'll notice on the Fifth Circuit they discussed only the question and they defeated the plaintiff solely on the grounds that this so-called running board was not a safety appliance within the meaning of the Federal Safety Appliance Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.197" offset="12948146">And they dismissed his case then it came here on -- to review in the single question for decision here was whether this so-called dome step or running board was a safety appliance within the meaning of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.167" offset="13016064">That caused the further problem as to whether he had to be a member of the general public or would he have to be a railroad employee to claim the benefits of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.267" offset="13060472">And the court said that this was a safety appliance that ended that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.590" offset="13093700">Then the next they said, well, he was a member who was entitled to the protection of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.832" offset="13114702">And that is here where we get the language that's been the subject matter of our haggling, therefore the liability is absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.453" offset="13149184">Now there wasn't any intention we say in that case to reverse these earlier cases at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.277" offset="13176456">In fact the court as one of the cases cited is the Fairport case which very definitely and specifically held that last clear chance was available as a -- it was a local problem, it didn't present a federal question at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.483" offset="13249285">Therefore you have a situation where we say that that case is not -- there was no issue of contributory negligence in that case at all when it reached this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.205" offset="13292231">And there wasn't any in it -- on it -- reached the Fifth Circuit, because when you read over the instructions, you'll find that the court never gave an instruction on contributory negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.190" offset="13336116">True as Mr. Prettyman says, the railroad accepted to the court in instructing the -- or that the contributory negligence would not constitute a defense, but there wasn't any such instruction given there, if it wasn't, never got into the printed record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.040" offset="13415528">So Your Honors, we submit that the Iowa Court was correct in the concluding that contributory negligence was available on the defense through an action by a non-railroad employee and that these cases were correctly decided, and that there's been no reason why the rule should not be followed as it was before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.647" offset="13522004">And to ask the Court to remedy a situation now that has existed for 60 years, we say is a matter for Congress rather than for the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3576.072" offset="14407659">Yes, my -- it's my position that it was in Shields.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.631" offset="14421870">It was pleaded in Shields, it was clearly presented, I contend in the instructions to Shields at least they objected to the instruction that the contributory negligence was deemed not to be a defense in that case, and Shields was solely under the Safety Appliance Act, not under FELA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.899" offset="14506924">Not it's my position that FELA chose the way only in terms to the legislative intent to make this Act one of absolute liability and that in no other way can you possibly carry out the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.178" offset="14584038">If you're going to say that is the federal standard that contributory negligence applies, if the state says so, you end up with a case like this one where a jury is allowed to conclude that if there was contributory negligence in any way or in any degree, this man gets nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.427" offset="14653106">I say that could not conceivably have been the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.040" offset="14671496">And Your Honor, the only thing I would note in addition to that is that there was a mention of this emergency instruction in an attempt to show that really what went to jury was fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.639" offset="14729906">I need only say that we clearly told the court that that instruction was given solely because with our contributory negligence argument had been rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.228" offset="14768253">If you're going to talk about unfairness, let's look at this man who had been employed for six months, who admittedly was not a railroad worker, who did not know anything about couplers and yet he is deemed to be contributory negligent because he didn't see the pin drop, or he didn't stretch the cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.010" offset="14835440">That is where the unfairness comes in these cases, and that clearly is not what Congress intended when it said that the railroads had to keep this equipment in effective conditions.</text>
