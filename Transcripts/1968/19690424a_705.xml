            <text syncTime="29.176" offset="220035">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.044" offset="239574">This case presents the question as to whether or not this Court's decision in Harper versus Virginia State Board of Elections applies to a local revenue bond election limited to property taxpayers who have no special interest in the election which would warrant their limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.418" offset="321076">The facts of this case may be briefly stated as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.453" offset="337168">This suit was brought by Joseph Q. Cipriano as a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.532" offset="357543">Mr. Cipriano is a resident of and a duly registered and qualified voter in the City of Houma, Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.497" offset="389308">The plaintiff does not own any real property in the City of Houma nor does he pay any property taxes on any such property.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.662" offset="425984">On October 24, 1967, an election was held pursuant to the statute challenged in this suit to authorize the issuance of utility revenue bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.723" offset="478229">Under the applicable statute, the election was specifically limited to resident, property taxpayers, appellant and all similarly situation -- situated persons who are prohibitive from voting in this election by the effect of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.360" offset="544789">The purpose of the election was to obtain authorization from the electorate to issue $10 million worth of utility revenue bonds with which to expand the utility system of the City of Houma.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.086" offset="595675">The election received a favorable vote by the property taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.688" offset="614170">Of the 11,606 registered voters in the City of Houma, 4,680 are property taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.651" offset="653981">Of that latter number, 2,724 actually voted in this election, 1,828 voted in favor of this proposition, 896 against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.263" offset="708420">The appellant brought this suit within the 60-day period allowed and provided for by Louisiana statute and contesting -- contested the constitutionality of the voter classification or qualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.036" offset="759515">The trial court and the divided opinion with the dissent by Justice Wisdom rejected appellant's contention and from that decision of a three-judge court, the appellant appeals to this Court.</text>

          <turn speaker="kenneth_watkins" startTime="198.980" stopTime="455.980">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth Watkins</label>
            <text syncTime="198.980" offset="899323">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.163" offset="904025">All revenue -- it's important to note that all revenue derived from the operation of the utility system over and above that first revenue dedicated to repaying the bond goes into the general fund of the City of Houma and is used for general city services.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.415" offset="989080">Now we make special note of the fact that this is a utility, revenue bond election as distinguished from bonds which are payable from the proceeds of property or ad valorem taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.907" offset="1034951">The applicable statutes provide that the revenue bonds authorized by this election shall be repaid exclusively and solely from the income derived from the operation of the utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.266" offset="1092420">And we maintain that by this limitation it's conceded effectively precludes or prohibits the imposition or use of any tax money to repay these bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.999" offset="1139336">Additionally, the statutes also provide that the full faith and credit of the issuing authority is not at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.305" offset="1172564">Only the pledged revenues of the utility are allowed to secure the repayment of these bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.777" offset="1202448">As I shall show, a property owner has no greater stake or interest in this election than in nonproperty owner as neither his property nor his property rights can in any way be effected by the outcome of this election.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.100" offset="1259813">Now, the statute of the State of Louisiana which required the ownership of property we maintain therefore invidiously discriminating this instance against the appellant and members of his class who together comprise 60% of the registered voters of the City of Houma.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.019" offset="1323447">Firstly, as I have stated the property owner as such incurs no liability contingent or otherwise for the repayment of the bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.978" offset="1359287">Secondly, as the use of utilities which property owners and nonproperty owners are like used, he encourage no peculiar liability as neither the property owner nor his property is in anyway peculiarly liable for the service or utility charge or for the connection charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.125" offset="1431907">It's a contractual obligation in Louisiana between the user and the supplier.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.579" offset="1453641">And thirdly, if the proposition to be voted on is economically sound and this would result in an increase in revenue over and above the bond repayment funds going into the general city coffers so to speak, this is beneficial to all taxpayers and all residents of the City of Houma.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.730" offset="1538278">If on the other hand, the proposition will approve economically unsound resulting in less money going into the general fund, this would adversely affect all citizens as additional tax money may be necessary to run the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.092" offset="1603688">Since over 90% of the total money generated as revenues for the City of Houma well over 90% come from sources other than property taxes, we maintain that the greater interest lies with that group or classification who pays more than 90% of the funds into the General Treasury of the City and this would be the general electorate and the general citizenry of the City of Houma.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.486" offset="1741302">The property owner, a review of the stipulation of facts at page 19 and 20 of the single appendix, paragraphs 7 and 8, together with the official audit of the City of Houma.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.776" offset="1794487">Now the official annual audit of the City of Houma for the year ending September 30, 1968 shows the gross revenues of the city and this official audit of course covers the period of this election which was October 1967 through that same period in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.848" offset="1866794">When these two items are combined and analyzed, it shows that property owners pay substantially less than 10% of the total revenues of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.861" offset="1902843">We believe that the case of Harper versus Virginia State Board of Elections is controlling in this instance.</text>

            <text syncTime="455.980" offset="1927293">Do you really think that you'd be making the same argument with this with general obligation fund?</text>

            <text syncTime="461.028" offset="1947460">I don't believe it's necessary for me to go that far, Your Honor, in the sense that we can show here that there is absolutely no relevancy and no possibility of attacks being used.</text>

          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="472.039" stopTime="477.323">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="472.039" offset="1991555">But some of your arguments really are applicable to the general obligation fund?</text>

            <text syncTime="477.323" offset="2012662">They may be Your Honor to both.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.430" offset="2021125">But in the Harper case, this Court was consigned with the requirement of the payment of the poll taxes of qualification to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.434" offset="2049128">In this case, we are concerned with the requirement of the payment of a property tax as a qualification to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.693" offset="2078177">In the Harper case, this Court declared that voter qualification has no relation to wealth nor to the paying or not paying of this or any other tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.190" offset="2120182">In fact, we maintain that the present case presents to this Court an easier question than did Harper.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.934" offset="2151111">Now the dissenting justices in Harper suggested that the State of Virginia may have had a valid interest in the poll tax either in deciding to collect additional revenue or in believing that the voters who pay the poll tax comprise a group which may have been more interested in the general welfare of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.202" offset="2240136">Under the facts of the present case, neither of these contentions can be taken seriously here.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.359" offset="2264795">As I have illustrated the property owning taxpayer has no interests in the outcome of the revenue bond election greater than any other voter.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.104" offset="2295829">In fact, as a group, they have decided a less interest as they pay less than 10% of the total revenues of the City of Houma.</text>

            <text syncTime="620.772" offset="2586415">We suggested in our reply brief that the Court may limit the retrospective effect of its decision to those cases where rights have not become final or where bonds have not been issued as an example, I think we may have pointed out Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.072" offset="2647646">If the election had actually been held then full time for challenge had passed and the local authority may have been gone on planning as they must pre-plan, we appreciate that, there would be no manifest ill or no adverse effect by allowing that one to stand since the time for challenging had passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.462" offset="2729253">Obviously, where bonds have been issued the same rule would apply, rights have become vested.</text>

            <text syncTime="807.295" offset="3332577">It's an analogy to the application of this Court of the Mapp decision and the Linkletter case.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.777" offset="3362461">We may additionally point out in this case, Your Honor that not only is the qualification of paying a tax violative of the Fourteenth Amendment as set forth in the Harper case but the -- the qualification of wealth is given added emphasis.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.617" offset="3433827">In this case, the property tax presupposes the ownership of property in addition to the payment of this tax and the degree of wealth is even made a factor in the present case by the statutory requirement that the proposition be voted favorably upon by a majority in number of voters and a majority in the assessed evaluation of the property owned by the voters.</text>

            <text syncTime="910.209" offset="3744162">We submit that if that classification was permissible, it has no relevance or whatsoever to the purpose of this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.376" offset="3776867">To the contrary, the total absence of liability peculiar to the taxpayer or to his property effectively invites him to vote with more or less unrestrained enthusiasm.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.596" offset="3825768">Exhibits P1 through P7 clearly show that the proponents of the bond issued constantly advice the taxpayers that a favorable vote would protect his low property tax rate and no new taxes could be added.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.784" offset="3890552">In the present case, all citizens have an equal proprietary interest in revenues, equal proprietary interest in city owned properties.</text>

            <text syncTime="983.626" offset="4037883">I may call to this Court's attention the fact that a casual comparison if we have set forth in our brief of the three different sections of Chapter 10 of the Title 33 of the Louisiana Revised Statutes indicates that the legislature provided three different methods for submitting the same general proposition to the voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.247" offset="4152404">Subsection B provides for a bond election, subsection D and subsection C -- B, C, and D.</text>

            <text syncTime="1404.718" offset="5722258">Now, before I discuss whether or not the relief or the decision of the Court should be prospective or retrospective, certainly there will be serious nationwide consequences to municipal securities if the retroactivity of this decision goes back totally or even partially.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.840" offset="5802715">Nevertheless, there are few relevant facts which I think this Court should be apprised of and one deals with the statistics set forth in the factual situation before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.650" offset="5857991">Appellant contends that there are 11,600 registered voters but there are only 4,680 registered property taxpayer voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.318" offset="5888606">This 4,600 was taken from the assessment rolls and the registrar's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.765" offset="5910444">Now, Louisiana is a community property state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.180" offset="5924133">Property may be assessed and in most instances is assessed in the name of a husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.439" offset="5941164">But the wife is likewise entitled to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.581" offset="5953703">She will show not up as a property taxpayer voter on the assessment roll.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.870" offset="5970840">Therefore, the argument that there are 6,900 people eligible to vote who could not vote is substantially diluted by the spouses of those registered property taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.621" offset="6013889">And likewise in many instances where property was owned by a parent who is now deceased where the state have not been probated through the courts, the property is still assessed in the (Inaudible) name.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.348" offset="6060805">If they left six or seven children, all six or seven would be entitled to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.787" offset="6078568">So, we submit that the statistics are not wholly correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.211" offset="6092257">There was no way which correct whole legitimate statistics could be provided in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.675" offset="6118066">Furthermore, this plaintiff, this appellant brought this action to enjoin the election and also the issuance of the bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.954" offset="6155160">Now, he brought the action some 55 days after the election was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.824" offset="6174699">The record clearly shows the appellant is the district manager of a private utility operating in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.735" offset="6202284">He said that he did not vote because he felt like the election would be defeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.424" offset="6221093">We go back to the same antagonism here of public versus private power.</text>

            <text syncTime="1627.635" offset="6613870">Therefore, there is a complex system of checks and balances in the issuance of these securities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2829.388" offset="11420923">There are only a few comments I think I would like to make with respect to Mr. Huppenbauer's arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.049" offset="11439522">Number one, I think it's important to point out that these bonds we're talking about in this case are not general obligation bonds contrary to the statistics Mr. Huppenbauer referred to in the amicus brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.611" offset="11501798">Although it didn't reflect it here, the statistics in the amicus brief are somewhat misleading and that that the real gem of this is that no general obligations bonds are here, no tax money can be used, and that the statistics showed in the amicus brief failed to clearly set forth the number of states where the general obligation bonds are not in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.809" offset="11590614">We believe there are only three states in the union as far as we can ascertain from our research: Louisiana, Texas and Idaho that had any requirement even similar to this with a non-general obligation bond in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.932" offset="11639097">With regard to the -- Mr. Huppenbauer's argument on the specter of confusion, gentlemen, it simply does not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.456" offset="11673161">The state law can be made applicable as this Court did in Linkletter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.319" offset="11688626">Whenever the state law determines finality to an issue and at the time under state law has passed to challenge that issue, this is an easy break off point, should the Court decide to use it so to speak.</text>

            <text syncTime="2979.426" offset="12021112">And I'm sure nobody would want to buy a bond where the right matter had not become final as Mr. Huppenbauer had suggested.</text>
