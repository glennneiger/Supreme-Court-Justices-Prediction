            <text syncTime="23.069" offset="92264">Mr. Scott.</text>

            <label>Mr. Grady B. Scott</label>
            <text syncTime="24.693" offset="98743">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.885" offset="111491">This case came to this Court from the District Court of the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.242" offset="136882">The case was heard in the District Court here in Washington before Judges Wright, Robinson, and Gasch.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.148" offset="176588">The opinion of these Justices was a two-judge -- the two of the judges wrote an opinion which we contend first of all was based on a theory that was not justified under the 1965 Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.501" offset="261956">The concurring opinion of Judge Gasch was based on a different theory, a theory that because the Gaston County had failed to maybe offer evidence that we did not discriminate by the use of a test or device in municipal elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.775" offset="343040">The record is amply showed that the municipal elections of course were not under the control of the county board of elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.630" offset="382433">So just to give a brief background, I would like to point out that it was in March of 1966 that we were certified by the Attorney General and subsequently at that time was printed in the Federal Registry and in August of 1966, we filed a suit in the District Court and it was heard here in June 21 and 22 of the following year.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.470" offset="497789">These two opinions after having been handed down, we appeal to this Court in probable jurisdiction was then noted on January 13, 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.315" offset="549198">The three main points that we would like to argue in connection with this case is first of all that Gaston County and the record we contend is replete without offset we at no time have used a test or device to discriminate because of race and color or for any other reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.795" offset="647105">We set out in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.854" offset="659331">We brought witnesses here to Washington both the white and Negro race to show to the court that this particular county in North Carolina was not one that this Act was designed for.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.069" offset="724219">In reading the case, of course of South Carolina against Katzenbach in which the history of this whole Act or the purpose of the Act was set forth in stating that the repressive type of thing that was going on in some other states in the union to at least try to avoid that type of conduct continuing.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.639" offset="814498">We contend that Gaston County does not fall into that same category.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.056" offset="836127">So we then presented evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.013" offset="843964">We brought with us these witnesses who testified orally the Government offered depositions without any oral testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.110" offset="880431">Both parties to the action did offer depositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.332" offset="893283">I believe that the Government offered at 29 depositions plus some other documentary evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.365" offset="925362">We offer depositions of about 9 or 11 people I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.932" offset="951693">Now we first in the record, it will indicate that in 1962, a new registration was adopted in Gaston County and this was a system called a permanent loose-leaf type registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.045" offset="1020134">Until that time, we had had, well I guess it may be at 1940 was the only other time that anything it had been done about the registration books.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.872" offset="1059422">But in 1962, a complete new registration was ordered called the McMillan system and it was by statute that we adopted this system in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.570" offset="1114279">The Chairman of the Board of Elections at that time, starting in April and from April until May of 1962 conducted a registration so that the voters would be eligible to vote in the May primary of 1962 that the evidence will probably indicate that during that short period of time, we registered in our county approximately 30 some thousand people.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.204" offset="1224725">It was a rounded figure, I am not exact about that but approximately 30,000 people which we might say was in a period of approximately 15 days and three Saturdays within that period from April until May about May the 21st.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.420" offset="1289613">Subsequent to that time or prior to that time, however, I want to call the Court's attention to what Gaston County did in order to give every citizen the right to register, to vote, and participate in the election process.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.808" offset="1351158">But first of all the county increased a number of voting precincts from 35 to 44 precincts.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.815" offset="1387207">That of course was to make it more convenient for our people to register and at the same time more convenient for him to be able to vote after they had registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.067" offset="1428167">Under this new system of registration, the election books are kept open everyday of the year from Monday 8:30 a.m. until Friday 5 o'clock each day and that has been done since 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.491" offset="1485949">The record and it was stipulated and agreed that all of our registration process would relate back to that period of time 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.635" offset="1522521">It was a little less than to 5-year period, referred to in the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.200" offset="1548748">So we, an effort to make sure that the people knew about this, the county spent thousands of dollars and that is also in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.432" offset="1597649">We conducted schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.058" offset="1620219">The chairman of the county of board of elections conducted schools for the registrars.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.388" offset="1653551">Many of the registrars who have served in the past were reappointed and of course we had new registrars because of the increase in the number of voting precincts.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.736" offset="1698900">Well all of these registrars attended these schools for the purpose of instructing them under this new system of registration and also to give them what we understood the law to be, the law of the State of North Carolina and the test that we thought at that time would be used and was used and of course until 1964, the all type of tests was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.329" offset="1805270">After the 1964 Civil Rights Act, we changed that test to a written test and we contend that all of this has been in conformity of course with Lassiter versus Northampton County.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.681" offset="1850723">That case has been kicked around by the Attorney General and by us of course in our brief as to what effect there, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 has on the decision in Lassiter versus North Hampton County.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.495" offset="1921881">Now, we contend that that we followed the test that was stated by this Court was one that was not on its face discriminatory and we say that even with the civil -- the Voting Rights Act now of 1965 that there has been no change because the test we used in this county which was a simple that is 1964, a simple test.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.309" offset="2041208">We took what we consider to be the simplest three senators from the North Carolina Constitution and we then would give this to a registrar or a person who had applied to registration and as was testified by the Chairman of the Board of Elections after this test was adopted in 1964 that a person was not required to copy every word of that test or every word of either of the one of the three sentences from the Constitution that he may select but a reasonable fact simply thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.699" offset="2190733">So that was the -- now, even in 1964, I would like to remind the Court that again, before this 1964 election, now the General Election of 1964, we have again the registrar's school in ways of conducting these tests because we were using a different test after 1964 in order to conform with the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.940" offset="2295745">So then we also read many newspaper advertisements at the cost of the county of many thousands of dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.294" offset="2337123">We had radio spot announcements.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.732" offset="2350916">Now we had -- we did everything that we thought reasonable and that reasonable people could do to notify the citizens of Gaston County that they, that we were having a new registration and that we wanted as many as possible to come and register without regard for race, creed, or color.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.225" offset="2424895">Now -- now, we say --</text>

            <text syncTime="938.023" offset="3752020">Now, I pointed out and it said out in the brief that in this case of United States against Texas, and that was which was affirmed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.547" offset="3794129">And that was a vote, that was a poll tax case but in that case, the Government and in everyone of these cases, they have adopted this same approach that because of the segregated facility, United States against Mississippi and United States against Texas that because they were segregated facilities that that in itself has the effect or is discriminatory because of a segregated or a dual school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.394" offset="3925473">Now in the case of United States against Texas, where the Government had this same type of evidence and Judge Thornberry, I believe his name was, stated that he could not take that evidence where there was only a discrepancy of approximately 12% between those who -- the whites who paid the poll tax and the Negro who paid the poll tax and if that was not sufficient in his opinion as a discrepancy to justify saying that the segregated school system was a reason for or was sufficient to justify that they should have to pay a poll tax or not pay a poll tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.309" offset="4101224">Now, I contend that in our situation in Gaston County that we have a discrepancy of 11 some -- 11.1% and that in itself is certainly not evidence of use of a test or device for the purpose of denying or abridging the right of the person to register and vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.510" offset="4197982">Now, one other thing I wanted to -- I'd like to mention to you in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.752" offset="4214909">We -- we brought with us a Negro Schoolman who had been in the public schools of Gaston County since 1932.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.375" offset="4257437">We -- he testified before this Court and he was asked whether he had an opinion as to whether or not the schools since 1932 had sufficient facilities and were equipped to teach a child or a person to read and write well enough to pass this simple test that is in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.069" offset="4340193">Well, he said and his answer was that all of our schools I think, all of them would be able to teach any Negro child to read and to write so that he could read a newspaper, so that he could read any simple material that didn't have any foreign words or extractions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.827" offset="4399229">This has always been true and I don't think there was any, there was an argument anywhere except that that maybe the facilities were different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.750" offset="4430994">But they have been basically able to teach this and this is what they have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.278" offset="4449071">Now the amazing thing to me was that the majority of the court below said this testimony is unpersuasive to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.681" offset="4482717">And just, you might say completely ignore that testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.840" offset="4499331">Well, it was rebutted and under the case of South Carolina against Katzenbach, it says that all the unit needs to do is to submit affidavits and voting officials and then to refute whatever evidence the Government may offer to the contrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1409.874" offset="5639419">We say that the Act itself and when you refer to the definition of a political subdivision as set out in Section 14 (c) (2) of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that the Attorney General was required under the Act to certify to that unit because the county itself had no control over the municipal elections in that -- in our county by virtue of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.813" offset="5759164">We have 11 municipalities I believe as the record would show and we say that since we have no control over these elections, none whatever, now we couldn't say to the registrar by virtue of state law here why you don't do this or this is a type of test you shall or you shall not give.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.679" offset="5850697">The law gave under in our state the right to hold the municipal elections to the municipality itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.675" offset="5894687">And I want to mention at this point that the Attorney General entered into a consent judgment with white county which is a county right here, right in our own state.</text>

            <text syncTime="1504.582" offset="6018299">So yet they say the white county, the fact that you had a segregated school system doesn't affect you but now Gaston County it does.</text>

            <text syncTime="1918.514" offset="7674044">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.090" offset="7688359">If I may, I'd like at the outset to try to put this case in a somewhat different perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.643" offset="7718557">It seems to me and brought to remember that we are dealing here with the literacy test that was never meant to serve any purpose of assuring a literate electorate but which was admittedly even boastfully invented and conceived for the sole purpose of keeping the franchise entirely in white heads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.853" offset="7811344">Of that of course was a long time ago and the literacy test has worked its purpose in that respect for something over half a century.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.967" offset="7855856">But we're also dealing with the test to which for these reasons the Congress recently isolated as the presumptive cost or a presumptive cost of the low Negro registration in the areas covered by the Act including Gaston County, North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.429" offset="7929626">And the question now is whether after this history in light of the purpose and effect of this literacy provision, we may safely assume that if the prohibition were lifted, the literacy test would cease to have a discriminatory effect on voting in the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.350" offset="8025339">It seems to me that in light of this, the presumption must be against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.413" offset="8049580">Now it is true that North Carolina in Gaston County in particular have made the very important progress, dramatic progress in this area by comparison to some other areas that I'm more intimately familiar with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.549" offset="8118126">It is notable that Negro registration in 1964 was at about 50% of those who are potentially eligible within the county and the record clearly reflects that commendable efforts were made at least in Gastonia of the City of Gaston County which includes about a third of the population toward encouraging Negro registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.268" offset="8233064">But the Court should not believe that all is well in the best of all possible worlds in Gaston County.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.168" offset="8264620">It is a fact that until 1965, every registrar of voters was white and in that year, one out of 44 was a Negro appointed however only to handle registration in the predominantly Negro section of Gastonia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.225" offset="8348839">It is also revealing that as late as 1966 when the school, the high school has been referred to here which was under the -- of which the Negro principal, the witness of the trial that high school was sought to be integrated by assigning to it 300 white students and 300 black students, 297 of the white students transferred out living only three of them in the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.326" offset="8489273">And finally, though I don't want to put my chances on this because we're dealing with an elderly man but he is still a registrar of voters in Gaston County.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.923" offset="8531592">Certainly the millennium has not come to this place when in this record we read the registrar voters talking about those who use registered of the Negro race as good niggers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.616" offset="8590420">One wonders whether they'd be registered at all if it been otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.232" offset="8620826">Now on the other hand, it would be unfair to condemn Gaston County because of the sins of the fathers or grandfathers of those who are now the officials of that place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.527" offset="8682057">But it would be equally improper and unfair to ignore what subsist of the influence of the past on the presence that is after all the scheme of the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.795" offset="8747154">It is not so much or not entirely a question of the present purpose of the present officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.331" offset="8777247">It is a question of the effect and effect alone is sufficient to prevent the reinstatement of these test and devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.163" offset="8812565">Of the effect that these tests and devices have had in the recent past and also what the effect would be if they were allowed to be brought back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.480" offset="8869825">So, we get down to the question whether the influence of the past has really been swept away with respect to voting in Gaston County.</text>

            <text syncTime="2302.177" offset="9208686">And even that is a rather optimistic assumption because discrimination for the better part of the century as this Court well knows is not always so quickly quite a way.</text>

            <text syncTime="2460.571" offset="9842207">That would raise the question under the Fifteenth Amendment quite independent of the Voting Rights Act but there are differences between merely having the literacy test suspended in coming out from under the Act and come out from one of the Act and be free to enact new laws, Section 5 of the Act which this Court tells recently is not operative in the circumstance nor can federal examiners or federal observers be sent down to the county.</text>
