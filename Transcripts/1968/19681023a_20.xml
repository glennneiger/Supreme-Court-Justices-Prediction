            <text syncTime="59.258" offset="340407">The question for decision is whether tenants in federally financed projects, operated under the United States Housing Act of 1937 as amended, may be evicted from their homes and their federal benefits terminated without being told any reason or given any opportunity to be heard in their own defense before the decision to evict is made by the Housing Authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.316" offset="452629">Now, let me emphasize at the outset that, in our view, the fundamental underlying question here is whether poor people who depend on the government for the necessities of life, for shelter, whether poor people will get the same kind of procedural rights and protections that our citizen -- that our system has long given to more fortunate citizens and their contacts with government administrators.</text>

            <text syncTime="182.885" offset="834957">Let's suppose that the Department of the Interior has a -- lent a lease with a concessionaire to occupy premises in a park area, and the lease says that it's terminable, that this is a month-to-month lease and it's terminable upon 30 days notice, and there's no provision for notice or a hearing or a statement of the reason why the lease isn't being renewed.</text>

            <text syncTime="256.290" offset="1128573">Well, I don't think that's important, Mr. Nabrit and this is a terrible important and new area of Constitutional Law to which you're addressing yourself now.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.153" offset="1183953">And, whether it is appropriate to analyze it in terms of giving the poor people rights that are given to their more fortunate fellow citizens or not is a problem of the utmost consequence, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.881" offset="1258872">It's a matter of developing cons -- the developing application of constitutional principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.353" offset="1292831">And I, myself, believe that it's one that, and I'm sure you agree with me, that requires the most prayerful and careful analysis on the part of us and, perhaps, the game is not advanced when we merely refer it -- when we present a case like this in terms of equalizing the rights of the poor, vice versa the government, with the rights of the rich because you first have to establish, if I may respectfully suggest it to you, you first have to establish that there is a cognate or analogous right given to more fortunate citizens, vice versa their government.</text>

            <text syncTime="352.298" offset="1512573">Well, I agree that these issues about the rights of the poor are a challenge to us all, but there are none without difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.224" offset="1552280">Let's look at the position of the Housing Authority in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.722" offset="1570252">They claim, after all that's transpired, after three years of this litigation, they still maintain that they don't even have to have a reason, they don't have to have any cause to evict a low-income family from its home.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.966" offset="1627199">They claim that they have no duty to tell the town anything or listen to anything that the tenant has to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.692" offset="1654157">Their position is, in some, is that these destitute people who pend on -- who depend on the government for shelter don't have any rights, that the auth -- procedural rights that authority is bound to respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.591" offset="1713716">Say I think it is relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.395" offset="1720926">The point is not lost on poor people and that they do understand what's going on when the legal system treats them this way.</text>

            <text syncTime="413.970" offset="1759274">Mr. Nabrit, I'm going to leave you alone after this, but it's a problem of fundamental consequence in this and other cases, many other cases, and I suggest to you that perhaps two possible lines of approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.105" offset="1827819">One is, it's sort of a Gideon line of the discrimination between the poor and the rich with respect to essential governmental rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.156" offset="1875989">The other, and it may be, and this is for you to argue and not for me.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.553" offset="1897618">If -- and, it may be the one that's applicable to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.380" offset="1912874">The other is that in this kind of governmental activity, that is to say the rental of residential property whether it's middle-income, high-income, or low-income, the government takes on certain responsibilities as a constitutional matter which a private landlord does not have.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.437" offset="2029171">I don't know whether that's right or wrong, but what I'm suggesting to you is the possibility that that may be the basic premise to which one must address for himself.</text>

            <text syncTime="495.411" offset="2084968">Mr. Justice Fortas, I think I agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.265" offset="2092387">I don't contend that there's a major equal protection component to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.738" offset="2114330">I think it's a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.325" offset="2120704">Of the principal problem in the case is what sort of procedures due process requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.642" offset="2141915">When the government is landlord, it deals with people.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.219" offset="2156231">I don't disagree with that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.572" offset="2165635">Let's begin with a few words about this Federal Law, the Housing Act of 1937, so that we have a statutory frame of reference for the consti -- to discuss the constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.766" offset="2234389">The Congress has declared that the policy of using federal funds and credit to remedy the unsafe and unsanitary housing conditions and their acute shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings for families of low-income.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.120" offset="2299904">Now, Housing in this particular program is provided only for families “who are in the lowest income group and cannot afford to pay enough to cause private enterprise to build an adequate supply of decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings for their use.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.476" offset="2369285">Now, the subsidies in this program, although it's operated by Local Housing Authorities, the subsidies are almost entirely 100% federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.847" offset="2406797">The permanent financing of these projects is done by bonds sold by the local authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.080" offset="2435741">And if the Federal Law subsidizes these bonds in several ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.983" offset="2451310">First, they make the interest n the bonds federally tax-exempt which has the effect of lowering the interest rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.647" offset="2486000">Then, the Government of the United States places its credit, the credit of the United States, to assure the payment of the bonds and under an annual contributions contract with the local authorities, the United States agrees to pay up to 100% on the debt service on the bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.561" offset="2573667">The local authorities apply their net receipts to the payment of the debt service and any difference the United States makes up.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.093" offset="2615777">With some projects, the United States does pay 100% of the debt service.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.750" offset="2646392">In addition, the United States makes ca -- additional cash contributions for elderly families and on account on displaced families, families displaced by federal projects and, finally, the United States pays the administrative cost of the Housing Assistance Administration, a part of HAA itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.341" offset="2724760">Now, the State and Local Governments, rather than subsidizing the projects, in some case actually gain revenue from there by receiving payments in lieu of local real estate taxes from these housing authorities which, under the statute, may amount to up to 10% of the rental income of the projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.708" offset="2806157">There are now 2.6 million people in the United States living in these federally assisted projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.786" offset="2838549">Perhaps a quarter of a million of them have moved in these projects since this case was last argued here a year-and-a half ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.934" offset="2867075">The program is rapidly expanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.591" offset="2877733">About half of these people are Black, about a third of them are elderly, their medium-family income is little over $2,700, and the average rent they pay is about $50 and those figures are for 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.277" offset="2952443">Of The petitioner was found eligible as she moved into her apartment at $29 a month in November of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.543" offset="3001553">Her lease gave -- her lease was a month-to-month tenancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.237" offset="3024332">It gave both the tenant and the Authority the right to terminate by giving 15 days notice before the end of any month, and she lived in the project without any incident for 8-9 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.375" offset="3076890">In August -- on August 10, to be precise, of 1965, Mrs. Thorpe was elected president of a tenant's organization that was being organized in the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.344" offset="3120776">And, the very next day, the authority sent her a notice that her lease was terminated at the end of that month.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.684" offset="3150137">Several times she asked for a hearing, she was told only that the authority was not required to give a reason for -- or a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.318" offset="3184619">And, when she did not move out, this present suit for summary eviction was brought in the State Courts which ordered her eviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.670" offset="3226102">The State Supreme Court ruled on the first appeal that the lease was terminated the ter -- because the term had expired that the auth -- that the reason the Authority terminated was immaterial and this Court granted review during the October term 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.548" offset="3305514">After argument here in this Court, a year-and-a half ago, the case was remanded to the Court below to reconsider it in view of a supervening event in administrative direction directive circular issued by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which directed that tenants not be given notices to vacate without being told the reasons and an opportunity to reply or explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.988" offset="3415333">On remand, the Court below again affirmed stating that its prior judgme -- its prior opinion stood.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.307" offset="3448560">It stood by it and ruling that the circular was inapplicable because issued after the lease, the termination notice, and the Court orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.609" offset="3489834">So, Mrs. Thorpe remains in her apartment under stay orders issued throughout these appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="965.414" offset="3965053">Now, as I said at the beginning, it seems to us that it's a common place in Administrative Law that governmental agencies grant notice and hearings before taking actions which significantly disadvantage a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.204" offset="4080201">Particularly, this is true where the action is based on what amounts to adjudication that a citizen is guilty of misconduct, in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.694" offset="4130147">Our tradition of due process rejects the idea of ex parte kind of missions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.057" offset="4159613">Mr. Justice Frankfurter once put it that fairness can rarely be obtained by secret one-sided determinations of facts decisive of rights, and the Court has applied that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.226" offset="4224293">The Court has applied that principle in numerous cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.282" offset="4244459">As recently as a few terms ago, a case called Willner against the Committee on Character and Fitness, the principle was applied to a lawyer who was -- whose profess -- whose right to practice law was at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.412" offset="4300988">It was applied as long ago -- it was applied to Meat Packers, as long as -- ago as the famous Morgan cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.267" offset="4332440">The same principle was true to the engineer that was denied a security clearance and, therefore, whose right to earn a living was at stake in Greene against McElroy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.263" offset="4372459">So, I emphasize here that the issue in this case is primarily, I think, a question of procedural due process, to use Mr. Justice Brandeis' phrase, “due process in the primary sense of an opportunity to be heard and to defend.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.109" offset="4439855">I think the case does not involve whether there's a right to public housing for all -- for all the poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.280" offset="4472456">Think it does not necessarily involve even what grounds might justify evictions but, rather, only what procedures due process of law requires if benefits are to be terminated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2732.006" offset="11031385">The statute, the Housing -- United States Housing Act of 1937 did provide that HUD could issue certain general rules and regulations to implement the chapter -- the provisions of the chapter, but it also provided in there, just as clear as it could be, that it should deal with Housing Authority stet up -- set up under the state law, as this one was under the state statute, by entering into a contract with them, which is called an annual contributions contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.314" offset="11168580">It wasn't given the power by any statute to run the Housing Authority setup under the State Law by idict or by rule or by regulation, absent a contract with that agency, that hou -- local Housing Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.073" offset="11231692">Had to have a contract, annual contributions contract, and that's in their general power to make rules and regulations was within the framework of the concept that their sole control over this local Housing Authority was by virtue of the contract for annual contributions that it entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.817" offset="11318627">And, they had to put the provisions in that contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="2810.085" offset="11343705">The petitioner, in preparing this case, directed certain inquiries to her with reference to the s -- the February 7, 1967 circular, and received some answers from HUD in response to their inquiry.</text>

            <text syncTime="2833.742" offset="11438373">Back in the back part of the brief is the pertinent one that I would like to call the Court's attention to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.862" offset="11470869">There, HUD says, HUD policy over the years has been to treat the local Housing Authorities as contracting parties under the annual contributions contract not covered by the term “public.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2883.641" offset="11637948">And, the Housing Act didn't require that there'd be inserted in the annual contributions contract any controlling features about eviction or what sort of lease should given to the tenants, and the annual contributions contract itself contain no such provisions.</text>
