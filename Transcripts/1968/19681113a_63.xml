            <text syncTime="21.326" offset="188688">This case is here on appeal from the judgment of the State of Ohio which construed as consistent with the Constitution of the United States a charter amendment to the City of Akron.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.933" offset="243127">The amendment is number 137 and then set out at page 37 of our record.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.294" offset="268518">And this charter amendment requires that before any legislation designed to regulate housing, real property on the basis of race is enacted that it has to be approved by majority of the electorate.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.751" offset="326405">Moreover, it asserts that any legislation which had been adopted with this making this regulation would cease to be effective until approved by the majority of the electorate.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.945" offset="387114">The -- we contend that Section 137 is inconsistent with the Fourteenth Amendment requirements and must fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.198" offset="424208">The facts are not in dispute and are reasonably uncomplicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.533" offset="449494">In July of 1964, the City Council of Akron enacted a fair housing ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.402" offset="480946">It made findings of fact that it had certain of its citizens were required to live in segregated conditions and under unhealthy and unsanitary and unsafe conditions because of housing discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.593" offset="537788">And these kinds of discrimination produced various social evils which were addressed to the health and well-being of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.878" offset="574882">It therefore established the Commission with power to investigate on complaints of housing discrimination and to make findings and to order compliance with the relief of the discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.429" offset="625037">It also directed the city -- the director of -- the law director of the city to take appropriate action when the order of the Commission was not followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.377" offset="672893">All housing was covered by this.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.133" offset="679894">All housing that was intended as residential housing was covered by this ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.500" offset="705390">The -- on August the 23rd, petitions were filed pursuant to in the initiation process which is provided by the city charter and pursuant to that, a sufficient number of signatures were secured and the petition 137 went on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.392" offset="804968">It was voted upon at the November 23, 1964 Election and it was adopted by majority of citizens.</text>

            <text syncTime="216.493" offset="969331">I know that the charter was adopted by a vote of something like 69,000 to 44,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.300" offset="1012590">In January of 1965, the appellant filed a complaint, made a complaint of housing discrimination and requested the Commission which had been set up pursuant under this ordinance to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.791" offset="1070582">The Commission refused to act and she then went to the law director.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.584" offset="1085733">The law director refused to act and these proceedings therefore commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.947" offset="1107153">After those, some various procedural problems involved and they were cleared away which I don't think it's germane to this -- to the argument of this appeal and then the matter was defended and pressed on the merits and on the merits, the city defended and said that the ordinance was no longer active because of the -- this amendment Section 137 which I have indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.991" offset="1231287">The Ohio Supreme Court held that the 137 was a classification but it contended that it was reasonable because it says that a city in singling out housing -- racial regulation of housing on racial grounds for special treatment is not acting arbitrarily because of the fact that this is a highly emotional field and therefore it indicated that this was a reasonable judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.525" offset="1353435">We contend that under the decisions of this Court that opinion of the Supreme Court of Ohio cannot stand is inconsistent with the opinion of this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1740.982" offset="7067251">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.623" offset="7081880">Perhaps first, I should say a word to explain the presence of the United States in this case which is perhaps another way of addressing myself to the question whether the case is moot or whether it's lost its practical importance because of the intervening passage of the state law of Ohio which Mr. Justice Fortas referred to or the federal law of both the 1866 Act that was recently been indicated in Jones and Mayer, or the Civil Rights Act of 1868.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.258" offset="7220433">It is our view that these intervening events do not in any technical sense make this case moot because they do not provide the remedy sought by this particular plaintiff in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.401" offset="7297024">As Mr. Carter pointed out, the Ohio law does not reach a refusal to sell or to rent a private dwelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.278" offset="7336521">It does reach some discrimination by those engaged in lending or in advertising or in furnishing commercial services with respect to the sale of private housing but the fundamental complaint here that certain housing was unavailable to Mrs. Hunter is not a remedy which she can obtain under the Ohio law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.216" offset="7440280">As for the new federal law of 1868 law, it does not as of now provide any remedy with respect to what I assume to be a single family house which is what Mrs. Hunter was looking for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.594" offset="7509765">Indeed, it's not clear that the new federal law will ever provide a remedy against the kind of discrimination alleged here by the realtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.368" offset="7548844">Federal law does or will in a year from now provide a remedy against the realtor who misrepresents the availability of certain housing to a particular race or class but if he correctly represents the owner's desire not to sell it may not be a violation of the federal act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.901" offset="7642990">The 1866 Act does cover the fundamental complaint here, in that it reaches all housing, indeed all property discriminations on the ground of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.802" offset="7694608">But it does not furnish any administrative remedy and that it seems to us is the importance of this case and of other cases like this no other law, neither the Ohio law nor either of the federal laws can give Mrs. Hunter what she wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.386" offset="7784887">What she wants is that the Akron, Ohio Commission, the local commission easily accessible to her on which sit local leaders committed by their local ordinance to eliminating racial discrimination in housing in their community, shall act, shall investigate and if necessary shall institute legal proceedings on the other hand to vindicate her right or right which she has quite independently under federal law, as well as under this local ordinance of Akron.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.429" offset="7925112">This is not an unimportant question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.195" offset="7944129">The availability of a local remedy even today when there is a federal remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1982.805" offset="8034617">I think there is no commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.357" offset="8040782">Certainly, by now they wouldn't be an active commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.386" offset="8060949">However, the Commission is to be appointed by the mayor of the city and I assume it could be brought back into existence without the delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.797" offset="8090520">I don't think it's a problem about reactivating a commission should this case return for a remedy in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.893" offset="8142973">There's been a lot of talk about local handling of local problems and of course everyone would agree that that's the most desirable, the most salutary way of handling this and other problems in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.939" offset="8215176">No federal law from Washington not even the federal courts sitting in the State of Ohio can afford the same affective relief as can a local commission administering its local ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.398" offset="8284975">It's an involvement of the local leaders as I've said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.913" offset="8298977">It's the local commitment of the inhabitants who have themselves passed the supplementary law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.895" offset="8322905">This is what the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1968 envisaged that they would be local laws, local remedies to supplement the federal right and of course that local commission is more readily accessible to those who were injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.001" offset="8415378">It's also important that the local communities not seem to be in conflict with the overriding federal law which of course applies in Akron as everywhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.574" offset="8481625">But the appearance of conflicts which results from Akron's having a charter provisions which says to its city council, you may pass no law providing for fair housing but the elimination of discrimination on the ground of race in housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.603" offset="8545782">When the federal law forbids such discrimination, it creates confusion, it seems to tell citizens of that city that whereas Washington that is telling them you may not discriminate, their own vetoes, their own electorate is condoning it and that I'm only saying that this makes it important and not moot.</text>

            <text syncTime="2316.874" offset="9370833">Perhaps I misunderstand but I thought he was presenting this on a following basis that here is in substance an overriding law which says that you can pass any kind to the City Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.236" offset="9444289">In Akron, you can pass any kind of housing legislation you want to by your ordinary processes but if it is housing legislation that relates to the problem of racial discrimination, you may not, you must first submit that to the voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.627" offset="9513880">It's my understanding of this argument that he says that that is a discrimination on racial grounds without a permissible object and that it therefore violates the Fourteenth Amendment perhaps specifically the Equal Protection Clause, is that your understanding of the argument?</text>

            <text syncTime="2389.276" offset="9660479">That argument would have no effect whatever as I see it on the validity of a specific referendum designed which has the effect of repealing a specific ordinance passed by the City Council of Akron.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.401" offset="9729024">I mean to say that that argument it seems to me to be inapplicable because the referendum machinery is available with respect to all ordinances but here your case is being presented to us in a very different basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.120" offset="9803839">That is to say the basis of singling out a particular kind of housing legislation namely, legislation directed to racial discrimination and saying as to that specific type of housing legislation, there must be not only, there must be a special procedure, i.e. submission to the voters.</text>

            <text syncTime="2450.963" offset="9907179">Perhaps I shouldn't take on the referendum case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.699" offset="9918151">I simply and to be candid in answer to your question didn't want to suggest that there were no arguments, no arguments available here which wouldn't have some bearing on that case as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.284" offset="9968515">If the referendum has the effect as a practical matter or as a legal matter as is claimed in this other case of disabling the council in the indefinite future from then enacting any such fair housing ordinance and the effect in so far as placing a burden on the victims of discrimination in obtaining an effective remedy through the political process is exactly the same whether it's done by a referendum disapproval of an existing ordinance or whether it's done as here by an amendment to the city charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.277" offset="10128488">It is debated in the other case whether the referendum has this effect and it does not appear that if the case of Akron, the referendum of disapproval of this ordinance by a timely referendum would have inhibited the ouncil from re-passing the ordinance at a later term, that is legally inhibited the council from re-passing the ordinance in the later term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.411" offset="10232978">But there is also the other difference which is that disapproval of an ordinance by referendum merely erases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.169" offset="10264012">It does not put into the organic law what seems to be what used on its face a discriminatory provision explicitly grounded on race and of course would resort to the referendum is available with respect to all ordinances, not quite all ordinances in the case of Akron.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.263" offset="10368397">Whereas here, we have a tailor made provision dealing with only the subject of fair housing which is a plain discrimination against the beneficiaries of such laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="2745.460" offset="11085197">Now, let me just emphasize the thrust of our argument here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.439" offset="11117171">It is that this amendment, the city charter has the undeniable affect of prejudicing the beneficiaries of this legislature of this type of legislation that is really not the main fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.855" offset="11182791">It also has the intended or unintended but nevertheless inevitable effect of encouraging or at least committing those who engage in this discrimination by assuring them that the likelihood of the passage of such an ordinance is more remote than it was before and that things will remain as they offer reasonably long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.759" offset="11298356">All of this might be beyond constitutional challenge if it resulted from the normal political process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.604" offset="11337749">Here, it results on the contrary from an action which narrows not enlarges the avenues of political relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.076" offset="11371708">We do have here a clogging of the political process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.636" offset="11385919">Normally, legislation can be passed either by the council or by the process of initiative or by combination of both through the submission to referendum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.412" offset="11428968">With respect to this one area, the council is not to be trusted especially since they demonstrated there our willingness to pass this fair housing legislation by two to three vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.894" offset="11482990">Therefore, the avenue of relief normally available through the elected representatives is no longer available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.405" offset="11516949">That has been shut off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.340" offset="11524681">The only way in which fair housing legislation can now be enacted accurately is through the cumbersome and quite unusual procedure of either initiative that's practical or theoretical a re-passage of this ordinance and an automatic referendum thereafter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2910.654" offset="11745991">We do think that singling out this particular matter indicates that this is not a feeling by the citizenry of Akron that it ought to resort to pure democracy but rather a tailor-made device which happens to work very well because those who were affected are minority and their voice will be more effectively ground out when the unabated rule of majority is allowed to prevail.</text>

            <text syncTime="2977.588" offset="12013693">It has but two choices: to combat discrimination or to remain scrupulously neutral with respect to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3022.459" offset="12193207">Our position here has three phases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.088" offset="12207731">I'm briefly going to touch on the subject of mootness, then I'm going to talk about where we stand with respect to Reitman and then I intend to talk some about the classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.567" offset="12265618">Now, with respect to mootness, it seems to me to start with and unless my friends on the other side here feel that the people of Akron will refuse to obey the state or the federal law that if that's their argument then perhaps we shouldn't be here at all but I don't think Akron are that kind of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.837" offset="12350673">They obey the state and federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.219" offset="12360286">Now, as to this particular specific complaint, both of the state and the federal law do cover it because if you will observe my appendix B in my brief, this is a complaint relating to the activities of a real estate agent and that is covered, that proposition is covered by both of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.896" offset="12474911">That was really the basic purpose in the sense as I see it for the state and federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.680" offset="12510124">And along that line, I begin to thinking a little bit about it and I look in the Sunday classification ads, just the Sunday before I came down here as to advertisements with respect to the sale and rental of real estate and I was amazed to find that of some close to 500 listings, 448 of them were listings by real estate people and only 15 or 20 were listings by individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.896" offset="12634990">In my own observation is that my travels through the City of Akron, I have yet to see a sign where like it used to be Alvin Vinopal wants to sell his house.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.846" offset="12678771">It's -- this is relates the regulation of a business, a vast business, namely the real estate business as well as the banking business in certain areas as I will come to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.575" offset="12721716">Now, the other aspect of the question of the mootness here is that Nellie Hunter anyway would hardly be involved in this complaint to find a house because she's now living in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.397" offset="12804995">And the other aspect about the fact that we have the state and the federal law as well as the Jones doctrine under the state and federal act, the ultimate complaint of a commission whatever may be ultimately ends up in the Common Pleas Court of the county where the individuals are located if they have the state law while the state can take over if they do or the city can take over.</text>

            <text syncTime="3265.648" offset="13166007">I noticed that it is seems the -- in these cases of this area that the courts have very little record come up here and there is a lot of assumptions are made about what was before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.977" offset="13215326">A -- another aspect of mootness is two that Akron is surrounded by what we would five or six bedroom communities which really have no law on the subject and these real estate people I suppose is, this Court certainly I would assume and I hope the Court would assume that these real estate dealers involved in a vast metropolitan area like that have office and in fact they do in just those separate communities and their activities relate to properties only in those communities and the Akron law wouldn't cover that subject at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.019" offset="13395466">Now, as a side issue to why I think that really the place for this type of law is with the state is again really real estate business, the activity of dealing and if you will observe the ordinance and even the state act, the ordinance, any person to whom an application is made for a financial assistance for the acquisition, construction, rehabilitation, repair, or maintenance of any housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.057" offset="13631613">Now, that certainly is a subject which is a regulatory matter involving real estate people and banking people and where real estate people and banking people are regulated by state law, I think that the state law is the place for this particular type of regulatory law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.388" offset="13716877">And that the state law does cover the activities of real estate agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.750" offset="13762330">And in fact, the matter I'm coming to now deal specifically with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.545" offset="13821576">I want to talk about the Reitman theory and the background in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.704" offset="13850206">Now, again Justice Fortas so that I want to be fair here in the record talking about background, I'm referring to a document which my adversaries have quoted on both of their briefs, discrimination on housing in Ohio and I'm sure the courts of the State of Ohio must have had this before them although there's nothing in any of the opinions relating to it but discrimination in Ohio subject got statewide by virtue of this report of the Civil Rights Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.124" offset="13995865">Now, that was in January of 1963 and then a bill was introduced by the month after that in 1963 and that bill died as the same goes in June of 1963 it was indefinitely postponed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.147" offset="14079979">But all along I feel to the -- and the environment was that the state was talking about fair housing discrimination in Ohio, so the next thing that happened we come along then to July of 1964 in Akron then passes the fair housing ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.184" offset="14164093">But prior to that, there was in the courts of the State of Ohio commencing in 1963 the case of Porter versus Oberlin which is cited in one of the briefs here wherein the City of Oberlin had a fair housing ordinance and it was attacked as being unconstitutional and in fact, the state court of Ohio did declare that particular ordinance to be unconstitutional, the enforcement portion of it stating that here was the attempt of a municipality to set up in the sense of court and that courts only could be created, particular municipal courts could only be created by the general legislator of the State of Ohio and that therefore since this commission was doing something in the nature of a judicial function that was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.958" offset="14387179">However, I do want to say though in fairness that when the matter came up in our case, the Akron case, the status of it was it was raised again and in the Akron case, the judge who wrote the opinion when our case was before them on the demur level said that the Akron officials had no standing to appeal that case and then several of the judges said that, well, in view of the fact that this Court and as was formally constituted held that the enforcement section of that fair housing ordinance was unconstitutional we would have to go along with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.945" offset="14571186">But now the consistency of the Court had changed and we probably wouldn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.683" offset="14594069">But the judgment in that Court only stood for the fact that the City of Akron's officials could not challenge the constitutional question.</text>
