            <text syncTime="39.634" offset="261935">Thank you Mr. Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.416" offset="273011">If it please the Court, this case arises under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.549" offset="305612">The case is here in writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to review that Court's interpretation of the Act's provisions governing the temporary landing of alien crewman for shore leave while their vessels call at United States ports.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.828" offset="378650">Before setting forth the facts of this case, I would like briefly to outline the statutory provisions which this case involves.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.606" offset="409788">In Parts IV and V of the Immigration and Nationality Act, Congress set out the basic provisions that establishing the procedures and the standards for the admission and expulsion of aliens into and from the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.508" offset="477393">In Part IV dealing with admissions, Congress provided that if an alien presenting himself at the Court of entry of the United States is denied admission by an immigration officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.445" offset="525145">The alien has a right to a hearing before a special inquiry officer or his admissibility and if he is stand to be inadmissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.392" offset="560985">He may appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals and from a finding in the Board that he is inadmissible, he may obtain judicial review by habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.872" offset="610826">Section 241 of the Act, sets out the grounds in which an alien may be expelled from the United States or deported and under 242 (b) of the Act, when it is alleged that an alien is deportable from the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.290" offset="680521">He has the right to a hearing before a special inquiry officer in which he may be represented by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.791" offset="706539">They present evidence and has the right to cross-examine witnesses against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.455" offset="753142">Sections 242 and 243 and the following Sections also provide for certain forms of discretionary relief from expulsion or deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.274" offset="796505">What are these forms of discretionary relief is under Section 243 (h) of the Act which authorizes the Attorney General in his discretion to withhold the deportation of any alien to any country in which his opinion, the alien may be subjected to persecution of an grounds of race, religion, or political opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.087" offset="883754">Under the regulations issued by the Attorney General that determination under Section 243 (h) is initially made by the special inquiry officer who conducts the deportation of proceeding under Section 242.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.938" offset="947075">In Part VI of the Immigration and Nationality Act, Congress establish special procedures for the admission and in some cases for the expulsion of alien crewman.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.914" offset="999006">Under Section 242 (a) of the Act which is the exclusive procedure for the temporary admission of alien crewman, Congress provided that an immigration officer may in his discretion issue a temporary permit for the alien crewman to land.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.719" offset="1082284">If he finds that the alien is a bona fide crewman and if he finds under subsection (a) (1) of 252 that the alien intends to depart on the vessel in which he arrives, and the permit issued under subsection (a) (1) is good for the period during which the alien crewman's vessel is in port.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.755" offset="1174444">The Section further provides that the alien crewman must agree to accept such a permit which is conditioned upon his being deported from the United States as provided in subsection (b) of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.923" offset="1223032">That Section, subsection (b) provides that if an immigration officer determines that the alien no longer intends to depart on the vessel on which he arrived.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.306" offset="1264619">The alien -- the immigration officer may take out and revoke the permit, take the crewman into custody and if practicable remove him to the vessel in which he arrived from removal from the United States on board that vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.471" offset="1317282">The Act provides it the alien whom and shall be deported from the United States, the expense of the transportation line which brought him.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.934" offset="1351137">The last section of Section 252 (b) is particularly important in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.756" offset="1370363">It provides that nothing in this Section shall be construed to require the procedure prescribed in Section 242 of the Act, the hearing before a special inquiry officer to cases falling within the provisions of this subsection Section 252 (a) in the set out on page 41 and 42 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.848" offset="1450715">Regulations issued by the Attorney General dealing with alien crewman also provide for a -- the parole of an alien crewman who alleges that he may be persecuted if he is returned to his homeland.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.604" offset="1517798">Thus, reflecting the discretionary relief available under Section 243 (h) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.891" offset="1542980">Now in this case, respondent, a native and citizen of Yugoslavia arrived in this country shortly before Christmas in 1964 as a member of a crew, the radio officer of a Yugoslavian vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.434" offset="1601076">He was issued to conditional landing permit under Section 252 (a) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.312" offset="1624586">Good for the time that his vessel would remain in the port in Oregon and on condition that respondent leave the United States with his ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.062" offset="1675577">He went ashore in January 4, 1965 and he went directly to the home of a cousin in the company of another crewman on board that ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.394" offset="1716955">And a day later they both returned to the immigration office in Portland, Oregon I believe and claimed that they've claim this -- sought asylum in the United States on the grant that they would be persecuted if they were return to Yugoslavia.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.584" offset="1801697">When representations which respondent made to the immigration officer at that time that he would not under any circumstances return to his ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.605" offset="1833775">His conditional landing permit was revoked and he was detained at the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.535" offset="1853524">On the following day the District Director gave respondent an opportunity to present a statement and evidence in support of his claim that he would be persecuted if he were return to Yugoslavia.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.325" offset="1900648">This was under the regulation which is set out its Regulation 253.1 (f) now and it is set out on page 46 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.485" offset="1949341">Upon advice of counsel, respondent refuse to give any evidence or make any statement in support of his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.618" offset="1977866">He contended that he had a right to a hearing before a special inquiry officer under 242 (b) on his claim of anticipated persecution under 243 (h) and he said that he wouldn't give any evidence to the District Director at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.646" offset="2049964">Consequently, the District Director without any evidence in support of the claim denied the application for parole and ordered that the respondent be removed to a ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.240" offset="2092283">Respondent then brought suit in the District Court and bargained to enjoin the District Director from removing him to his ship.</text>

            <text syncTime="761.335" offset="3148675">To continue on with the facts, after the District Director denied his claim for parole, he sued to enjoin the District Director from removing him to his ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.439" offset="3193083">The District Court and claim to that time also that he had to write to a hearing before a special inquiry officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.505" offset="3221400">The District Court denied his claim that he had a right to a hearing before a special inquiry officer but remanded the case back to the District Director for the taking of evidence, an opportunity which respondent accepted at this time and presented his evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.432" offset="3285138">When the evidence presented, the District Director found that there was insufficient, the showing of a sufficient likelihood of the persecution to justify granting the parole of the discretionary relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.659" offset="3341981">And ordered -- and denied the application again.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.566" offset="3361625">On review, the District Court found that the District Director's determination was not an abuse of discretion and agreed with the District Director that there had been a showing made of any sufficient likelihood of persecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.788" offset="3426513">Respondent did not appeal that determination by the District Court instead he sought relief by private bill in Congress when that bill was adversely acted upon in the following year in 1966, he again petition for parole for withholding a deportation administratively.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.297" offset="3512508">Again, claiming a hearing under Section 242, that relief was denied by the District Director on the ground that the prior proceeding was a fully adequate hearing and that the determination had been made adversely to respond.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.157" offset="3580008">He sued again in the District Court to enjoin the District Director from deporting him.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.313" offset="3604668">The District Court found that the prior proceedings were fully adequate, denied the relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.493" offset="3645315">On appeal of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the Court held that in view of the fact that respondent's ship had sailed during the pendency of the administrative proceedings on his claim of anticipated persecution that the revocation of the condition of landing permit under Section 252 (b) was no longer proper basis for the deportation of respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.214" offset="3756178">The Court held that unless in effect that unless the res -- that the alien crewman is in fact removed on his ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.348" offset="3792750">The revocation or the expulsion proceedings under Section 252 plus the board and the alien crewman is entitled in all matters with respect to the revocation and in all matters of discretionary relief to a hearing under Section 242 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="939.573" offset="3861713">We disagree with the holding of the District -- the holding of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.955" offset="3883238">We believe that so long as the alien crewman's conditional landing permit is revoke during the time that is in effect, that is during the time with the alien ship is still in port, that it presents a fully adequate basis for removal of the crewman from the United States at determination of any administrative or judicial proceedings that he might invoke on the question of his deportability or the question of any discretionary relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.912" offset="4002983">And Mr. Justice Brennan asked the question earlier, what was the basis of his prior claim that he had a right to a hearing under Section 242 (b)?</text>
            <text syncTime="984.406" offset="4041017">We really don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.094" offset="4047705">We assume that by the respondent's position in this Court in defending the judgment of Court of Appeals is that he has the right to a hearing before a special inquiry officer under 242 (b) because that's the way such claims are handled in regular 242 (b) proceedings which the Court of Appeals held he now has a right too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.060" offset="4151568">I have been unable to find any basis upon which it could be inferred merely from Section 243 (h) itself that it is a right to a hearing before a special inquiry officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.954" offset="4195140">It would seem that the Court of Appeals took the only statutory approach that can be made in this case and that is to find the right to a hearing before a special inquiry officer, in the right to a hearing before a special inquiry officer on all claims and all grounds of deportation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.850" offset="4298794">We begin our consideration of the statutory issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.859" offset="4314781">He responded also raise his constitutional claim, the statutory issue with the hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.217" offset="4340276">Suppose an alien crewman is issued a conditional landing permit under Section 252 (a), good for the time that his ship is to remain in port.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.567" offset="4373608">Immediately leaves his ship and goes several hundred miles inland where he obtains employment and a training program of a manufacturing plant and enters into a long term lease, a year's lease on an apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.588" offset="4429720">During the time that his ship is still in port, he is found by an immigration officer and on the evidence of his conduct his landing permit is revoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.555" offset="4469635">He is brought back to the port city and without objection placed to aboard his ship which sails the next day for foreign port.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.740" offset="4502340">Now, as our search reveals that all courts which have considered the question of interpreting Section 252 (a) and (d) including the Court below in the instant case would agree that the immigration officer in that case acted properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.268" offset="4580394">But the difficulty is of course, that in the hypothetical which we presented, the alien's voluntary departure from this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.773" offset="4614457">Well, voluntary in the sense that uncontested departure moots any challenge to the conduct of the immigration officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.631" offset="4657925">Now, we don't believe that Congress enact its Section 252 merely to provide a basis for or direction for conduct by an immigration officer in a situation that it couldn't be challenge in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.207" offset="4712155">We believe that Congress envision that alien crewman would exercise their rights for admini -- for judicial review certainly of the conduct of immigration officers under the statute and Congress presumably recognized that in those case, it is unlikely to be alien's ship would wait for him until the expiration -- until the judicial proceedings were terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.775" offset="4806510">The respondent adopts the reasoning of the Court of Appeals that approaches the problem from the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.235" offset="4828348">They say -- the respondent says, well, the Section 252 (b) procedure did not apply to the case where an alien crewman is jumps -- where an alien jumps his ship and enters the United States without a permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.039" offset="4895535">Under the case where he gets a permit to ship out in another ship, where a case in which his permit is not revoked while his ship is still in port but he stays on longer than that and they say it, well, since the statute is thus narrowly designed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.346" offset="4956766">It ought to be construed more strictly to apply only in the case where the alien is in fact deported on his ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.802" offset="4990621">Now, we disagree with that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.101" offset="4999816">We admit that from the face of the statute, Congress apparently contemplated that the alien crewman ship would be one of, if not the primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.230" offset="5040253">It means, for removing him from the United States but if Congress had wanted that to be the sole basis, the sole means for removing him from the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.270" offset="5080482">If Congress wanted to limit the statute only the situations, and where the alien is in fact removed on a ship, it could have done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.654" offset="5117994">We believe that it begs the question in this case, to say as the Court of Appeals did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.237" offset="5140355">That the necessity -- the justification for proper removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.887" offset="5162924">The justification for quick resolution departs with the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.014" offset="5179434">That assumes the Congress contemplated only that alien crewman would be deported on their ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.625" offset="5201899">We don't believe that that was a contemplation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.751" offset="5214333">They determined when the basis -- the Congress determined on the basis of evidence that there was a severe problem of alien crewman deserting their ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.183" offset="5252054">That it -- there would be a special class of alien crewman who would be granted conditional landing permits only on their agreement to depart with their ship and then if they fail to that agreement during the time their ships were still in port, they were immediately deportable whether on their ships, whether on another ship with the same line or whether after the determination of any administrative or judicial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.544" offset="5369501">Now a question has been raised, well -- could Congress rationally have made this determination?</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.823" offset="5394683">When it exempted from such procedures the crewman who jumped their ships or crewmen who were admitted to ship out in another vessel, although, the legislative history doesn't provide any guidance on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.853" offset="5462810">We believe that Congress rationally would have made such a determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.347" offset="5488724">The alien crewman who jumps his ship and enters without a permit at all, where the alien crewman who overstays his conditional landing permit without it being revoked may be found 10 days, 3 months, or 10 years later, and the 10 years later issue is one that I think that provides a basis for distinction between the two cases because unlike an alien who may have been in this country for 10 years, albeit illegally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.826" offset="5610663">And it established family relationships and other relationships which presents some equities in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.662" offset="5634069">The alien crewman whose conditional landing permit is revoked under Section 252 (b) has been here at the most for less than 29 days, at the most for the time that the ship has been in ports.</text>

            <text syncTime="1480.891" offset="6026951">I think that both of these -- both claims can be comprise to do a single federal due process claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.811" offset="6050565">The protocol incorporates by a reference, certain provisions of an international convention on the same subject and respondent in amicus cite certain provisions of that convention which relate to the expulsion of refugees on the assumption that respondent is a refugee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.193" offset="6140113">But the accepted international construction of the convention as the state department advised the Senate when it was considering the protocol.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.508" offset="6173445">Is that each of the contracting states reserves the right to interpret the convention to make the determination whether an individual is a refugee and in this case after a hearing in which he was entitled to present which he did present evidence and was represented by counsel, the District Director found that the respondent was not a refugee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.932" offset="6259127">Now, on respondent's federal due process claim, we note first that respondent is not here and has not as far as we know at any time during these proceedings challenge the revocation of this conditional landing permit has been anything other than a fully adequate constitutional basis for his removal from the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.035" offset="6351496">Nor does he challenge -- nor does he contend that the revocation of his conditional landing permit was arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.424" offset="6377096">It hardly can be contended in light of his representations to the immigration officer that it was arbitrary in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1605.808" offset="6526621">As I said before, he was given a hearing before a -- the Deputy District Director of the Immigration Service in which he was represented by counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1631.431" offset="6629125">So the only difference between the procedure which respondent received in this case and the procedure which he would have receive under Section 242 (b) under a 243 (h) claim is that the determination was made by the District Director rather than the special inquiry officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.051" offset="6707597">So the question is in the case of an admittedly deportable alien seeking discretionary relief from the ground of anticipated persecution whether it is consistent with due process, to have that discretion exercise by the District Director rather than the special inquiry officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.557" offset="6773635">And we do not believe that in the circumstances of this case fundamental fairness required that in the case in which all other contentions where to be adjudicated by the District Director that it was necessary constitutionally to some and special inquiry officer to determine this claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.902" offset="6843016">I'd like to reserve what time is remaining for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1693.369" offset="6876871">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.448" offset="6897142">My name is Bernhard Fedde from Portland, Oregon and this story -- this case is a story of a seaman who is trying to comply with the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.657" offset="6946043">He is not a deserting seaman trying to evade the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.098" offset="6959731">I think that makes a major difference in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.010" offset="6979375">The question which I believe is before this Court is whether an alien merchant seaman who enters this country on a D-1 landing permit is entitled to an impartial hearing before an independent and impartial administrative judge on his bona fide claim of right to stay here to escape prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.728" offset="7082297">Now, as I originally phrase this question, I insert the words after his ship sails.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.852" offset="7110823">I'm not sure now after reading the brief of Mr. Ennis' amicus in the -- of the American Civil Liberties of Union whether I need to insert that any longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.237" offset="7152306">In light of the treaty which provides -- which protects refugees and deserting seaman, all the deserting seaman chapter applies only in that treaty or protocol applies only to seaman, foreign seaman flying in our case under the American flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.590" offset="7229733">I believe therefore the question really boils down to this and our theory is that a seaman with a bona fide claim of right is entitle to a plenary hearing with full right of appeal under Section 242 in light of the new treaty and to the Constitution and laws and cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.905" offset="7311026">That's our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.317" offset="7316668">I'd like to state briefly and enlarge upon a statement of facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1813.382" offset="7356897">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.167" offset="7360031">It was on the ground that he had, I believe it was the question of statutory interpretation after the ship had sailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.568" offset="7385631">I believe that was the narrower question which was presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.909" offset="7411022">I believe that as I have stated it's a broader question Mr. Chief Justice and that the -- this would -- I have stated now, it may not be necessary for my case but I believe that is necessary for the Court each case which is the one which Mr. Ennis in the amicus brief is supporting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.932" offset="7503078">But I believe that as stated now it would be adequate to cover both and I have grown to this conclusion as I have been pondering the statute and the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.345" offset="7556786">Now first of all, the Government has pointed as argued that we had not protested the revocation of the landing permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.809" offset="7602657">The facts are that Stanisic with a valid landing permit on January 6, 1965 sought out the immigration service and presented to the immigration service a claim of asylum before his expi -- before his landing permit had been revoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.369" offset="7700877">There was -- he was making at and he had 10 days to go really as far as it turned out, as far as the ship was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.547" offset="7725537">The ship was around for another 10 or more days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.080" offset="7743718">He sought asylum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.351" offset="7752808">Did he have reason?</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.667" offset="7758033">Yes, 30 out 45 members of his family which was a Chetnik Yugoslav family have been executed or killed in the course of World War II and the war immediately following.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.794" offset="7814562">His own father, who was an orthodox priest's assistant, had been deprived of his church function and had been deprived of his pension rights, and was living a borderline starvation life in Yugoslavia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.508" offset="7881435">The -- he himself Stanisic in 1957, had tried to escape from Yugoslavia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.256" offset="7908394">He was caught by some fisherman just outside the (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.450" offset="7921142">He was brought back and then was threatened with life imprisonment by a court man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.653" offset="7949981">Now, this doesn't comport with my idea of fairness and due process when the court in advance of the next defense announces what he's going to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.795" offset="7990523">They said, “You're going to have life imprisonment the next time you appear before this court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.833" offset="8006719">This is why this -- in my opinion is a serious case of a claim of bona fide right of asylum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.629" offset="8041932">I think this makes every difference in the world.</text>

            <text syncTime="2437.263" offset="9852426">It -- on that -- in that deposition, it appears that there was no basis and fact whatever for this finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.365" offset="9884818">In other words, they took judicial notice of nothing and yet came up with the offset of what Stanisic had been able to show at that hearing on January 25 and 26.</text>

            <text syncTime="2479.338" offset="10020760">The District Director found no physical persecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.681" offset="10038105">I underscore the word “physical” here which are of course the exact language of 243 (h).</text>

            <text syncTime="2505.522" offset="10125458">Well, Stanisic then asked the Court to review because of the bias and prejudice of the District Director.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.828" offset="10150640">The District Court, Judge East refused to change the order of the District Director and then the matter died at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.713" offset="10194213">Mr. Stanisic and his companion Vucinic applied for a private bill in Congress and it failed June 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.672" offset="10238098">Then at that point, the District Director ordered Stanisic deported under and also Vucinic deported and gave them 70 hours notice to present themselves to the District Director for deportation to Yugoslavia, and as I understand they were to be sent there in handcuffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.355" offset="10328795">The -- in the meantime however, Section 243 (h) of the statute had been changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.988" offset="10371323">In other words, the goalpost had been moved. No longer was it physical persecution now it was persecution on account of race, religion, or political opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.386" offset="10404968">It had been broadened and we claimed that therefore the goalpost had been widened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.800" offset="10422523">And we therefore had a greater right than we had under question of physical persecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.642" offset="10449899">The District Director in the earlier proceedings used always the word physical persecution and we claim that the persecution that we were facing was persecution by reason of religion, orthodox, and political opinion namely Chetnik sympathies, anti-Yugoslav, and Government views.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.810" offset="10546657">And whether physical persecution would result is hard to say, although, we have in our brief pointed out some 10 different grounds upon which this man could face anything and it's a very vague position that he faces if he goes back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.726" offset="10610291">If he sent back he could face anything up to the death sentence back there and he has been promised a life imprisonment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3473.598" offset="13997746">The history of this is set forth rather neatly in the brief of the amicus and particularly, well beginning with page 5 and following on the brief of Mr. Ennis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.611" offset="14065768">The gist of the argument is that 253 is a regulatory or Immigration Service Clause and is not required by the statute, and under 243 (h) as Government counsel have indicated there is no procedures set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.668" offset="14142046">We claim that 242 proceedings apply namely a special inquiry officer hearing and for that reason they -- the regulatory that is the regulations 253 hearing should be stricken.</text>

            <text syncTime="3553.654" offset="14318007">As far as -- now, over the last 10 years, there have been only 276 Yugoslav seamen involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.249" offset="14352384">I pick up Yugoslav seamen because they are the primary ones from refugee countries that is -- countries where they might persecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="3672.309" offset="14792600">Mr. Chief Justice, the Chief Justice was very kind in extending the Government's time in which improvidently was terminated its opening statement because there's a matters of some importance, some very great importance in this case in which the Government and the respondent strongly disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.786" offset="14862503">The first place the respondent has -- respondent's counsel has painted the picture of an individual who in good conscience after coming ashore rather than trying to fade into the population presents himself in the immigration office to claim the asylum under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.571" offset="14937631">I would like to call -- to invite the Court's attention to respondent's testimony before the Deputy District Director on remand from the District Court to pages 12, 14, 20 to 22, 29, and 30 of his testimony which is in the record in the Court filed in the little manila folder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.567" offset="15045674">It is not printed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.097" offset="15051734">It is the Government's position that that testimony gives persuasive evidence that respondent entertained the idea and the intention well before he came into Oregon this time to desert his ship and to remain permanently in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.338" offset="15124773">At the time that he came to Oregon, he obtained the conditional landing permit from an immigration officer on his agreement to return with his ship, in his representation to the immigration officer that he was going to return with ship and then he was not going to desert a ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.502" offset="15185377">I think the best thing that you can say on the basis of this evidence is that the position that respondent finds himself now is to scheme that was initially conceived in this representation.</text>
