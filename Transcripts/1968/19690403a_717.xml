            <text syncTime="100.707" offset="508280">Following -- following this event.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.549" offset="531581">Now turning to Number 717, the Radio Television and News Directors Association case which there are a considerable number of other respondents, a number of whom have filed briefs, I think I might say at this point that I take at certain satisfaction from the fact that in this case, the American Civil Liberties Union is on my side and also the United Church of Christ has filed a brief amicus curiae which is a very excellent brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.592" offset="703781">If the court should find our brief too long, I would hope they would read that because it is a very fine presentation of our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.633" offset="751950">This case is the sequel to the one just argued but it's quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.318" offset="778700">It fits in chronologically but it comes with a very different setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.629" offset="811928">There are no facts in this case but there is a formal regulation which is attacked with a widely scattering shotgun.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.231" offset="870337">The Federal Communications Commission wrote its final Red Lion Letter on December 10, 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.603" offset="911820">Shortly thereafter, on April 6, 1966, the Commission issued a notice of proposed rulemaking complying fully with all of the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.820" offset="980679">This indicated the Commission's purpose to adopt rules with respect to two matters, personal attacks and political editorials.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.509" offset="1019444">The text to the proposed rule was set forth and in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act comments were invited and many were received.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.922" offset="1061136">And the comments however took the form of arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.251" offset="1078376">There were some reputations or some representations but nothing in the form of evidence was presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.977" offset="1109305">There were no affidavits or depositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.002" offset="1125397">Nor was any testimony of witnesses offered or invited at the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.317" offset="1142638">That isn't the practice with respect to hearings on a proposed rulemaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.104" offset="1173880">More than a year later, on July 5, 1967 and in that connection with respect to findings, I would like to call attention to Justice Brandeis in Pacific States Company against White.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.361" offset="1242843">There is a lot of talk in this case to the effect that the Commission didn't make findings to support its regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.222" offset="1270324">But Justice Brandeis in that well-known case said here, "There is added reason for applying the presumption of validity for the regulation now challenged was adapted after notice and public hearing as the statute required.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.892" offset="1328943">It is contended that the order is void because the administrative body made no special findings of fact but the statute did not require special findings doubtless because the regulation authorized with general legislation, not an administrative order and the nature of a judgment directed against an individual concern.‚Äù</text>
            <text syncTime="330.257" offset="1426432">In 1967, the Commission formally adopted the rules which had had proposed with only slight changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.636" offset="1459973">In doing so, the Commission issued a statement saying that it was simply a codification intended to clarify a portion of the obligation under the Fairness Doctrine which as I have indicated in the previous case finds its origin more than 40 years ago and has been slowly developing over all of the intervening years with the Equal Time Provision and the statute going back to 1927 as the first exemplification of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.524" offset="1607513">We think it finds specific statutory recognition in the amendment which Congress adopted to Section 315 in 1959 as well as in Section 315 itself which is the Equal Time Provision which after all is simply a specification of one application of the general fairness concept which is implicit in the very fact of Federal Regulation of Radio Communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.021" offset="1745544">The regulation which the Commission adopted in 1967 has been twice amended at both times to narrow it, both times I think an exercise of care and caution by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.050" offset="1813671">On August 7, 1967, it was amended to exempt bona fide newscast and on the spot coverage of bona fide news events and then after review was sought in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.813" offset="1872708">It was amended again, this time to exempt bona fide news interviews and commentary or analysis in the course of bona fide newscast.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.251" offset="1922445">The regulation as finally amended is set out on pages 7 and 8, the very last line on page 6 but on page 7 and 8, of the Government's brief and I think it is desirable to put its term before the Court by reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.567" offset="2007709">It starts with the heading personal attacks, political editorials.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.040" offset="2029547">When during the presentation of views on a controversial issue of public importance and attack is made upon the honesty, character, integrity, or like personal qualities of an identified person or group, the licensee shall within a reasonable time and in no event later than one week after the attack transmit to the person or group attacked; (1) notification of the date and time and identification of the broadcast; (2) a script or tape or an accurate summary of this or if a script or tape is not available of the attack; and (3) an offer of a reasonable opportunity to respond over licensees facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.747" offset="2212404">(b) The provision of this paragraph (a) -- of paragraph (a) of this station shall not be applicable; (1) to attacks on foreign groups or foreign public figures; (2) to personal attacks which are made by legally qualified candidates, their authorized spokesman or those associated with them in the campaign on other such candidates, their authorized spokesman or persons associated with the candidates in the campaign and (3) to bona fide newscasts, bona fide news interviews and on the spot coverage of a bona fide news event including commentary or analysis contained in the foregoing programs but the provisions of paragraph (a) shall be applicable to editorials of the licensee.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.702" offset="2424205">And then there is a note, the Fairness Doctrine is applicable to situations coming within three above and then a specific factual situation may be applicable in the general area of political broadcast.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.862" offset="2484914">And then paragraph (c) where -- paragraph (c) turns to a new topic, a personal attack is close now.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.291" offset="2518559">This is the editorializing portion of the regulation where a licensee, in an editorial, (i) endorses or (ii) opposes a legally qualified candidate or candidates, the licensee shall, within 24 hours after the editorial, transmit to respectively (i) the other qualified candidate or candidates for the same office or (ii) the candidate opposed in the editorial (1) notification of the date and the time of the editorial; (2) a script or tape of the editorial; and (3) an offer of a reasonable opportunity for a candidate or a spokesman of the candidate to respond over the licensee's facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.852" offset="2680832">Provided, however, that where such editorials are broadcast within 72 hours prior to the day of the election, the licensee shall comply with the provisions of this subsection sufficiently far in advance of the broadcast to enable the candidate or candidates to have a reasonable opportunity to prepare a response and to present it in a timely fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.342" offset="2774768">Now, I think that that shows that the Commission used a great care in formulating the regulation and making its requirements clear to the broadcasters who are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.946" offset="2833178">Before I leave the question of the text to the regulations, I should refer to one other matter when the final amendment of the regulation was issued there was also an accompanying memorandum and this is set out at page 228 of Volume 1 on the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.893" offset="2937041">Both the Radio News -- Radio Television News Directors Association, I never can keep those initials straight RTNDA, and the Columbia Broadcasting System make much in their briefs, subparagraph 5 of this memorandum which is set out beginning on page 232 and it is repeatedly said in particularly in the Columbia Broadcasting brief that though the Commission in its regulation exempted those several categories of news broadcast, bona fide newscast, bona fide news interviews, and on the spot coverage of a bona fide news event including commentary or analysis contained in the foregoing programs that they took it all back by paragraph 5 of this memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.583" offset="3183741">And I suggest without reading paragraph 5 now, that what paragraph 5 does is simply to remind the stations that everything they do is subject to the Fairness Doctrine and even though these items in the news programs are exempted that if overall they have done a job which is not in the public interest, that is a matter which is relevant in consideration with the regulation of the stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.705" offset="3340267">We think that the suggestion in the Columbia Broadcasting brief that this takes back everything is not an accurate summary of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.456" offset="3395229">All that paragraph 5 does is to say that the news programs like everything else the broadcaster does remains subject to the Fairness Doctrine which is inherent in the very concept of public regulation of broadcasting and is implicit in the grant of a temporary license to a broadcaster on the basis of public convenience, interest and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.856" offset="3516855">So we have the rules which were adopted by the Commission in 1967 with the two later modifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.812" offset="3556665">Without anything more, the respondents here filed petitions for review of the orders of the Commission, some of these were filed in the Seventh Circuit, others in the Second but they were all consolidated by transfer in the Seventh Circuit and that is the one decision which is before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.848" offset="3648825">For a record, the parties filed the comments which have been filed before the Commission and the orders and memoranda of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.952" offset="3693234">There is a second volume of the appendix, appendix Volume 2 which counsel on the other side assures is a part of the record but I wonder.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.412" offset="3747046">It is at least an odd sort of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.711" offset="3764287">It consists of factual material not otherwise in the record which was included in the brief which was filed before the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.838" offset="3812770">There was a motion for leave to file this brief as an exhibit and this motion was granted by a judge of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.353" offset="3846834">I don't suppose that makes it a part of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.704" offset="3860208">And then there was insistence that we include it in the record here and we did not think it worth making an issue of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.491" offset="3895421">Whatever this material is, I would point out that it was never submitted to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.735" offset="3920394">The Commission did not have the benefit of whatever value it may have.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.716" offset="3940248">In any event, almost without exception, it is irrelevant here for the several broadcast recounted would all or nearly all be accepted from the personal attack rules by the exceptions which the Commission has included in those rules in an effort to be sure that the burden on broadcasters and the spontaneity of their handling of news programs and commentary should be as great as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.751" offset="4060411">And I would mention too that the footnotes in the several briefs contain references to program which have appeared since the rules were promulgated and with no indication that the rules are applicable to this or that anyone is seeking to apply the rules to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.319" offset="4150690">Now, the whole proceeding puzzles me, no one has yet been ordered to do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.296" offset="4178589">No penalties or forfeitures have been imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.814" offset="4188724">There are no specific concrete facts before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.366" offset="4206905">The facts just float around and this morning about five minutes before the argument, I was handed a transcript of a broadcast of January 28, 1969 and told that it would be referred to in the argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="1737.132" offset="7053939">We get considerable comfort from portions of this Court's decisions in Nelson Brothers, University of Georgia, Pottsville Broadcasting and particularly National Broadcasting Company against the United States and this are set out on pages 42 and 44 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.756" offset="7144427">The other side finds comfort in Mills against Alabama and Near against Minnesota.</text>

            <text syncTime="1770.316" offset="7186641">I've already tried to argue that it does not follow that broadcast regulation is exactly the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.879" offset="7216943">Mills involved absolute restraint on publication said, "You can't print it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1785.712" offset="7248290">And Near involved restraint in substance and a large measure of control over future publication in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.514" offset="7279428">But I would particularly rely on the fact that both cases involved newspapers and did not involved any aspect of the development of the consequences of the Fairness Doctrine which is inherent and implicit in a medium which uses a public facility and is licensed to do so under standards of public interest, convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.441" offset="7387157">It's true that the broadcasters are not a public utility and Congress made that decision and I think rightly in 1927.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.532" offset="7423519">But they are a public facility and needn't have public protection and they have responsibilities arising from those facts which are not shared by newspapers or others who communicate through print.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.924" offset="7493110">The Columbia Broadcasting System in their brief say that the Fairness Doctrine is not involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.807" offset="7528636">But we think it lies behind the whole problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.764" offset="7544519">It is an aspect of the fact that the broadcaster must serve the public interest if he is to have and retain a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.873" offset="7588927">Let us suppose for example a station which obtains a license and simply does not operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.970" offset="7621319">Surely, its license will be revoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.956" offset="7637201">Does that violate the First Amendment?</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.519" offset="7651516">Isn't there a freedom not to speak as well as a freedom to speak?</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.257" offset="7674399">Not I venture to think if you are a radio or television licensee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.122" offset="7701880">Or suppose that a station decides that it will broadcast only obscenity or only readings from books such as Fanny Hill which have been held to be protected in print by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.901" offset="7757051">Would such a station serve the public interest within the Federal Communication's Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.203" offset="7786203">And would it violate the First Amendment to say that it did not and to revoke its license?</text>

            <text syncTime="1933.871" offset="7840956">It may be said that this illustrations deal with the public interest but not with fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.714" offset="7872303">Let me move on then to such cases as the Office of Communication of the United Church of Christ against the Federal Communications Commission which was decided not long ago by the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia in a careful and thoughtful opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.481" offset="7951297">That case involved a television station in Jackson, Mississippi which it was alleged, discriminated in many ways against the nearly 50% of the persons in its listening area who are Negroes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2197.742" offset="8896408">AM radio stations can have a very wide range and with satellite communication and cable television and so on the television stations are not as clearly to be distinguished as they used to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.566" offset="8971640">The Government does not by this regulation support any point of view except of course the central idea of the First Amendment that there should be an opportunity for all points of view to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.003" offset="9037469">An important corollary of these regulations is that they strongly reduce the incentive for the Government to select its broadcast licensees in ways that might be difficult to detect on the basis of the political or other views that they are likely to expressed or favor in their broadcasting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.949" offset="9117194">Now, this too serves the policies of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.504" offset="9143421">An analogy may be found in arguments in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.172" offset="9162125">It has been my observation that when one counsel speaks, there is always an opportunity for one to speak on the other side and exactly the same amount of time made available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.616" offset="9219908">And if as happened in this case a counsel seek to have the case taken of the summary docket and put on the regular docket so that they may have an hour on the side then an hour is given to the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.518" offset="9287513">This might be regarded as inhibition upon his asking for additional time for himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.773" offset="9300470">An inhibition quite comparable to that complained of by our opponents in these cases except that it's the Court's time rather than the broadcaster's time which is being consumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.664" offset="9368074">But the inhibition is obviously justified on the basis of considerations of fairness and of values reflected in the First Amendment which favor an opportunity for both sides of controversies to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.933" offset="9433172">As I contended in the argument in the Red Lion case, our opponents in these cases seek to put us in opposition to the First Amendment and we do not accept that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.902" offset="9493044">I suggest that on analysis, it is the Government and the Federal Communications Commission which are the real champions of the First Amendment here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.242" offset="9534422">The Commission's regulation served to foster important First Amendment values which our opponents would have the Court sacrifice in the guise of upholding the narrow and financially motivated claim to unfettered control of airwaves that had been licensed to their custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.417" offset="9619059">This argument is I submit fully supported by this Court's recent decision in the Citizens Publishing Company case decided on March 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.993" offset="9697426">The Court there quoted from the Associated Press opinion in explaining the beneficial effects of free speech in the application of antitrust laws to the communications media and I was quite struck when this case came down with the closeness of the application of that quotation utilized by this Court only three weeks ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.811" offset="9804633">It would be strange indeed if the grave concern for freedom of the press which prompted adoption of the First Amendment should be read as a command that the Government was without power to protect that freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.317" offset="9866700">The First Amendment from providing an argument against application of the Sherman Act and here I would simply read it the personal attack rules, here provides powerful reasons to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.808" offset="9924692">That Amendment rest on the assumption that the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources is essential to the welfare of the public that a free press is a condition of a free society and there is more of the quotation very much of which is relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.082" offset="10017792">This view is also supported by the venerated conquering opinion of Mr. Justice Brandeis in Whitney against California which emphasizes the great reliance upon the value of counter argument that is implicit in our protection of free speech in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.769" offset="10112460">The realities of the broadcasting industry have led the Federal Communications Commission entirely properly in our view to take the steps needed in these regulations to make the opportunities for counter argument a reality in this important communications medium.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.264" offset="10218517">In the associated press case, the applicability of the antitrust laws to the new services and its members in no way depended on the content of their new stories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.526" offset="10271493">This was also true in the Citizens Publishing case this term to which I have just referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.171" offset="10302109">The restraints of trade in those cases would have been equally unlawful if all the editorials and new stories being published had taken the other point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.833" offset="10348711">The Court in those cases upheld the Government's right to regulate these news media in the interest of legitimate antitrust objectives in a context in which the regulation was entirely neutral with respect to the content of what was being published and in which no one was being forbidden from publishing anything while the application of the antitrust laws may have reduced profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.655" offset="10472009">This is also true of the application of the Fair Labor Standards Act or the Income Tax to newspapers and broadcasters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.431" offset="10515163">In this case, another communications medium is being regulated in pursuit of an equally valid government objective and in -- and again in a way that does not favor or disfavor any particular content of speech and which does not forbid the saying of anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.152" offset="10614011">The policies of the First Amendment not only favor access to the media of purveyors of all points of view but the Court has specifically recognized the First Amendment right in the recipient or listener not to have the channels of communication to him stay so as to favor or disfavor a particular point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.492" offset="10727382">This was established in the case of Lamont against the Postmaster General cited at page 75 of our brief in which I am inclined to think on reflection and preparing this argument is perhaps one of the most important cases which lead in support of our position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.119" offset="10813900">It's true that the Court has stricken down regulations in some cases which were superficially neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.081" offset="10845769">For example, the complete banning of methods of communication such as soundtracks or handbills tends to discriminate against those espousing unpopular ideas and who do not have easy access to the commercial communications media.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.568" offset="10923719">Similarly, requirements of associational disclosure can -- to bring about burdens on those associated with groups that are unpopular in the community and thus to discourage association with such groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.056" offset="10989652">Much the same can be said about Taley against California where the court upheld a right to anonymity in the dissemination of political literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.097" offset="11037821">There is also an important element of this in the New York Times against Sullivan line of cases because a large liable verdict tends to indicate that the plaintiff in his views are held in high esteem in the community and the contrary about the defendant while it is difficult for a truly unpopular plaintiff to win much of a liable verdict against the popular defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.266" offset="11146491">Yet the main office of the courts under the First Amendment is the right to -- is to protect the right to expressed views that are not already popular and accepted in the community and I suggest that that is the fundamental basis behind New York Times against Sullivan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.385" offset="11250981">Now, we come to the editorializing aspect of the rules which is discussed on pages 78 to 82 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.276" offset="11318481">Here again, I'm a little puzzled because the principal -- some of the principal briefs filed in the case are filed by the networks and the networks do not editorialize whether the Radio Television News Director Association engages in televising, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.126" offset="11413880">Here again, we have no facts, nothing to indicate that they do or do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.259" offset="11442406">But in essence the editorializing rules are much the same as the personal attack rules they called for opportunity to reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.717" offset="11512310">They are an exemplification of the Fairness Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.430" offset="11539163">They are a means of keeping open the channels of communication of facilitating the objective of the First Amendment which is to provide an opportunity for the public to hear and to learn.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="3211.635" offset="12951970">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.972" offset="12973286">At the outset of the -- my argument, there are three semantic differences, perhaps I should add a fourth now between the point of view expressed by the Solicitor General and the point of view that we submit to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.369" offset="13038905">The first is that this case involves the personal attack and political editorial rules and does not involve a general attack on the Fairness Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.677" offset="13100136">The rules are very precise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.972" offset="13113302">They provide that if a broadcaster expresses a particular kind of idea, if he criticizes a public official in a way that may be regarded as an attack upon his honesty, character, integrity, or like personal qualities whatever that may mean then certain obligations attached to it and we submit to the Court and I will try to show in more detail in my argument that those obligations attached to the expression of a particular idea or kind of idea, the one that is constitutionally protected, are much more onerous than any obligations imposed by the Fairness Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.773" offset="13300548">And I may say that this is true of those kinds of programs that are characterized as exempt under the regulation that the Commission has a special brand of the Fairness Doctrine and one that the Solicitor General in the statement the Solicitor General would have read if he had trouble to read paragraph 5 to the Court, that said, ‚ÄúUnlike the Fairness Doctrine in general, there are special obligations where there is something that can be characterized as a personal attack even in a news program.‚Äù</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.625" offset="13427921">Now, the second semantic difference goes to our reading of history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.220" offset="13446311">In fact the other two go to our reading of history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.848" offset="13460835">We agree that the -- there are certain expressions of regulation of the content of broadcast to be found in the Commission's administration of the Communications Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.658" offset="13512035">But I think when you come to read those carefully, you will find that they are expressed -- they are based upon a view of the First Amendment's application to broadcast which is simply out of keeping with modern interpretation of the constitutional doctrine of the First Amendment and out of keeping with the current facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.006" offset="13597403">The best example is the Mayflower Role which prohibited a broadcast journalist from taking an editorial position on anything, a position which surely would not be sustained by this Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.370" offset="13646932">Indeed, Judge Bazelon recently observed in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia that it may very well be that some vulnerable FCC policies cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny in the light of contemporary understanding of the First Amendment and the modern proliferation of broadcasting outfits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.415" offset="13735121">The third thing which I would mention now simply to draw the Court's attention and I shall develop it at more length later is that also the Congress and this Court have of course sustained certain regulation of broadcasting and although Congress has spoken in the broad terms public interest that the Solicitor General emphasizes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.271" offset="13838461">Both Congress and this Court have been very careful to distinguish between regulation that has to do with avoiding interference, securing competent licensees dealing with the structure of the industry as in the chain broadcasting cases on the one side and regulation that lays hold of what is said on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.523" offset="13939503">That's not always a clear line but I would emphasize that in the history, both sides of the line come through and not just the side mentioned by the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.256" offset="13982448">The clearest expression is by Congress itself for it declared in Section 326, ‚ÄúNothing in this Act shall be understood or construed to give the Commission the power censorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.518" offset="14031454">And no regulation or condition shall be promulgated by the Commission which will interfere with the right of free speech by broadcast communication.‚Äù</text>

            <text syncTime="3496.584" offset="14091745">I think -- I'm not sure whether that was in the Radio Act of 1927.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.415" offset="14107105">It certainly came in the Communications Act of 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.883" offset="14128943">This Court in the Sanders Brothers case noted the licensing power on the one hand but said that on the other hand, the Commission was given no control over progress and I would mention now too although I shall elaborate it and give you the language later that Congress on three occasions, the Congress on two and the President on one occasion, rejected in the legislative process attempts to put broadcasters subject to the duties essentially the same kind of duties that the Commission now seeks to impose in these regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.510" offset="14279408">My other semantic difference for the Solicitor General is of course one mentioned by Justice White and that is that nothing has come to be better settled than that regulations of speech are to be judged on their face by their tendency and that the Court will not require the nation to wait until a test case arises before it examines and if they are unconstitutional strikes down such regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.649" offset="14412006">And that proposition is so well settled that I don't stop to develop.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="3622.595" offset="14595803">I would think this was a question on which the Court would make up its own mind on that there was not presumption in favor of the FCC ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.218" offset="14634256">We have to persuade the Court to reach a different conclusion but I think there's no presumption in its favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.240" offset="14658393">Now, we submit that these regulations are invalid upon two primary grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.994" offset="14697368">First, we say that they unconstitutionally abridged the freedom of speech and press guaranteed by the First Amendment and second that they are invalid because they are beyond the statutory authority of the Communications Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.951" offset="14761211">I shall deal with the constitutional issue first even though the Court may never reach it or because it can and I'm inclined to think should decide the case on the statutory ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.883" offset="14816904">But I deal with it first because the seriousness of the constitutional question is in our judgment an important element in resolving the issue of statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.026" offset="14873537">Our constitutional argument proceeds in a series of propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.534" offset="14895585">The early ones of which seem to me to be not seriously controversial but first we say this case involves freedom of the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.788" offset="14944590">The electronic media are not simply carriers as they have evolved in this country and that may be one difference between what President Hoover was thinking of in 1924 and the situation as it exists today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3725.504" offset="15007389">Broadcasters' activities in the field of public affairs are virtually indistinguishable from those of newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.076" offset="15037691">They have editors, producers, reporters, their own news services which add to the new services of UPI and the AP.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.369" offset="15078860">Their functions I submit make them one of the very instruments which this Court characterized in Mills and Alabama as agencies which the framers of our Constitution thoughtfully and deliberately selected to improve our society and keep it free.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.531" offset="15151585">Second, I would point out that the challenge regulations lay hold of speech itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.316" offset="15186693">This is the fact which distinguishes every other case involving broadcasting that has come before this Court because they all had to do with the economic regulation of the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.423" offset="15235072">We're not talking about Fair Labor Standards and Labor Relations or the antitrust laws here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3788.434" offset="15259105">We're talking about a regulation which says as I indicated earlier that if you expressed ideas for certain character, ideas which can be described as an attack on somebody's integrity or honesty or other personal qualities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.587" offset="15327754">Or if you put someone on the air who may engage in those attacks, then you run the risk of having to carry certain obligations which are onerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3818.158" offset="15378014">But if you stir clear of those ideas, if you prefer blandness to biting criticism of the shabby yourself seeking then you're safe, then you don't have to worry and we think that this is fairly characterized as a regulation of speech itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.015" offset="15449485">Not only that, but of course the speech that this regulation lays hold of is the kind of speech which this Court characterized in the New York Times case as lying at the very center of the constitutionally protected area of free expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="3854.355" offset="15522837">By its own terms these regulation applies only when one is discussing questions of public importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3861.583" offset="15551781">The speech in the Red Lion case was certainly within the New York Times case and this is true under all the other Commission rulings under the Fairness Doctrine or the Personal Attack Rule which deal with criticisms of public officials for the most part or people engaged in controversy upon public issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3886.700" offset="15652195">My third proposition is that the challenge regulations abridge the freedom of speech in ways which unless justify violate the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.669" offset="15704127">Inhibition as well as prohibition of protected expression is forbidden by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3908.314" offset="15738713">That's perfectly clear from cases like Talley and California, Thomas and Collins, Lamont and Postmaster General.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.082" offset="15773717">Here, the Commission as I said before says you may not criticize in the way that we would call a personal attack unless you're prepared to scrutinize what has gone out over the air and see whether it contains any personal attacks.</text>

            <text syncTime="4170.037" offset="16785596">The financial cost of giving the risk that you must give time whenever you put a free swinging controversialist on the air is not inconsiderable and most of all there is the pressure for self-censorship which these things create.</text>
            <text syncTime="4191.492" offset="16871382">Now, I would like to take a few concrete illustrations to show how as we see it these regulations are bound to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="4205.887" offset="16928956">Let me call your attention first to a broadcast of Eric Sevareid which appears beginning on page 15 and runs over to page 16 of the record in the second volume, the one that the Solicitor General objects to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4222.011" offset="16993426">But we offer this simply as examples of how these regulations would work out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4227.182" offset="17014115">I could make up examples but it's more persuasive to use real ones and that's the reason they bring them into Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4234.418" offset="17043059">Mr. Sevareid gave what I think you would agree was an impartial and fair presentation of Henry Luce's contributions to American Journalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="4248.611" offset="17099901">Toward the end he said, it's on the bottom of page 16, he referred to Time and said the Time strained in every sentence to avoid dullness which often meant straining proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="4261.967" offset="17153296">Many journalists have always distrusted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4265.083" offset="17165730">Nearly all have always read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4267.746" offset="17176388">Now, I suppose that that is an attack on an unidentified group, the Time editors and it raises a question about their intellectual integrity and if it were directed at me, I would think that was an attack upon my personal character.</text>
            <text syncTime="4285.174" offset="17246083">At the time Eric Sevareid said this, he was not subject to any inhibitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4291.074" offset="17269697">But considering today if he were confronted with the same situation preparing his evening broadcast at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, what does he do?</text>
            <text syncTime="4303.440" offset="17319225">Is this a personal attack or isn't it?</text>
            <text syncTime="4306.884" offset="17332914">Well, he might answer that it is and then he subjects every station that carries this program to all these burdens.</text>
            <text syncTime="4317.017" offset="17373456">Should he do that or should he trim his sales a bit?</text>
            <text syncTime="4320.886" offset="17388920">Or maybe he doesn't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="4322.779" offset="17396548">So what, does he call up his lawyer?</text>
            <text syncTime="4326.086" offset="17409714">The result, all too often is likely today that Mr. Sevareid will decide, ‚ÄúWell I better not say just what I think.</text>

            <text syncTime="4779.515" offset="19223448">It's italicized, ‚ÄúWhether you advocate what Rap Brown and Stokely Carmichael have been advocating, Guerilla-type warfare in the cities of our country?‚Äù</text>
            <text syncTime="4790.615" offset="19267856">That would seem to be a personal attack by Mr. Dean on Stokely Carmichael and Rap Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="4799.407" offset="19303069">Now, of course both Rap Brown and Stokely Carmichael have ample access to the press.</text>

            <text syncTime="4809.482" offset="19343297">I don't think there is any question of fairness in getting their views before the public but nevertheless under these regulations, there would be a very real question of whether CBS did not have to go through all this machinery of giving them time for reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="4830.917" offset="19429083">Over on page 66, toward the bottom, you will see a reference to Representative Conyers of Detroit who was referred to as a Black Judas.</text>

            <text syncTime="4860.091" offset="19545799">Over on page 67, Mr. Powell says that Claude Pepper was one of the number racists on money sellers committee against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4871.811" offset="19592714">This again, I should suppose though I can't say without any assurance because the Government persists in ignoring these questions, I should suppose was a personal attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="4885.624" offset="19647885">If it's a personal attack as the Commission has ruled to say that the John Burke's Society attempted through a front organization to have a standard reference book removed from the library in Visalia, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="4901.687" offset="19712146">But then I would suppose this kind of thing was rather clearly a personal attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="4906.966" offset="19733253">And then there's a reference to Judge Matthew Levy for issuing an indecent, obscene, illegal, unilateral article.</text>
            <text syncTime="4916.736" offset="19772332">I would think that that too might well be a personal attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="4920.918" offset="19789051">Now the point I'm trying to make is that after this program which was a free live discussion, the work would begin, I'm going through it and going over these things, such questions as Justice Stewart raised as to whether it really was a personal attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="4942.824" offset="19876718">In many instances might have be taken into account, it might be decided that it wasn't Mr. Justice, I agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="4950.393" offset="19907020">But the thing is that nobody knows for sure and some of my colleagues think that there are many more personal attacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4958.102" offset="19937844">But there would be at least six or eight of them in that single ‚ÄúFace the Nation‚Äù program and all those instances in which the obligations would fall upon the network and all CBS stations to carry out the duty of offsetting its programming substituting offers of free time for reply and the replies in the place of what matters which in its editorial judgment it thought were more important.</text>

            <text syncTime="5437.341" offset="21854814">Now, there are two answers to the argument with the desire to provide fairness and balance in the case of the press is a justification for these regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="5460.682" offset="21948123">This is an argument which is advanced in its strongest form by the National Broadcasting Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="5468.560" offset="21979679">The National Broadcasting Company says the imposition by an arm of Government of its standard of fairness on the press and the enforcement of that obligation by governmentally imposed sanctions is contrary to the constitutional guarantee of freedom of the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="5488.214" offset="22058256">This is an argument of which might be put a little less absolutely and indeed in my brief I have put much the same argument a little less absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="5498.208" offset="22098275">As we assert that the basic postulate of the First Amendment is that the public interest in excess to a variety of ideas is to be secured by relying on the diversity and multiplicity of expression.</text>

            <text syncTime="5543.276" offset="22278520">I don't want to mislead you and indeed the logic of my argument that if you do this then you must do that puts in question to some extent of the Fairness Doctrine because that essentially is a part of the doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="5573.084" offset="22397743">The essence of it is the Government notions of fairness of impartiality are a violation of the First Amendment that if in some circumstances that may be conjured up.</text>

            <text syncTime="5597.180" offset="22494187">There is no such condition in the broadcasting industry today partly because of the proliferation of stations which are 10 times what they were on the early 1940s.</text>
            <text syncTime="5608.966" offset="22541312">Partly because broadcasting is only one of many media and indeed it adds to the access people otherwise would have two opinion and if I'm not going through it but if -- when you think about the Red Lion case, you noticed how the dialogue developed across media.</text>
            <text syncTime="5628.231" offset="22618321">It's a very good indication that this notion of the insulated listener that the Commission hypothesized is not realistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="5637.707" offset="22656251">Now, the argument that I just mentioned which I say I do refer Your Honors to our briefs is not made by CBS.</text>
            <text syncTime="5648.494" offset="22699405">CBS' position which all of us joined except that we make the other argument too, emphasizes the peculiarly restrictive character of the challenged regulation and it asserts that even if we suppose that there is a justification for government regulation of the fairness of broadcasters in order to ensure the public access to a diversity of opinion, still these regulations with their peculiarly restrictive character cannot be sustained because they imposed much heavier and more burdens and restrictions than are necessary Mr. Chief Justice to secure fairness and therefore they fall under the least restrictive alternative doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="6529.144" offset="26221965">It makes the ‚ÄúFace the Nation‚Äù exempt because it comes Sunday afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="6533.296" offset="26238579">But if you had a special program on Wednesday morning or Wednesday evening not exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="6537.989" offset="26257387">Its -- passes my understanding why those mechanical things should make so much difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="6544.139" offset="26281942">But the Commission itself said in paragraph 5 on page 232 that the Fairness Doctrine is applicable to this exempt categories then skipping a few lines to after the -- he stresses the considerable discretion the licensee has which says in the case of the personal attack there is not the same latitude as there is in other examples of the Fairness Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="6571.392" offset="26391030">And over on the top of page 233, that's our revision requires that fairness be met either by the licensee's action of fairly presenting the contrasting viewpoint on the attack issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="6585.646" offset="26447976">In other words, in the case of the Powell Broadcast, you must run around and get Congressman Conyers, Congressman Pepper, his wife, Judge Levy and the others and read what they have to say or otherwise state what their position is.</text>
            <text syncTime="6600.081" offset="26505759">Or else you must allow that particular group, the person, the opportunity to respond.</text>
            <text syncTime="6607.118" offset="26533867">So really this is not very much a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="6609.273" offset="26542540">The sum total difference in the case of Powell Broadcast is that instead of having to offer the time to the particular individual you may present what they have to say on the issue, that Powell raised by the attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="6624.961" offset="26605234">I think the Seventh Circuit was quite right in saying that that's an illusory exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="6630.623" offset="26627908">Now, may I just take a minute to address myself to the point which though I've slided it by misjudging my time, we do regard as being a very great importance and that is the point that these regulations are not authorized by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6650.431" offset="26707111">And the three things which I would particularly emphasize to the Court, first while the statute uses the broad language of public interest, convenience and necessity, those words might be read in the light of Section 326 which speaks in a statutory way of the broadcaster's freedom of speech and the limitation on the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="6677.961" offset="26817243">And also in the light of the fact that not once, not twice but three times the legislative process rejected proposals to put broadcasters under duties which really can't be distinguished from the duties of the Commission has now sought to put them under.</text>
            <text syncTime="6699.913" offset="26905119">The proposal in 1927 at one time was that there should be an allowance of equal treatment for the discussion of any question affecting the public and the Senate cut that down to equal time for political candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="6723.787" offset="27000519">In 1933, the Senate passed a require -- and the House passed a requirement requiring that those speaking in support of are -- in opposition to any candidate for public office or in presentation of views on public questions be given equal time and that was killed by veto and failed to become law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6745.032" offset="27085573">Now, that's really indistinguishable from the political editorial regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6749.948" offset="27105217">And then in 1933, when the Communications Act was before Congress there was a proposal to broaden Section 315 to allow equal time on any public question to be voted on in any election or by a government agency and that was killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6766.676" offset="27172091">And the point that we make is that in this area, which does trespass on journalistic freedom, freedom of speech and press that a Commission should not be found entitled in the very general words of this legislation to impose this kind of restriction until, and I am quoting Justice Roberts in Cantwell and Connecticut, ‚ÄúThe policymaking body has given the real central issue careful and purposeful consideration‚Äù and all we know about what Congress did is that it rejected essentially similar proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6810.249" offset="27346380">Now, the last point I would make is with reference to the consideration of the Fairness Doctrine in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="6820.342" offset="27386817">At that time, as the Government's brief points out, the Congress amended Section 315, the Equal Time Provision for political candidate so as to exempt certain kinds of news programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="6839.563" offset="27463722">At the same time, it said nothing in the exemption that shall have the effect of freeing any broadcaster from the duty of fairness and it is argued that this was a ratification of the Fairness Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="6854.735" offset="27524326">May I just take two minutes to finish this line of thought.</text>

            <text syncTime="6861.610" offset="27551911">We don't have to resolve that question here because in explaining the Fairness Doctrine to the congressional committees at that very time the representatives of the Commission emphasized two limitations that this regulations override and ignore its gradual increase in censorship that brings us here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6888.344" offset="27658804">One of them was the explanation that the broadcaster has full and complete authority subject only to later review of his whole operation as I say will stress to the congressional committees that considered the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="6906.668" offset="27732052">And the second statement was that when it comes to the application of the overall Fairness Standard, a licensee can exercise discretion as to which viewpoints are entitled to be expressed and which spokesman are entitled to be heard with the exception of qualified candidates from public office.</text>
            <text syncTime="6925.267" offset="27806448">Now, neither of those remains the case under the challenged regulation and we think therefore that this certainly doesn't meet the test of the most explicit statutory authorization and that there is certainly has been no careful and purposeful consideration of this kind of a breach of the freedom of the press by the policymaking body and consequently we think under, even if these question statutory interpretation were otherwise fairly balance as maybe it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="6960.377" offset="27946883">In the cases like Green and McCray, United States and Ruble and others of this kind and the policy of requiring the legislative body to face up to this question before the Court has to decide require holding that these regulations are not authorized by the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="7685.818" offset="30848669">I can well understand the Court's holding that we don't think this necessarily is the last word and that as cases come up we may need to consider it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7697.861" offset="30896839">We have a parallel with respect to unfair labor practice which I think is no more vague than the statement in this Personal Attack Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="7708.903" offset="30941038">Unfair labor practice occasionally impinges on the area of freedom of speech and the fact that what a person says may be an unfair labor practice undoubtedly has some inhibitory effect but the way that has been worked out is through the years cases come up in which particular facts appeared and somebody said something under certain circumstances and the Court decided whether or not it was an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="7735.007" offset="31045423">And it seems to me that that is what ought to be done here, that it ought to be left for the working out of the mind through the process of gradual adjudication in which it will be determined whether under certain circumstances, certain statements were personal attacks and whether the action of the Commission in response thereto was an appropriate action under those circumstances.</text>
