            <label>Mr. Howard M. Feuerstein</label>
            <text syncTime="24.264" offset="200391">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, I'm Howard M. Feuerstein of Portland, Oregon representing the petitioner Martin Rene Frazier who was a prisoner in the Oregon State Penitentiary serving a 25-year sentence for second-degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.943" offset="263189">This case involves Frazier's petition for writ of habeas corpus and involves three distinct issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.869" offset="290879">The first issue is whether Frazier was denied his right of confrontation when the prosecution placed before the jury in its opening statement the confession of a co-indictee who had later invoked his Fifth Amendment right not to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.221" offset="352214">The second issue is the admissibility of Frazier's written statement and whether that the obtaining of that statement violated Escobedo versus Illinois or in the alternative that statement was involuntarily given.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.202" offset="408221">And finally, case involved an issue of validity of a search and seizure of certain clothing of Frazier.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.074" offset="443643">The District Court granted the writ of habeas corpus on the right of confrontation and on the confession issue and did not rule on the search and seizure issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.485" offset="485334">The Warden appealed and the Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court finding against Frazier on all three issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.377" offset="516890">This Court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.968" offset="527235">If it please the Court I'll discuss the facts as they pertain to each issue separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.728" offset="550327">Frazier and his cousin Rawls were jointly indicted for first-degree murder in the strangulation slaying of one Russell Marleau.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.267" offset="588466">Frazier entered the plea of not guilty and at the time of Frazier's trial, Rawls had entered the plea of guilty to reduce charge of second-degree murder and was in jail awaiting sentence on that charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.748" offset="646353">At Frazier's trial, Frazier's defense attorney has admitted that Rawls, Frazier, and Marleau were together at the time of Marleau's death and that an altercation occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.811" offset="694627">The defense however asserted that it was Rawls who strangled Marleau and that Frazier had no part in the strangulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.900" offset="722944">The prosecution of course denied this.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.947" offset="735169">They had ample evidence placing the three at the secluded scene of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.361" offset="752828">They of course had no direct evidence as to who did the strangling because there are no other eyewitnesses.</text>

            <label>Mr. Howard M. Feuerstein</label>
            <text syncTime="169.082" offset="779682">That is correct, however, that was not the cause of the death.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.740" offset="798281">The prosecution primarily tried to impeach Frazier's version of what it transpired.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.213" offset="832240">The day in which Frazier's trial was to start prior to impaneling a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.774" offset="854497">The attorneys met with the Judge in Chambers.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.748" offset="870379">At that time, Frazier's attorney informed the district attorney that he'd heard that Rawls had been subpoenaed and that he just talked to Rawls' attorney and been informed that Rawls would not testify if called to the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.993" offset="931297">We know that prior to this time the district attorney was in possession of conflicting information on whether or not Rawls is to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.942" offset="967137">A jury was impaneled in the next day, the district attorney made his opening statement, In the course of the opening statement he said, that the officers had talked to Rawls during their investigation and that the district attorney was going to call Rawls as a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.016" offset="1031398">At this point, holding Rawls confession in his hand, the district attorney proceeded to paraphrase that confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.253" offset="1072358">The defense moved for mistrial after the opening statement which was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.538" offset="1089494">Later the district attorney called Rawls to the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.682" offset="1102137">Rawls appeared with his attorney and refuse to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.800" offset="1118542">Defense renewed his motion for mistrial and a hearing was held before the judge, the motion was denied.</text>

            <text syncTime="277.979" offset="1215300">I heard that the district attorney was holding the closing statement referring to a confession?</text>

            <label>Mr. Howard M. Feuerstein</label>
            <text syncTime="283.791" offset="1238497">Yes, as a matter (Voice Overlap).</text>
            <text syncTime="286.821" offset="1250617">It was not referred to as a confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.605" offset="1261798">If you read the opening statement which is in the appendix on pages 41 to 43, they're all in part, you'll find that for instance nearly very first the prosecutor said, “That it is Rawls' version that such and such occurred” and then he stopped and says, “Maybe I'm wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.539" offset="1329507">I will look here to see as to whether Rawls said that he hit him first” and at other times you have phrases like “Rawls said” or “It's Rawls version.”</text>
            <text syncTime="316.598" offset="1369736">So that there was a clear inference, one that the officers had talked to Rawls; two, that Rawls had given his version to the officers; and three, the inference is inescapable that what the district attorney was doing was setting out before the jury what Rawls' version was and what Rawls had told the police.</text>

            <text syncTime="340.355" offset="1464822">That is right, in fact, the defense never saw the written confession until Rawls later change his plead of not guilty and was introduced in Rawls' trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.915" offset="1503065">No specific instruction was requested of the judge and the judge did not give one to disregard these particular comments in the opening statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.586" offset="1537755">The judge did however in his general charge to the jury indicate that statements of counsel are not evidenced.</text>

            <text syncTime="372.344" offset="1592717">I think the trial lasted approximately a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.538" offset="1613511">The District Court based its decision on this Court's opinion in Douglas versus Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.186" offset="1636080">The Court may recall in that case the prosecutor by means of leading questions placed the accomplice's confession before the jury while the accomplice is on the stand asserting the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.959" offset="1691251">The Ninth Circuit on the Warden wished to distinguish Douglas versus Alabama and the later case of Bruton versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.807" offset="1722598">On the ground that here the prosecutor acted in good faith and that the statement was not unfairly prejudicial to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.688" offset="1766170">We submit, however, that the rule under Douglas and Bruton is that where the prosecution places a substance under accomplice's confession before the jury and the defendant is denied the right of confrontation if that is not subject to cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.858" offset="1842761">We submit that the defendant is just as surely denied his right to confront and cross-examine Rawls whether or not the prosecution acted in good faith or in bad faith or was merely negligent in placing this before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.415" offset="1909008">Perhaps the Ninth Circuit the Warden had confused the right of confrontation which is a fundamental right with the more general due process right against the prosecutorial misconduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="490.101" offset="2063757">The Warden also attempts to distinguish the Douglas case from the present case by saying that here the statement was made in the opening statement and was in the form of expected testimony, whereas I've already indicated the prosecutor or district attorney fairly implied that Rawls had made a statement, that Rawls had said these things so that he clearly raised the inference of past statements rather than future statements. Certainly, one cannot constitutionally distinguish the remarks of counsel who made examining witnesses' remarks of counsel were made in opening statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.818" offset="2222686">The right of confrontation is not suspended during opening statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.752" offset="2250376">The Warden has hinted that the statement was not prejudicial but we would point out that Rawls was the only other eyewitness to the crime and there was no other evidence in the case to the effect that Frazier strangled Marleau and this was the key issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.994" offset="2327385">Nor legally under Chapman versus California, can one assume that the jury forgot or ignored what the prosecutor said in his opening statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.094" offset="2375764">Surely when Rawls took the stand and refused to testify and then the motion for mistrial was made, the jury must have speculated on what Rawls would have testified and what was said in the opening statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="596.600" offset="2489762">The prosecution contends that holding the prosecution accountable what it says in its opening statement would have an adverse effect on future cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.603" offset="2541798">We submit that this is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.860" offset="2550784">If I were a prosecutor and I had a case in which I wanted to use a witness who may or may not assert his right not to testify and I have choice, I can say nothing in the opening statement about this witnesses' testimony and if he does not testify then no harm has been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.932" offset="2623091">On the other hand, if he does testify then in my closing argument I can make all the mileage out of it that I want.</text>

            <text syncTime="780.764" offset="3226415">What occurred was that after Rawls refused to testify, hearing was held and the prosecutor then told the judge under oath what his information was and as I read that testimony and as I understand it, prior to the trial, the prosecutor talked with Rawls' attorney or at least the prosecutor's deputy.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.767" offset="3298408">Rawls' attorney told the deputy they talked Rawls, Rawls would not testify.</text>

            <text syncTime="2197.553" offset="8893628">In the course of his opening statement, he is very careful in quite a number of places to be a circumspect in the positiveness with which he makes representations and I think that point is a very significant one in terms of the quality of that opening statement where he does not speak of evidence or speak of facts but speaks of what a prosecutor intends to prove and I think Mr. Rook makes that very plain throughout the entirety of his opening statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.153" offset="9043989">And I if I could cite just a few examples of that at page 30 he says, “I haven't personally talked with the witnesses that the state has and I don't know what it looks like.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.214" offset="9088188">And on page 31 he says, “I think our testimony will be.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.965" offset="9103235">And on page 33 he says, “I think that the evidence will show.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.960" offset="9119222">On page 35 he says, “I don't recall what it is” and a little further down he points out, “If my memory serves me right is that throughout the entire presentation of Mr. Rook, he is doing what any lawyer does in an opening statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.907" offset="9182960">He is outlining what he intends to prove which is something very different from having a witness on the stand as there was a witness on the stand in Douglas where the prosecutor goes over a statement.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.732" offset="9238340">And after a plea and says, “Now isn't this what you said to which the witness consistently responds with a plea of privilege under the Fifth Amendment where this is enormously different from what happened in Bruton where there is a co-defendant in the course of robbery case who testifies and there is a cautionary instruction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.013" offset="9347427">I think it is important to note that in the context of the opening, there were two other matters deemed by the defense lawyer to be of substantial importance where as the comments which Mr. Rook made about the testimony that he intended to produce from Mr. Rawls was not objected to at all in the course of that opening statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.066" offset="9439587">Although it was one of the grounds for a mistrial advanced by defense counsel immediately after the opening statement was concluded so I'm not saying that there was no timely objection made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.218" offset="9488280">I'm merely putting it in the context of the opening statement where there was an interruption and an objection by defense counsel on the question of Mr. Rook's intention to use the statement of the defendant Mr. Frazier and there was an eruption and objection by defense counsel on the reference to the items of clothing which had been the subject of search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.563" offset="9585664">But when it came to this question about Mr. Rook's reference to what he intended to produce through the testimony of the co-defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2392.935" offset="9675107">The basis for the motion at that time Mr. Justice Harlan was that the prosecuting attorney Mr. Rook had reason to know that the witness Mr. Rawls would not taken stand and therefore or would plead privilege against self-incrimination and therefore it would not be before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.513" offset="9753475">And this matter was inquired into fully and appears in terms of Mr. Rook's reply at page 82 for the transcript and Mr. Rook made reference to three specific reasons why he believe that Mr. Rawls was going to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.271" offset="9848456">And those three reasons were, number one, that Lieutenant Thomas of the Sheriff's office reported to me this is his testimony “that he felt sure that Mr. Rawls was going to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.620" offset="9901850">Next, he receives statement from Mr. Ore of the probation office that Mr. Rawls was going to testify and did not want to take the fifth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.100" offset="9935809">And third, that Rawls' two brothers and or mother -- I am not sure of that; I'm reading from the record here at least two of them or three of them had talked to him and advised me that although counsel advised him not to testify, he thought he wanted to testify and he was going to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.420" offset="10009057">And Mr. Rook, on the next page says I'm talking about the information I had in my head at the time that these events occurred and it is of course not of unusual procedure for a defense counsel thinking based on information which he may have had perhaps in an earlier date of that the plea of privilege would be entered to attempt to dissuade a prosecutor from going ahead with that line of evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2533.185" offset="10236113">I think that if the petitioner's point is adopted on this line that there would be a very substantial undercutting of the prosecutor's right to make an opening speech and I think this case illustrates it very well because there were objections made to three points; two of them actually during the course of the speech and the third one afterwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.459" offset="10345200">On three of the essential points of evidence which the prosecutor was going to put forward; first, the defendant's statement itself, secondly, the expected testimony of a co-defendant and third, an outline of the evidence which have been subject to search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.954" offset="10411238">Now, anyone of these points might have been rendered inadmissible although the search and seizure point had been cleared for a pretrial motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.889" offset="10450944">But if we would to take the position of defense counsel at the trial that a prosecutor could not go into these items.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.057" offset="10479574">It is claimed from this case that the major substance of what the prosecutor was going to talk about to the jury would be stricken from the scope of his opening speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.886" offset="10526908">And I think that the right in the prosecutor to make the opening outline is a very crucial one when the prosecution has the burden of proof when the facts very frequently or disjointed when there has to be some outline to be followed to give the jury some thread as to what is coming and how they fit into the overall picture disconnected bits of evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2675.102" offset="10803806">I would want to make one thing perfectly plain and that is that Mr. Rook never referred to a confession of call by Mr. Rawls.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.302" offset="10832541">Never said it was a confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.235" offset="10840273">He said, “Rawls have made the statement” and I think it is a fair inference, Mr. Justice Marshall points out that he had a written statement to that effect but he never said it was a confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.402" offset="10884995">And he then proceeded to outline what happened when those three men were together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.164" offset="10907982">He faced precisely that problem when he was to make references to the statement of the defendant Mr. Frazier.</text>

            <text syncTime="2904.843" offset="11722794">No, Your Honor, I do not think that is what was done here and the best indication that that is not what was done here is what the trial court said on the motion for a mistrial immediately afterward where contemporaneously witness in event.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.809" offset="11782562">Now, the trial judge said that there was not a reference to the written statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.827" offset="11810670">I submit to Your Honor that at the very most what was done here was that this piece of paper was held in the hands of the District Attorney just as he would hold his own sheet of notes, and that it is all written here as to what he said and he did not make any reference to this being a statement word by word as to what this man had said certainly no reference at all to the issue of a confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.155" offset="11931982">I think the strongest indication that this item was not of real consequence in this trial is the absence of a request by the defense for a cautionary instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.435" offset="12001155">A cautionary instruction of course may serve to remind the jury as to what has occurred and a cautionary instruction may not be observable by a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.680" offset="12046085">But I think it is a fair inference from this record that there was a calculated decision made and I think perhaps a wise man from a trial point of view by the defense attorney that there would be no request for a cautionary instruction because this portion of the trial was so minimal that the defendant was better off having it not referred to, than he was getting an instruction that the jury should disregard this kind of evidence as was done for example United States versus Namet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.034" offset="12179519">So, that I think that really puts in prospective the question here as to the factor that it was not of really substantial importance in the course of this trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="3062.254" offset="12352345">I would like, if I may to deal very briefly with the question of search and seizure before coming to the perhaps more substantial consideration on the Escobedo argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.651" offset="12398007">I think that the facts in this case show rather emphatically that the police officers were justified and going through this duffel bag where they had no indication about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.761" offset="12450461">In fact, belong to Mr. Frazier, the defendant in this case now that the duffel bag is something of limited size not knowing which compartment, whose clothes were in and that they then came upon these items of clothing which had in fact been worn by the defendant, Mr. Frazier blood spots and stains of clothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.740" offset="12526320">And under the decision of Harris versus United States last year by this Court, coming upon objects falling in the plain view of an officer, there certainly was a right to take those items and to use them in the course of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.213" offset="12588178">The duffel bag -- they searched the duffel bag and then consented to by both Mr. Rawls and by Mr. Rawls' mother, the aunt of this defendant, and I think it was well within the ambit of permissibility on search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.145" offset="12655992">The question on the statement presents some greater difficulty but I would submit to Your Honors first of all that the facts of this situation are well within the ambit of permissibility under the Escobedo decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.254" offset="12744391">There, was the single statement by this defendant Mr. Frazier that he was about to get himself into more trouble but he had been advised earlier in the course of the questioning that he could have an attorney if he want an attorney why you can have an attorney and the police further said, “What you say here could be used against you in the trial, do you understand that?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.028" offset="12843447">And there was an affirmative answer, the answer yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.212" offset="12864240">I think that the case is put in real perspective by the argument of petitioner's counsel when he comes to this question of, “Was the will of the defendant, Mr. Frazier here overborne by aggressive interrogation?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.652" offset="12953997">And I would submit to Your Honors that this is a classical case to show from a tape recording which was made at the time of this interrogation which is reprinted in full that there was an abundance of fairness and there was an abundance of propriety by these police officers in the course of their questioning of this defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.023" offset="13051486">The arrest in this case, he was taken into custody at 4:15, he arrived at the detective headquarters at 4:50 and he was questioned from 5:05 to 5:10, and he ended shortly after 6:00 so there was approximately one hour of questioning in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.546" offset="13133511">I would submit to Your Honors that if the Court concludes that the statement of the defendant, Frazier is not within the purview of the Escobedo decision that the Court reversed Escobedo and adopt in its place the standards which are set forth in the Crime Control Act adopted by Congress last June.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.952" offset="13251166">I would submit to Your Honors that this really puts into focus the test which has been suggested here by counsel for petitioner as to whether the confession was voluntary in its entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.202" offset="13304142">The Federal Crime Control Act is now the law of the land presumptively constitutional and certainly a more stringent standard should not be applied to the states than that which is applied to the federal government.</text>
