            <label>Mr. Osmond K. Fraenkel</label>
            <text syncTime="13.261" offset="158448">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.566" offset="171719">This is an appeal from the decision of a three-judge court in the Eastern District of New York rejecting an attack on the constitutionality of Section 2012 of the New York Education Law brought by this plaintiff representing himself and others in the same class.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.867" offset="264923">It deals with the qualifications for elections in local school districts and this particular statute restricts the voting to roughly two groups of persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.384" offset="334932">The owners or renters of taxable real estate and their spouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.924" offset="361159">Although at the time the suit was brought, the spouse of a tenant wasn't qualified but has become so since and parents of children attending the local schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.120" offset="405880">First, excluding persons like the particular plaintiff who is a bachelor living -- an adult of course living with his parents excluding also older people living with their children, excluding lodgers and boarders and excluding residents of property which happens to be non-taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.941" offset="509221">The majority of the Court below upheld the law on the ground that the interest of the taxpayers and parents was more direct than the interests of the other residents of the community and that the state therefore had the right to make that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.003" offset="593439">Judge Weinstein wrote a long and, to our view of course, a most persuasive dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.824" offset="628757">Now, the election system in New York with respect to schools is most bizarre.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.567" offset="663656">In a large city like New York, the school board is appointed, although the project for decentralization of which the members of the court may have read and the new proposal by the Board of Education which had been much publicized would give all the residents of local districts the right to elect their local school boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.391" offset="754981">In some of the other cities in New York, school boards are elected at large cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.590" offset="775774">In all cities in New York having population of 125,000 or less, school boards are elected by the entire electorate.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.200" offset="814226">It's only in the so-called country and suburban areas such as the one here involved down on Long Island that there is this distinction and restriction to taxpayers and parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.874" offset="880891">Other state doesn't really support that distinction by anything which in our view conforms to this Court's most recent discussion of the question of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.735" offset="952362">In Williams against Rhodes where the Court noted that we have to balance the interest of the state in the exclusion which it proposed against the interest of the person excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.375" offset="1014951">Now, here the interest of the person excluded is quite obvious be as a resident of the community and particularly in modern times where the growing interest in education, the growing ferment, not only among the community people but among the students themselves is to how their education should be handled.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.453" offset="1103245">It would seem a priori that everyone in the community should have a right to participate in the election of the school officials provided there be an election at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.408" offset="1155072">This Court having previously of course has determined that a state would have such local officials appointed.</text>

            <text syncTime="588.249" offset="2458373">It's been changed from time to time by some amelioration and it may be of interest that when the Constitution was proposed in New York in 1967, that Constitution would have expressly forbidden any such restriction in local elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.394" offset="2543010">That Constitution for many reasons was not adopted by the people as Your Honor knows.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.660" offset="2572058">Now, one of the arguments made here is that the state was justified in making this discrimination because those two groups are likely to be most interested and best informed.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.619" offset="2631931">It seems to me, the short answer to that is that anybody who wants to vote lives in the community shows an interest and shouldn't be deprived of that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.595" offset="2679787">It is also suggested in one of the briefs that there is a political process available to amend the law and that the law from time to time has been amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.088" offset="2725763">That may be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.413" offset="2731092">Lord knows, how long it might take.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.853" offset="2740809">But that isn't I suggest no answer at all to any constitutional argument in every case where a statute is challenged as denying the Equal Protection Clause, it was of course possible to have the statute amended whether it was a tax case or a -- any other kind of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.328" offset="2822729">It also suggested in some of the briefs or I put it this way, horrible examples are produced at least in one of the briefs about what would happen if this restriction were removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.615" offset="2871839">It is said a child of eight from California would come and show an interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.566" offset="2899634">Well that's of course is non-sense because the basic requirement for voting in New York is a certain amount of residence in the state and in the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.993" offset="2937354">And that provision is not being attacked in this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.701" offset="2952192">All that we are saying is that that provision is to the general voting qualification of New York should be applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.666" offset="2988136">It is also suggested that if this law is stricken down, there'll be no law for school elections and that would produce chaos.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.498" offset="3027425">Now, of course that is not true because all we are asking this Court to do is to strike down the discrimination of the law and it is very easily accomplished because after the pre am -- first portion of the law which says persons are qualified to vote in school elections who are qualified under the general law of the state and possess certain additional qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.450" offset="3135258">All we're asking is that the “and posses these additional qualifications be stricken.”</text>
            <text syncTime="762.743" offset="3156365">For that would leave the law in full force applicable to school elections in these districts but giving the right to vote in those districts to persons otherwise qualified to vote in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.939" offset="3205162">So in sum, our position is that this plaintiff and other similarly situated have a vital interest in the subject matter of being members of the community who want to vote and participate in the election of the school officials and that the mere fact that taxpayers and parents might have what might be called a more direct interest is no justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.147" offset="3321981">Indeed, one of the briefs go so far as to suggest that if it were otherwise a theoretical delegate ballots between the normal desire of taxpayers to keep school budgets down and the hopeful desire of parents to have better education and better facilities and therefore increase the school budgets that that nice ballots which might be preserved by the existing system would be thrown out if outsiders came in who were in need of financially prejudiced group.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.591" offset="3471820">Whereas on the contrary, it would seem to be in the general public interest that this possible theoretical deadline would be resolved by persons having a general public interest in the education of the children and in all of the other aspects that arise in connection with local school elections because there are various collateral and what might be called fringe aspects to those situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.655" offset="3592088">The local school board has great power in connection with first, the recreation facilities, libraries and things of that sort, so we say here that the state has not shown anything to justify this discrimination and that the restrictive provisions of other law should be stricken by --</text>

            <text syncTime="1600.504" offset="6507457">This is a very important case I believe and it also I believe were one of the first impressions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.864" offset="6528878">It involves such matters as the relationship between the State and the Federal government and also between the Judiciary and Legislative branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.833" offset="6560747">Now, perhaps in answer to some of the questions, the questions I asked of Mr. Fraenkel, I should say this that Boards of Education and School Districts in the State of New York are autonomous units.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.121" offset="6609857">The statute sets for instance the requirements as to required subjects in the curriculum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.809" offset="6632636">Beyond that, the local board of education can determine to have other subject in their choice and the Board of Regents under Commission of Education of course have supervisory powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.221" offset="6674328">The Commissioner of Education has particularly the judicial powers over the school system where regular pleadings and oral arguments and briefs are filed and so forth and then the local, the statutes in New York says, his decisions are final and not subject to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.389" offset="6734932">Now, the Courts of the state however have happily reviewed them all along.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.206" offset="6750292">But in any event, the districts are very autonomous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.872" offset="6764920">There is over 800 school districts in the state and the statute here 2012 and I might add to that also requires three general qualifications together with one of three specials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.382" offset="6818941">The three generals are residence, citizenship and majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.454" offset="6835242">In addition to that, one of three qualifications have to bring a qualified vote to be qualified into the community of interest in the school system which is a special purpose administrative not legislative units only it does administer to schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.160" offset="6910056">Under the jurisdiction, general jurisdiction of the education department because under the State Constitution and the law in New York, education is a state function as it is under the Tenth Amendment is a state function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.842" offset="6968780">Now, to go into the problem of this particular case, this is a matter as I said under the Tenth Amendment of state concern only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.541" offset="7003575">There is nothing in the United States Constitution or in any Act of Congress that guarantees to anybody in this country the right to vote in school district meetings or elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.307" offset="7050700">And an answer incidentally to Mr. Justice Stewart's question before, the voting takes place either at meetings, town meeting types or at election types which is up to the local board as which as they are the one going to handle it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2625.041" offset="10605547">In the first place, do we have to meet a test such as we had in the Cardona case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.616" offset="10639924">Now, in Cardona, we have this Mrs. Cardona who was disfranchised by the statute and she could not in any way do anything about it because being disfranchised you have no access to the franchise to change that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.293" offset="10694572">Here on the other hand, we have a person who is not disfranchised on state legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.284" offset="10718605">If he wants to change that 2012, he can go and vote for people who will go and change it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.688" offset="10740130">And I might say in this connection, while this lawsuit was going on, as a matter of fact, some of the things that were criticized below have been amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.826" offset="10768760">The spouse of the tenant which Judge Weinstein said should not be excluded and I think Judge Hayes have long since been put in by the legislature and that the statement was made, there are so few of these people that the legislative processes will not be adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.963" offset="10829260">And at the same time, it was done and we have, as I point out on our supplemental brief there is now a constitutional amendment again before the state legislature to eliminate all these special things but the purpose of it and this is to answer your question Mr. Justice Marshall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.831" offset="10892790">In order for the legislature to make sure that this extremely important business of elementary and secondary education is properly determined under local basis where it has to be determined under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.004" offset="10937407">He must make sure that those people who get the franchise on that are those people who can reasonably be expected to be interested enough in it, to spend the considerable amount of time necessary to really inform yourself on these very complicated questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2725.730" offset="11008355">Let me ask you this question, suppose the appellant in this case was a school teacher instead of a stock broker and he was boarding in a home, would you presume to say that he had no interest in the public school's sufficient to enable him to be a voter?</text>

            <text syncTime="2749.710" offset="11104277">One is the mere fact that he's interested and knowledgeable for all know, he may have written all the books in education but the legislature cannot anticipate when they make this rule that those persons who are not in the category, that were the two categories we're talking about, will have naturally and foreseeably the kind of interest which will guarantee a reasonable decision on school matters.</text>

            <text syncTime="2775.546" offset="11207617">A school teacher or any other person not being a real property taxpayer who is retired and living with one of his children, maybe he's had a large family and has reared them and put them through the public schools, paid all their expenses and they now have grandchildren and he is living with one of those children.</text>

            <text syncTime="2814.635" offset="11363934">I would say Your Honor that they're properly excluded here because the parents themselves is the -- if they have the children, the people you're talking about whose grandchildren do have the franchise but the interest of these other people is purely theoretical just like I have a tremendous interest in good education in Mississippi right now.</text>

            <text syncTime="2835.519" offset="11447526">You say that he had insufficient interest to vote.</text>

            <text syncTime="2842.384" offset="11475007">If he rents a garage for instance or if he owns a home then obviously he has the kind of interest that the legislature reasonably can be expected to base a decision on as to who should vote and who should not.</text>

            <text syncTime="2857.819" offset="11536656">You say, because he pays no taxes could you now, if we sustain this, could you also say that unless he paid the $10,000.00 in taxes a year that they wouldn't be eligible to vote?</text>

            <text syncTime="2873.920" offset="11601126">All he has to be is assessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.894" offset="11608963">Now, if he for instance refused to pay taxes, being assessed, he may not lose his property for two years.</text>

            <text syncTime="2900.520" offset="11707496">This is put in merely to make sure that we have those people, those groups, who can reasonably be expected to have a serious interest, serious enough to give it a great deal of thought.</text>

            <text syncTime="2931.661" offset="11832048">This is not applicable, so consequently, the only test we do not need that the far sterner test of Justices Douglas and Fortas are mentioned in their dissent in Cardona.</text>
