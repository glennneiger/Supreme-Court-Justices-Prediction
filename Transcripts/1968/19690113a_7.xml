            <text syncTime="18.957" offset="179179">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.367" offset="200808">Few cases that I have seen in recent years, so much invoke the ancient admonition owe to distinguish the reality of things from the tyranny of labels, or as this Court put it I believe in Trop against Dulles, how simple would be the task of constitution of adjudication if the decision of specific problems were a matter of selecting the labels pasted upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.125" offset="351901">We respectfully submit Your Honors that the court, the three-judge District Court below in the Western District of Texas by seizing upon the label of Dombrowski against Pfister without penetrating through to the context and the meaning in context of that teaching of this Court that the three-judge court has done violence to the realities of the situation as defied logic experience and history and requires reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.471" offset="537266">Now, our facts here Your Honors are from a stipulation between the appellants and the appellees counsel and from the affidavits filed by the individual plaintiffs and the few of their fellow students and the affidavits of the sheriff of Bell County, Texas and his deputies.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.532" offset="661504">That's the source of the facts here, those stipulation and affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.135" offset="687940">Very briefly on December 12, 1967, just a little more than four years within the shadow of Dallas, the President went to Central Texas College to make a dedicatory speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.217" offset="788250">The night before his arrival, the secret service had a conference with the local police officers of the surrounding cities, with the sheriffs of both counties, the land involved here lies in both Bell and Coryell counties had a conference soliciting cooperation in protection of the defendant -- in protection of the president.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.128" offset="903920">On the morning of December 12, the plaintiffs and others, member of the committee, our associates, hearing that this event was going to take place started out from Austin about 60 or 70 miles from Collin and proceeded to the neighborhood of Collin, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.975" offset="1019277">This college is near Collin. Collin serves one of the biggest military reservations in the United States Fort Hood, thousands of troops stationed there, many of them on the way to Vietnam, many of them just returned from Vietnam.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.433" offset="1109138">These people at least seven in number and at least in two automobiles proceeded to the area of the college where the president was to speak and when they arrived there, he had begun to speak or was about to begin.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.787" offset="1178520">They have their signs, their signs of protest against the war in Vietnam.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.296" offset="1212583">Very shortly, almost immediately I think I can say, after their arrival on the scene, violence broke out.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.207" offset="1256155">I think I can put in a nutshell the condition of the violence by reference to one item in the evidence, a big burly sergeant was heard to remark, “Let me add them, they'd never seen blood.”</text>
            <text syncTime="306.542" offset="1329507">There were 50 cops, their signs were torn to shreds, it was a dangerous situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="553.593" offset="2317772">That's the first proposition.</text>

            <text syncTime="2155.281" offset="8724459">Well, we allege that that's what we involved and the appellants here denied in their answer that the 474 was unconstitutional and we stipulated in that stipulation that what was in issue was Article 474.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.180" offset="8796139">All of which, it was raised before the three-judge court on the motion to a new trial analyzed by a three-judge court and the three-judge court says clearly, we've been litigate in Article 474 here, we would have been here to start with.</text>
