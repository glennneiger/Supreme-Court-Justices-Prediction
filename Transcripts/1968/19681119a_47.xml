            <label>Mr. Kenneth L. Maddy</label>
            <text syncTime="36.273" offset="248456">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.432" offset="261099">Before this Court -- this matter is before this Court in the writ of certiorari to the Fifth District Court of Appeal in California limited to the question of whether the conduct of a police lineup resulted in the violation of petitioner's constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.889" offset="330898">We make two contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.279" offset="340511">First, that the actions of the police in the conduct of two lineups and a personal confrontation between the petitioner, Walter Foster and a witness to an armed robbery unnecessarily was suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistake in identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.072" offset="423685">This was a violation of Mr. Foster's rights under due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.858" offset="446777">The second point is that the personal confrontation between Mr. Foster and the witness violated the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.209" offset="496201">This first issue was based on the holding in Stovall versus Denno which was decided last year by this Court with the other lineup decisions of United States versus Wade and Gilbert versus California.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.573" offset="553671">I might point out that Foster's trial and the decision of the Fifth District Court of Appeal, the original trial result in a conviction of Mr. Foster and the Fifth District Court of Appeal in California affirmed occurred prior to the decisions in Stovall, Wade and Gilbert.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.074" offset="623679">To properly pursue the question to due process which is our principal contention, I wish to review the facts of the case with particular emphasis on the events and circumstances surrounding the lineups.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.447" offset="681148">The crime charge was armed robbery of a Western Union Office in Fresno in January 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.413" offset="713017">The victim was the late night manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.577" offset="725661">He was the only witness to the robbery, a man by the name of Joseph David.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.500" offset="745409">He testified that two men entered the office shortly after midnight on January 25, 1966 and after appearing to make out a MoneyGram, approached him at the counter with guns pointed at him and handed him a holdup note.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.276" offset="824508">He described these two men as one tall individual dressed in coveralls with a hat pulled down over his face and visible under the coveralls a black leather jacket.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.926" offset="891068">The shorter of the man was dressed as he described in casual clothes and a suit coat.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.333" offset="916668">The man after handing the holdup note to him required him to open the safe and a money box to hand the money to the taller of the men at which time the taller men left the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.399" offset="969017">The shorter man stayed three or four minutes later making certain threatening gestures to the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.361" offset="996812">Without relating in greater detail the facts of the crime, I wish to point out the significance of certain items.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.277" offset="1036518">First of all that the short time that the tall individual as indicated in the record was in the office, this man was ultimately described or stated by the witness to be Walter Foster, he was there three minutes at the outside perhaps six minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.594" offset="1101720">Part of that time, the witness was facing a gun held by this tall robber.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.283" offset="1120528">The second is the contradiction in the description of the dress of the witness of the shorter man.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.779" offset="1146441">The shorter individual ultimately testified at time of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.685" offset="1166085">And third was the fact that the witness changed the description of the coloring of the individual -- the tall individual at the time of trial because as he indicated the background of the office was such that he had to make this change at time of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.889" offset="1238915">All these points go to the one fact that the witness had little chance for observation of the individuals that robbed the office that evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.746" offset="1286353">And as pointed out in the Wade decision, Mr. David was a likely suspect for prompting or for the effects of an improper lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.714" offset="1342255">I mentioned that the witness ultimately described or stated that the tall individual was Walter Foster.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.493" offset="1369318">This was only after the two lineups and a personal confrontation to briefly complete the background of the case J. V. Clay, testified for the prosecution at the time of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.140" offset="1427937">He indicated that he was the shorter man that robbed the Western Union office that night.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.935" offset="1447163">He admitted full participation however, gave certain statements in the basis of his testimony was that he was ordered to do these things by Walter Foster for a $50.00 sum.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.244" offset="1496377">He fully implicated Foster and a John Henry Grice as a third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.210" offset="1524172">Now the significance of Clay's testimony, I believe, is that number one, he contradicted Mr. David in so far as the clothing that he wore himself that night which again I think goes to the point that the lack of chance for observation.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.610" offset="1581850">The second point is that he gave a statement one day after the robbery to the police implicating Foster and Grice in this robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.867" offset="1618840">Now, I wish to point out to the Court California Penal Code Section 1111 which appears and I think appendix B of the respondent's brief requires cooperation of an accomplice's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.016" offset="1675473">Now the situation has placed the police in at the time they receive the statement from Mr. Clay was that they had one man, one participant in the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.233" offset="1728345">They knew who the second one was or they felt they knew who the second one was and as we point out in the brief, Mr. Foster was perhaps a likely man for the police, he had a previous record.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.657" offset="1777977">The problem that they had was to have Mr. David identify.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.278" offset="1792502">Mr. David, the lone witnesses identified Mr. Foster as not unlike the situation outlined in Palmer versus Payton which is referred to by the Court in Stovall versus Denno where they talked about the understandable zeal of the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.511" offset="1861465">They believe that Foster was their man.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.492" offset="1873377">The question was whether the witness would identify him.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.803" offset="1890617">Turning to the lineups, two or three days after the robbery the witness was called to the police station to view a lineup, there were three men present.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.571" offset="1937638">The witness had testified that the one man was a taller man, approximately six foot tall who was in the lineup, hatless and was wearing a black leather jacket similar to what he said he saw under the coveralls of one of the individuals who robbed him.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.880" offset="2006915">The other two men were shorter men five foot five, five foot six, they were both required to wear hats, they both -- and one had a mustache.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.403" offset="2049024">Evaluating this first lineup in terms of the considerations outlined in Wade, we would have to say that Foster, number one was the lone tall suspect, he was the only one wearing clothes similar to that which was allegedly worn by one of the men that robbed the Western Union office.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.003" offset="2135333">Both of these factors are things that were outlined in Wade, are part of the problems of lineups, problems of the police making suggestive factors available to the witness at the time of the lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.788" offset="2214536">Now assuming that the witness gave a description of the men who robbed into the police indicating the dress that they wore, this first lineup, the composition of it clearly made Foster's stand out, yet Mr. David did not make any identification at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.830" offset="2290709">Shortly, after the lineup or at the time of the lineup he requested to speak to the individual later identified as Mr. Foster, this was the personal confrontation I spoke of.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.455" offset="2345148">Foster, the witness, the policeman and the Deputy District Attorney went to a private room where a conversation was held between Foster and David.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.373" offset="2392900">I'll point out that no part of the conversation was introduced into evidence merely the fact that a conversation did take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.691" offset="2422157">Now we analogize this to the widely condemned practice of the single suspect confrontation.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.826" offset="2450683">Palmer versus Payton and Justice Douglas in his dissent in Biggers versus Tennessee last term, elaborated on the evils of the single suspect confrontation.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.052" offset="2491538">It's clear that the witness has no alternative but this one individual that he's looking at.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.026" offset="2515466">The police in effect are saying this is the man.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.724" offset="2530304">The second aspect related to our particular case is that this was a special procedure or an isolation of Foster versus the other two men in the lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.114" offset="2575862">They handled him differently, it's very hard to imagine a more suggestive situation and for the police to take one man to isolate him and to treat him differently in so far as the witnesses are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.675" offset="2634062">They could do nothing more if they turned around and said this is the man we believe is guilty of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.569" offset="2661648">Now, no further Court the case of Crum versus Beddow (ph) 383 F.2d which is outlined -- I think is listed in both the briefs which presented a similar situation in so far as isolating an individual from a lineup at the request of a one of the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.458" offset="2737194">Now, the court there looked at the situation and stated that this is very well a situation that violates due process to do this, to pull the men out, to suggest to the man -- the witnesses that this is the man.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.576" offset="2797693">The distinguishing feature in the Crum (ph) case was the fact that there the witness said, “I'm sure this is the man.”</text>
            <text syncTime="682.750" offset="2834369">The court pointed out that if this had not -- if the positive identification had not been made by the witness that this very well would have been a violation of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.781" offset="2874493">After this personal confrontation, the witness David still made no identification of Foster.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.042" offset="2903542">Ten days later the police presented the crowning blow, they called Mr. David back to a second lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.603" offset="2945755">There were five men present.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.762" offset="2954428">They were all dressed similarly in jail (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="717.135" offset="2971878">Yet, the only man that was present in the second lineup who had been seen by David and present in the first lineup was Walter Foster.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.157" offset="3008031">We ask the question of what more could the police do?</text>
            <text syncTime="730.023" offset="3023496">To suggest and to implicate Foster as the individual that they were asking David to identify, the respondents indicate this is a situation where we just had a super cautious witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.045" offset="3091519">I think the record clearly shows it's a situation where the witness could not identify the individual who was there until forced upon him by suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.891" offset="3138957">Now, if it please the Court we contend that each step taken by the police in the prosecution can be criticized as suggestive and unfair and pointed to Foster but more important is the cumulative effect of each of these three steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.265" offset="3212413">They made adversely impossible for the witness to make any identification other than that of Foster.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.745" offset="3246373">I think that one other aspect of this is that question of the necessity or as pointed out in Stovall versus Denno by Justice Brennan that the totality of the circumstances surrounding the lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.588" offset="3305723">The respondents, it seemed to tie this in this question of totality of the circumstances with the harmless error rule and ask the Court in our brief to review all the facts of the case before deciding the due process issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.367" offset="3364864">We dispute this.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.531" offset="3369462">We interpret this reference to the totality of the circumstances to mean the events and circumstances surrounding the lineup alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.726" offset="3402271">What prompted the action of the police to bring about the lineup in the manner in which they did in Stovall versus Denno there was a dying witness that brought about the single suspect confrontation.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.100" offset="3459741">That single suspect confrontation was criticized but it was said that under all the circumstances the case that this was not a denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.091" offset="3495685">In the Unites States versus Simmons which was decided last term there were the suspects where at large and it was indicated that there was a need for identification immediately with use of photographs, again, the totality of the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.529" offset="3549497">People versus Ford and State versus Sears which are cited in respondent's briefs where situations of on the spot apprehensions of individual suspected a crime and on the spot identifications which again are situations I believe that are involved the totality of the circumstances surrounding the lineup alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.053" offset="3635597">Necessary procedures which prevented a traditional lineup but when considers a whole -- when the lineups are considered as a whole they were not a violation of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.367" offset="3680841">I believe that in our case we have none of those circumstances, there are no imperative circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.081" offset="3707695">Foster was under arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.093" offset="3715741">There was no necessity to proceed or to deviate from established procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.517" offset="3749491">No excuse.</text>

            <text syncTime="1125.056" offset="4603591">Once that point is considered, we feel that that is a basic right as indicated in Chapman versus California and would require a reversal at that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="1724.967" offset="7003199">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.480" offset="7021275">We would also call the Court's attention at this point to the language in page 33 of the appendix, Mr. Justice Stewart has read from page 39 and this is the identification of Mr. David -- of Mr. Foster at the first line that were he states in answer to a question, “Now with the first lineup, did you identify any person?</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.709" offset="7118242">Was the defendant Foster in the lineup?</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.301" offset="7128586">I did not at that time say specifically, “Well, let me ask you first with the defendant Foster in the lineup.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.940" offset="7155127">“Yes, sir he was.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.132" offset="7159933">“And did you identify him?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.499" offset="7165367">I didn't specifically say, “That is the man.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.644" offset="7173935">I said, “I thought it was.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.009" offset="7187414">Now, we believe that as an answer to the reason and right after that where the witness asked for the second lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.036" offset="7235480">In this case, the rule of Stovall versus Denno should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.589" offset="7269752">The case was tried prior to Wade or Gilbert, therefore, the basic question of counsel at the time of lineups is a critical stage of the proceeding is not a first importance in this particular case since under the rule of Stovall it would not be retroactively applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.127" offset="7355852">However, in Stovall this Court nevertheless, permitted a consideration of the confrontation depending on the totality of the circumstances surrounding it to consider a claim of lack of due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.248" offset="7444355">The petitioner in this case urges that the term “totality of circumstances” be limited solely to the exact circumstances of the lineup and not taken to consideration the entire case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.160" offset="7512064">It is a position of the respondent that we would at least broaden the scope of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.404" offset="7537037">To take into consideration the facts involved prior to the time of the lineup proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.981" offset="7575280">Now, some of the criteria which may be used to determine whether the action of the police have been suggestive and tending to establish mistaken identification have been set forth as whether any preliminary information about the suspect was given to the witness or the victim prior to the time of lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.680" offset="7682069">Whether, the victim knew the members of the lineup except for the suspect, whether, there was a prior identification by the witness or the victim of another individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.033" offset="7743509">Whether, there was a discrepancy between the preliminary lineup description and the actual one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.123" offset="7775901">Whether, the witness or victim had an opportunity to observe the defendant at the time of the criminal act, the time that had elapsed between the crime and the lineup and then the facts pertaining to the actual lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.345" offset="7860746">If we apply these criteria to the instant case, then we have in the first lineup it took place shortly after the robbery and after the co-defendant, Clay had turn himself into the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.077" offset="7935666">He then had apparently designated Foster as his co-defendant, Foster was apprehended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.788" offset="7974536">At that time, the three men, the victim Mr. David was asked to come to the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.057" offset="8003584">He was not told that they had apprehended any suspects, he was just asked to view a lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.498" offset="8041409">In this lineup there were three men, they were all Negroes petitioner admittedly was the tallest by Mr. David's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.855" offset="8078817">However, two of the other participants in the lineup who were shorter both had hats on which the robber did at the time of the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.915" offset="8147048">Petitioner, Mr. Foster had on a leather jacket but this apparently was his own leather jacket because he wore it at the time of the robbery underneath the coverall that was the distinguishing feature of the identification of Mr. David.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.513" offset="8229386">This lineup was not like Wade or Gilbert subsequent to the appointment of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.060" offset="8259584">It probably was prior to arraignment of petitioner's since it was practically immediately after the petitioner's apprehension.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.607" offset="8301798">There was no prompting of Mr. David the witness prior to this lineup by the police.</text>

            <text syncTime="2557.762" offset="10334438">This was not raised nor was any of the objections raised in motion for a new draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.891" offset="10354918">This fact appears in the opinion of the Fifth District Court of Appeals in the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2581.869" offset="10430882">So that there was no question such as Palmer versus Patent that the question of voice identification was the ultimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.505" offset="10477380">At the time of the robbery, Mr. Foster spoke demanding the victim go get the money from the safe and told him to do it and then hurry and get the particular box.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.627" offset="10561912">Now, this request to get the particular box would tie in with his identity in which there was evidence brought forth at the trial of a prior conviction of Mr. Foster before a robbery of a Western Union Station in which there were -- was brought forth both on the ground of similarity of modus operandi and for purposes of identity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3250.768" offset="13106448">Well, we would go one further point to the Court's attention and that is at the time of this trial and under California law, the petitioner would have the right and have the right to have discovery proceedings in a criminal case that this petitioner would have had full opportunity to ascertain all the fact in circumstances of the lineup by a motion to obtain the statements of the witnesses to that lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.574" offset="13273631">The police officers that were present and including any photos that may have been taken of the lineup by the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.925" offset="13315114">California case of Norton versus Superior Court decided in 1959, some six years or seven prior to the trial of this case would have given counsel for petitioner the right to obtain all of this material prior to its cross-examination for purposes of testing the identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.503" offset="13409364">Therefore, we have a rather unusual situation in this respect since the information was available to him and no showing was made in the record of whether petitioner did or did not avail of himself of it but he could have.</text>

            <text syncTime="3376.872" offset="13610820">The goal was I -- correct the identification, a utilization of these procedures avoided by California would have given him full opportunity to explore this rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="3407.742" offset="13734327">May it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.980" offset="13743313">Just one or two comments on the statements of Ms. Maier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.907" offset="13762957">First of all, an answer to the two points she made concerning discovery rules in California and concerning what Mr. David, the witness said at the time of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.653" offset="13809977">I think that they're both significant because they both point out to the real dangers involve with lineup situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.091" offset="13839757">First of all, discovery is not going to do the attorney any good except in the manner that he can bring things out on cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.578" offset="13877687">As an attorney, you're face with the problem of how far are you going to push on cross-examination because your first intent at that time is to win your case if you can at the time of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.432" offset="13921050">You can't try the case and hope that or the prospect as Mr. Foster to sit in false imprisonment for two years, waiting for a court such as this to change the decision based on the records you established.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.393" offset="13976952">In other words, I think this is the danger the prosecution is not going to bring out all the events of the lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.924" offset="13999104">They're going to put a witness on the stand who says, as Mr. David did, “I'm positively sure that that's the man as I see him sitting there today.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.929" offset="14035048">The point is that he made that determination based on the improper conduct of the lineup procedures before he got to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.715" offset="14074232">I think the majority of the cases do not show that the prosecution goes into prior lineups unless the individual, the witnesses cannot say for sure of the time of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.877" offset="14114879">He has to refer that to the lineups.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.895" offset="14127000">So I think that the two points that the respondent makes our both pointing out dangers involved with the lineup situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.047" offset="14159600">The second point, I want to make is that Ms. Maier made to reference certain factors that should be considered by the Court in reviewing the lineups.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.573" offset="14205680">She mentioned, had the witness seen the man before?</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.522" offset="14221458">Was he seen in the custody of police before?</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.062" offset="14235669">Did he know anyone in the lineup?</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.435" offset="14245073">Now, we feel and I contend that the second lineup is the most important lineup here because all of the things that she mentioned were violated in the second lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.803" offset="14282585">As I said that's crowning blow as far as the composition of the second lineup was concern it could have been perfect as far as height and appearances of the individuals but the significant point was that Walter Foster was the only man in that second lineup that was in the first lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.069" offset="14351653">And as I say, there could not been anymore suggested situation than that presented by the prosecution at that second lineup.</text>

            <text syncTime="3571.368" offset="14388851">Mr. Maddy, before you sit down I would just like to say to you that the Court appreciates your representation of this indigent defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.230" offset="14428244">You're appointed by this Court to represent him and we believe that such representation is a public service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.872" offset="14466905">And we had to come for that in effect that lawyers are willing to assume that in the interest of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.983" offset="14495326">So, we thank you and Ms. Maier, we thank you for the diligent manner in which you have represented the interest of your state.</text>
