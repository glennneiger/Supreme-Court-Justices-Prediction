            <label>Mr. Gorge C. Pontikes</label>
            <text syncTime="22.037" offset="191509">Good morning Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.558" offset="209586">This matter comes before the Court on the writ of certiorari to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals which a firm a judgment on conviction for willfully and knowingly failing and neglecting to report for induction in violation of Section 462, Title 50 appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.656" offset="290043">The court below found that that is the trial court found the petitioner could not raise a defense of valid or invalid reclassification because he had exhausted his administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.612" offset="357857">This position was affirmed by the Sixth Court of Appeals and when the writ of certiorari was granted as petitioner understood it there were two questions to be present before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.268" offset="408430">One was, whether or not the petitioner was required to exhaust his administrative remedies under the circumstances and the other is whether or not the interpretation of Section 456 (o) of Title 50 appendix namely the sole surviving exemption provision whether that the interpretation of that provision by selected service was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.282" offset="512502">The facts in this case really are simple and are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.670" offset="534026">The petitioner was born February 13, 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.701" offset="554193">He was first classified by local board Number 9 of public county 1 (a) on February 26, 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.947" offset="591182">He was ordered for a pre-induction physical examination on March 23, 1964, the examination that take place April 21, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.856" offset="630784">He did not respond to that examination or didn't show up.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.398" offset="644995">He was then classified as a delinquent by his local board and on May 1, 1964 they ordered him to report for induction on May 11, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.242" offset="688358">On May 10th, he wrote a letter to the board indicating that he disagreed the whole concept of Selective Service and at that point the board replied and asked him whether he wanted to apply his conscientious objector.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.884" offset="742902">In later, communications he indicated that he did not -- the board has also inquired as to why he checked the box on his original classification questionnaire indicating that he was a sole surviving son.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.757" offset="790444">There was some additional correspondence that came to light that his father had died as a navigator in the Air Force during World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.199" offset="820120">Thereupon, on July 27, 1967 -- the four, pardon me, he was classified 4 (a) by his local board.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.697" offset="850108">That classification remained in effect until February 14 of 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.389" offset="872887">Now, on January 30, 1966, local board number 9 came to the information that Jack McKart's mother had died, petitioner's mother had died.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.044" offset="915519">That left McKart without a “family unit” meaning that he had no sisters and both his parents were now deceased.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.532" offset="949478">Now, on basis of that information, the local board contacted the state director for selected service of Ohio who determined that because there was no “family unit” the petitioner was no longer eligible for the sole surviving son exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.166" offset="1020008">Therefore, he was reclassified on February 14, 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.090" offset="1039757">On February 24, 1966, he was ordered for another pre-induction physical examination on March 17, 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.246" offset="1068387">He did not respond and he wrote and told the board he would not respond.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.159" offset="1083956">Thereupon, he was again classified as a delinquent and as a delinquent on March 31, 1966 he was ordered to report for induction on April 21, 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.485" offset="1129305">The trial of this matter was held on May 16, 1967 where he was convicted by the lower court and given a sentence of three years in the custody of the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.893" offset="1166921">Now, Your Honors before we proceed into the -- I think question that is of main interest to the Court, I want to say first of all, we as petitioners understood that both the question of the exhaustion of the administrative remedies and the question of the correct interpretation of 456 is before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.943" offset="1259186">The respondent, United States of America has chosen not to brief the question of whether or not Selective Service's interpretation of Section 456 is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.471" offset="1301295">They have not argued that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.482" offset="1309341">We would therefore maintain that they have in effect conceded our position that I will allow them to speak for themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.751" offset="1334418">Therefore, I will deal exclusively with the exhaustion question.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.192" offset="1356152">Further, I feel that this is a question of a major importance in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.261" offset="1376423">Let me start off by saying that a contrary --</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="320.498" offset="1385409">The Court of Appeals never reached the merits.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gorge C. Pontikes</label>
            <text syncTime="323.772" offset="1398471">They did not Your Honor and neither that the District Court because they felt that it was not necessary given the posture of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.127" offset="1435878">We would like to make clear that we are not asking this Court to overrule its finding or its position in United States versus Falbo or Estep versus the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.816" offset="1482585">The government -- the first part of the government's brief treats our positions if we are asking the Court to overrule Falbo and Estep and we are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.130" offset="1515917">Secondly, we do not think that the fact that the petitioner in this case was in the words of the government's brief deliberately and flagrantly avoiding Selective Service and refusing to have anything to do with Selective Service really has any bearing on the question of whether or not he had to exhaust his administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.943" offset="1591150">I think the question of whether or not he had to exhaust his administrative remedies is questioned to be decided entirely apart from his own particular attitudes toward Selective Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.564" offset="1637648">Now, then as to the exhaustion uestion I think first we have to take up the question of whether or not the petitioner had to appeal his original reclassification and on that question we would -- our position is as follows, first and foremost, if the classification or the reclassification on February 14, 1966 was based upon a completely erroneous interpretation of Section 456, we would maintain that this was an act beyond the jurisdiction of local board number 9 and on that basis as has been often said in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.771" offset="1802428">There is no need to exhaust; this is an act beyond jurisdiction of the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.016" offset="1823431">It is an act totally prohibited by the statute and on that basis we would maintain first of all that there was no need for him to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.759" offset="1858435">Secondly and concomitantly, we would say that this was a pure question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.383" offset="1884871">That is to say the local boards both local boards and the state appeal boards are not competent to make legal judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.143" offset="1927920">I believe as recently as the case of Oestereich versus Selective Service system number 46 in this Court, Justice Harlan very properly and very incisively pointed out that the nature of Selective Service boards are such that they are not equipped to deal with judicial questions.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="476.539" offset="2009527">What about the appellate process within the system?</text>

          <turn speaker="gorge_c_pontikes" startTime="479.522" stopTime="543.406">
            <label>Mr. Gorge C. Pontikes</label>
            <text syncTime="479.522" offset="2021439">I believe Justice White that you will find that the appeal boards are made up of the same types of persons as the local boards are made up of.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.231" offset="2052263">In other words, if you take local boards, then the state appeal boards and finally the national Selective Service board which is made up of three members.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.008" offset="2087372">All three boards do not have persons who have any judicial competence.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.528" offset="2113494">They are not equipped to give render any kind of judicial decisions whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.782" offset="2142542">These are persons who are uncompensated, they hold no formal hearings, they require no legal briefs as again as Justice Harlan pointed out in his concurring opinion in Oestereich that no lawyers are allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.569" offset="2201684">In fact, they are specifically prohibited by Selective Service regulation to appear before the local boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.244" offset="2228328">On this basis, we would maintain that this boards both cannot in fact make any judicial decisions and furthermore because they cannot they generally do not and follow --</text>

            <text syncTime="551.147" offset="2307950">That is a judicial function, I would agree and perhaps the word “judicial” is a little bit too broad for our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.467" offset="2333236">I would say they are not qualified to make interpretations of law, statutory constructions or constitutional decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.725" offset="2370226">I would say that those are the types of judicial functions that they are not competent to engage --</text>

            <text syncTime="572.695" offset="2394154">What makes these boards -- the presidential boards for example different from them from an ordinary administrative agency?</text>
            <text syncTime="581.458" offset="2429158">I suppose in ordinary administrative agency you would say that the agency might, should have first shot at the -- even a pure question of interpretation of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="591.634" offset="2469909">Oh, I would say so Your Honor but I think there, you have an entirely different apparatus.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.620" offset="2489866">You have for example an adversary process which you do not have in Selective Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.444" offset="2513168">The Selective Service system is not intended to be an adversary process and the reason is not intended to be an adversary process is because it is geared to mobilize manpower in a short period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.051" offset="2563532">So, it is not, it's simply is not equipped on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.034" offset="2579519">Secondly, as part of the adversary process, you have lawyers appearing for both parties before administrative -- for a number of parties before an administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.805" offset="2618598">You don't have that in Selective Service.</text>

            <text syncTime="644.659" offset="2682023">Well, I would say that the -- what we are saying is that the act, the decision on their part to reclassify in February 14, 1966 was an act beyond their jurisdiction because we contend that the petitioner was entitled to his sole surviving son exemption even though his mother had died.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.991" offset="2783378">Our contention is to the statutory construction question Justice Harlan is that that was a completely erroneous interpretation of the law and therefore that reclassification was an act beyond their jurisdiction, that's our position.</text>

            <text syncTime="774.229" offset="3200293">The Selective Service law says that the decisions of the boards of Selective Service shall be final and that was the law up until July 1 of 1967 at which time was added the now Section 10 (b) (3) which this Court had occasion to construe recently where it said that there will be no review until there has been either -- there's going to response to an order to report for induction either affirmatively or negatively and then only the review will only encompass the question whether the board had jurisdiction as a matter of basis and fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="846.820" offset="3490670">I do feel that in Falbo the primary motivation of the Court and a primary thinking of the Court was based upon its conception of the reason for Selective Service and theory being that because there was a mobilization that this was a system to mobilize manpower that was necessary that you require an exhaustion and further that you require a completion of the administrative process before there could be a defense raise in a criminal prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="934.640" offset="3841964">The local board had adopted these positions and for the petitioner to be required under these circumstances to engage in these appeals would have been pure futility.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.176" offset="3900061">The Government makes or attempts to make the argument that the state appeal board does have the duty under the requisite regulations and statutes to classify de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.806" offset="3946559">Now, that is a theoretical duty, there's no question about that but I would say as we said in our reply brief that would be a departure from reality for the Government to contend that as a practical matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.664" offset="3993997">This occurs when the issue is one of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.704" offset="4014164">If for the issue were one of a factual determination, there might be grounds for disagreement between the national director and the appellate processes but where the local board or the state appeal board or even the national appeal board is faced with a question of pure statutory construction was this case involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.790" offset="4082500">Then there's no question in my mind that in 99 out of a hundred cases they will follow the national director.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.791" offset="4106533">As a matter of fact, this was recognized by the Court in Sicurella versus the United States where a state appeal board had before it a determination not by the national director but by the justice department in its conscientious objector section, an opinion that Sicurella was not a conscientious objector because he was not opposed to theocratic war.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.385" offset="4196916">And at that time, the Court found that this was an error of law in the determination by the justice department and then concluded that the appeal board probably followed this recommendation because there was an authoritative source and thereby reversed the conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1199.729" offset="4902327">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.009" offset="4903372">That's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.777" offset="4906506">But the fact decision is a different matter as we have pointed out and that's really our -- the point at which this case is distinguished from the Falbo and Estep kind of rational, the doctrines embodied in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.198" offset="4960214">In those cases, both of them, the boards had to determine whether or not a person was a minister and this is essentially a factual determination to be made upon the evidence presented by the individual registrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.760" offset="5018415">Here, in the case of McKart, the matter is one of strictly one of the interpretation of Section 456 namely, was McKart to be deprived of his 4 (a) exemption because he had no family unit left and we would maintain that where that is the issue and where the agency in this case Selective Service had already made up its mind that McKart was not entitled to the exemption that for him to be required to go through the appeal's process would've been a complete futility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.947" offset="5175150">Now, we go to the other aspect of the Government's position which is that independent of McKart having failed to exhaust his administrative remedies he ought at least to have been required to take physical examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.206" offset="5236172">Now, as to that I call this Court's attention respectfully to its recent decision in Oestereich versus the Selective Service System where in a case very similar to this one the Court did not require Oestereich to take a physical examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.351" offset="5300746">If the Court will read the record carefully in the Oestereich decision you will see that there Oestereich was not told that before he could obtain his remedy by way of civil relief that he was required to go in and either fail or pass a physical examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.697" offset="5366157">Now, as a matter of fact as far as we can determine and I've read, checked the appendix in Oestereich, I may able to read the complete record but as far as I can determine in the Oestereich decision Oestereich never did take physical examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.990" offset="5419342">And I would say that if Oestereich is not required to take a physical examination as a precondition for giving him civil relief then certainly I do not think that Jack McKart ought to be required to take a physical examination where it would otherwise be futile for him to exhaust his administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.980" offset="5499277">And that's the case we had here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.445" offset="5513174">Secondly, I think the requirement in Selective Service law that a physical examination be taken loses its force in this kind of case, I think it has great force in the cases involving men like Falbo and Estep where there are essentially factual determinations to be made by the boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.729" offset="5590288">There, I think the Court in the interest of maintaining the speed and mobility of Selective Service and in the interest of not flooding the courts with litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.959" offset="5631248">There, there is good reason for this Court to require the taking of physical examination but in the case like McKart's where the issue is one of statutory interpretation I think there is a greater interest in having this Court determined the correct interpretation of the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.602" offset="5701778">We're dealing here with the interpretation of federal law and I would say that there's a greater interest in having this Court determine the correct interpretation of the federal law and also the fact because these cases will occur less often.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.151" offset="5756008">And there is less danger having the flood gates of litigation opened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.231" offset="5780250">I would say finally on connection with this point that is as we pointed out in our brief an irony that Jack McKart should be ordered for a physical examination on the basis of a reclassification that we consider faintly invalid because without that reclassification under the existing Selective Service regulations he could not be required to take a physical examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.895" offset="5878993">He was not 1 (a) and he was not shortly to be inducted which are the only two grounds upon which a physical examination can be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.245" offset="5912325">So, on that basis it would strike us as being the most anomalous situation that he ought to be barred from raising the statutory -- the incorrect statutory interpretation by the fact that he did not take a physical examination which in itself could not have been required had the reclassification not been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.550" offset="5997589">I want to reserve some time for rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.832" offset="6006680">Thank you for your kind attention.</text>

            <text syncTime="1486.272" offset="6048475">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.214" offset="6068224">At the outset, petitioner's argument strikes us as a somewhat curious one because he wants us to assume as I understand it that a question of statutory construction either has been or will be or should be necessarily decided in his favor and then he builds upon that assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.172" offset="6156100">I should state that as we pointed out in our brief, footnote 10 of the Government's brief, it was not out intention to concede as petitioner suggested anything regarding the construction of the sole surviving son exemption rather as we pointed out neither the courts below reached this issue and it seems to us that in light of that fact and in light of the fact that it is a question of first impression on which no other court has passed that it's not an appropriate issue that petitioner can ascertain raise here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.214" offset="6320253">Both of the courts below as petitioner has noted found it unnecessary to reach that issue because they decided the case on exhaustion question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.874" offset="6382843">I think that it's apparent despite petitioner's strenuous efforts to avoid it that what he really seeks here is an overruling of Falbo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.560" offset="6437595">He says that's not what he wants that he has points in his case that are distinguishable from the situation involved in Falbo and Estep and that therefore the Court doesn't have to reach the question of whether the Falbo doctrine is still good law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.715" offset="6510216">Well, it seems does that at the outset that the grounds of petitioner seeks as making his case a peculiar or unique one or readily answer, these grounds as we understand it are two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.072" offset="6579702">One is that the question involved here as a matter of law or statutory interpretation and that the agencies of the Selective Service System as I take it from the local board through the state appeal board all the way up to the national appeal board are either incompetent, unqualified or for some other reason unable to pass on such question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.108" offset="6695790">Well, it seems to us this is simply not reflective of the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.899" offset="6722957">Question was raised about whether there are any lawyers on Selective Service appeal boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.576" offset="6749706">The answer to that is that the regulations themselves require that one member of each state appeal board be a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.889" offset="6778964">And as a matter or fact as to the national appeal board, the chairman himself is a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.332" offset="6800697">He's a probate judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.165" offset="6816057">Moreover, it's a little bit difficult to understand how you can say that certain issues are simply matters of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.918" offset="6867048">Every question of classification involves questions of law what the boards are seeking to do is to pursuant to the regulations in the statute as they interpret and construe them, give each registrant the appropriate classifications that Congress has determined that he should have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.205" offset="6952208">They worked against the background and in the framework of the Selective Service Act in the pertinent regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.051" offset="6979584">There's no other way that they can operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.318" offset="6992645">Insofar as the statute itself is concern, it is silent on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.412" offset="7016991">It says that local boards shall have the power with their respect to jurisdictions to hear and determine subject to the right of appeal to the appeal boards here unauthorized all questions or claims with respect to the inclusion for or exemption or deferment from training and service of all individuals within the jurisdiction of these boards and the similar provisions that relate to the de novo a classification by the appeal board and the national board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.047" offset="7167561">So, it seems to us that for several reasons petitioner is not on sound ground when he suggests that matters of law are wholly without the competence of these boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.391" offset="7224926">As a matter of fact, this Court in Cox versus United States in 332 U.S. noted that questions of classification are matters of the law for the courts decide not for the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.971" offset="7287306">It seems to us that it's logical to conclude from that that when these local boards and state appeal board, the national board of passing on these questions that necessarily they're involved in legal issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.791" offset="7350523">I realize that there's a continuum that exists here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.791" offset="7370585">Some questions are more peculiarly factual in nature and some questions more appropriately legal in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.893" offset="7398902">Now, what I'm seeking to point out is that as a local board faces a question of classification it has to face that issue against the backdrop of the Selective Service Act in a pertinent regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.255" offset="7456371">Those are laws insofar as I know and can determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.418" offset="7477060">And therefore to say that they can't -- that they had no confidence to pass on these matters, it seems to me is simply wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.977" offset="7535261">Petitioner also suggest that -- well, on that point as was noted by Mr. Justice White in conclusion on that point of passing on statutory -- question of statutory interpretation or law, it does seem to us that it's not an appropriate here to give the administrative agency charged with the administration of this act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.220" offset="7644244">A first opportunity to pass on an important statutory question, petitioner can see as this question is one of first impression, the act was amended in 1964 as a great dearth of authority on the whole meaning of the sole surviving son exemption.</text>

            <text syncTime="1952.846" offset="7914768">We -- in order we see anything in the cases that indicates any distinction in this regard and we submit that therefore it's not inappropriate that the Falbo doctrine be construed to require that on all matters of classification, the administrative agencies and the administrative process be given an opportunity to consider these questions in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.829" offset="8030647">They weren't given this opportunity here, petitioner's position are simply that he didn't want anything to do with the Selective Service System.</text>

            <text syncTime="2113.141" offset="8555917">The other aspect of petitioner's position that there's no need to reach the validity of the Falbo doctrine here is that it would've been futile in any event to pursue his administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.897" offset="8626970">Well, we think that that's simply not accurate on the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.364" offset="8648808">The administrative remedies that were available to him were in the first instance an appeal to the state appeal board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.229" offset="8680260">And further, from that decision an appeal to the national appeal board if one, the state appeal board had been divided or two, even had it not been divided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.551" offset="8733550">He could have asked the national or the state director to take the case to the national board upon his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.721" offset="8758209">As the Court may recall this is a situation that existed in Clay case and there has been a consistent position taken by the national and state directors that questions of importance in the system will be taken to the national board on behalf of registrant even though they don't have appeals as right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.584" offset="8833755">It seems to us that it would've been futile here for petitioner to seek to exhaust his administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.140" offset="8879940">He refers to the fact that advice was given by the national director and the state director to his local board in response to an inquiry to the effect that the pertinent section of the Act Section 6 (o) should be construed as not allowing his statutory exemption under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.895" offset="8982967">Well, that's true but it's also true that the national director and the state director are different people and the state appeal board and certainly for the national appeal board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.602" offset="9029778">It's clear by statute that the national appeal board is an independent body responsible only to the president and exercising the powers given at the president under the Act as his direct delegate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.458" offset="9085158">It's not responsible to the Selective Service System or to the director in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.189" offset="9116087">The state appeal board similarly are not required to follow a bulletin's advice whatever given by the national director or the state director.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.848" offset="9154748">They are required under the law to consider de novo of propriety of an individual's classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.878" offset="9190902">So, it seems to us that the fact that in form of advice was given by the national director and the state director on this matter is not convincing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.125" offset="9243878">There's one other aspect that petitioner seeks to rely upon the national director promulgated an operations bulletin in August of 1964 shortly after the enactment of the amendment which included for the first time fathers within the category of those persons whose death may trigger the sole surviving son exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.953" offset="9347218">And that operations bulletin essentially took the position the petitioner here argues as to the substantive issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2558.774" offset="10338513">Now, we recognize that if Falbo was overruled, each and every registrant is not going to simply defy the system as petitioner did here and wait until he's prosecuted criminally in order to raise whatever a claims he has as to the validity of his classification but there will be some incentive in that regard provided and in a time of national emergency, in a time of war, it seems to us that if Falbo is overruled there's some real hazards presented to the effective operation of the system.</text>

            <text syncTime="2800.355" offset="11304835">It seems to us that the Court in Oestereich was simply construing the intendment of Congress regarding provisions that were and apparently in some conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.989" offset="11371290">In Gabriel, the Court made clear that the general preclusion on preinduction review was applicable that there are only certain exceptions that would be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.917" offset="11423013">We recognized that there are certain limited exemptions that have been noted over the years to the exhaustion doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.433" offset="11457076">Petitioner refers to a variety of these and of the cases in which they have been considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.395" offset="11496991">And I'd like just to refer quickly to what these are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.486" offset="11513292">One notion is that you don't have to exhaust when it's simply infeasible or impracticable to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.558" offset="11537638">One individual in the Donato case was off on fire fighting duty during the period in time and which he had to take his administrative appeal and the Court there said it should be excused because it just wasn't possible that the practicable for him to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.909" offset="11614960">Another relates to a serious procedural irregularity within the system itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.918" offset="11638993">In the Will's case, the petitioner refers to a some link as we read it that's the basic ground on which the Court of Appeals said that it could excuse exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.772" offset="11682461">In the Will's case and the notice of delinquency was not sent to the registrant of the appropriate time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.521" offset="11709419">And therefore, he was in a disadvantage situation with respect to his classification because he wasn't apprise in the timely fashion that sort of procedural or irregularity has been also allowed to excuse the exhaustion of administrative remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.023" offset="11783502">In the Wolf case, the Court of Appeals, the Second Circuit discussed at some length the Falbo doctrine, the exhaustion of remedies doctrine and the Selective Service context found it inapplicable where First Amendment issues were a series of First Amendment questions were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.139" offset="11855914">That involved and attempted delinquency reclassification of registrants for sitting in a draft board in Arbor Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.764" offset="11886425">And the Court there found that the questions they raised under the First Amendment were comprehended under this Court's doctrine of -- in Dombrowski versus Pfister and therefore an appropriate exception to the exhaustion rule could be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.300" offset="11952567">The -- another exception that's been noted has to do with whether the individual is aware of his administrative remedies as will be developed at greater length in the subsequent case to Burney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.438" offset="12009096">The procedure that's established here is one that seeks to make registrants amply aware of what rights they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.766" offset="12050474">The Selective Service classification certificate itself has we have reprinted in the appendix pages 62 and 63 sets out all the detail procedures that need to be taken and the time within which these procedures need to be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.617" offset="12117870">I should note that subsequent to the operative facts in this case the pertinent regulations have been amended so that now the registrant has 30 days instead of 10 days within which to take an appeal to the state appeal board the feeling being that some of these cases relating to exceptional circumstances had perhaps resulted because of the short period of time that had previously been given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.219" offset="12240227">We make a separate point of his failure to report for preinduction physicals as I noted that is a precise aspect of the Falbo holding itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.711" offset="12290173">Falbo of course was clarified and confirmed in Estep those cases bracketed together stand for the exhaustion doctrine that we here rely upon and the courts below relied upon but it seems to us that it is a somewhat separate in different thing is the Court of Appeals in the Iron's case recently noted as we pointed out in our brief large numbers of registrants are unfortunately found not to be physically fit when they take a physical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.662" offset="12410023">Had petitioner taken a physical, we have no way of knowing what is physical condition is but he may well have been found not to be physically fit and therefore they would have been no occasion to reach any of their question that is now seeks to present.</text>

            <text syncTime="3124.684" offset="12602075">I think it's important that as Justice Stewart pointed out subsequent to shortly after Falbo the system was changed so that preinduction physicals are now required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.604" offset="12649827">The purpose of that is so that each board will know ahead of time what individuals it has available physically qualified individuals available to meet each monthly call as it occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.684" offset="12698102">So, it seems to us that it is an important aspect to the system otherwise the board has no way of knowing what this individual's situation or status is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.877" offset="12742928">And so therefore, we think that there's an independent ground here as petitioner notes he wasn't charged with failure to report for physical exam.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.584" offset="12785664">And we realize that but in the context of the applicability of the exhaustion doctrine our point simply is that this is another aspect that we think should be taken into account.</text>

            <text syncTime="3203.452" offset="12917217">It seems to me that there are at least two principal disadvantages that would result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.601" offset="12937801">One, operation of the Selective Service System itself would be subject to serious disruption because individuals would not be required to pursue remedies through the system as elaborate machinery that Congress in the present have established to consider and pass upon claims to classification would -- could be deliberately and effectively bypass.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.187" offset="13032155">Indeed, that's what petitioner sought to do here we think simply deliberately bypass this whole system.</text>

            <text syncTime="3240.723" offset="13066219">It seems to us it could well create very serious delays and disruptions because there would be no way of knowing if individuals did not pursue their administrative remedies and if individuals did not report for preinduction physicals, no way of knowing from month to month.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.590" offset="13145736">Those individuals that were available that the system is set up not to put people in jail and to prosecute them but for violations of the act but to properly classify and induct them into the service and it seems to us that the whole administrative machinery is directed toward that purpose insuring a proper classification and insuring that there is a steady continuous flow of manpower when needed for the armed services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.946" offset="13271124">And it seems to us that if the exhaustion doctrine is abandoned that will be interfered way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.900" offset="13306964">The other aspect it seems to us of this is simply that when the administrative agencies are bypassed the load of litigation in the courts is commensurately will increased and the courts are going to be forced to pass on these questions without any gloss of administrative interpretation or construction and without screening and reading out of cases that would be taken care of through following the administrative process.</text>

            <text syncTime="3522.393" offset="14192933">It seems to us fundamental that there is a crucial distinction to be drawn between the Falbo-Estep situation where a local board makes certain factual determinations comes to conclusion and then there is a requirement that there will be an exhaustion and the taking away physical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.625" offset="14285824">Now, in that particular case, you do not have a pure statutory question of pure statutory construction that you have in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3563.948" offset="14359176">Further, as the courts have recognized where an administrative process or the taking of administrative appeals would be futile then the aggrieved party is not required to take those administrative processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.534" offset="14421556">Now, for the Government to tell us here that the state appeal board is going to operate independently of the directions of the national director is really to find the face of reality.</text>

            <text syncTime="3677.037" offset="14811512">The split decision is a decision where there's a dissent on state appeal board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.156" offset="14828022">This is in the first six months of 1968.</text>

            <text syncTime="3691.689" offset="14870131">So, if you take those two figures and put them together you'll get an idea of how possible it is first of all for this case ever to have reached the national appeal board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.001" offset="14903359">Secondly, even though the cases indicates some disagreement with the national state director, there's no showing that the cases decided by the national board were decided on questions of legal interpretation of the statute.</text>
