            <label>Mr. Victor Rabinowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="26.417" offset="209063">-- and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.685" offset="226095">This is an appeal from a judgment of a three-judge court sitting on the Southern District of New York denying to the plaintiffs an injunction and declaratory judgment against the district attorney of Queens County and the Attorney General for the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.138" offset="295894">The plaintiffs seek to enjoin their prosecution under the New York State Criminal Anarchy Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.654" offset="325987">The eleven defendants and five others -- the eleven plaintiffs, excuse me, and five others were indicted on charges of (1) advocacy of criminal anarchy, (2) conspiracy to commit advocacy of criminal anarchy and in the case of one of the plaintiffs permitting his premises to be used for assemblages of anarchists.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.080" offset="431731">The indictment contained altogether 48 counts of which only six are under consideration here.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.790" offset="466526">The other 42 counts related to offenses such the illegal possession of guns and the illegal possession of explosives and weapons and the conspiracy to commit arsony -- arson and the -- a whole series of other conventional crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.516" offset="537475">We are concerned here and we attack here only that much of the indictment as relates to the New York criminal anarchy law.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.512" offset="581465">Now, that law as this Court will recall was passed in 1902 and was applied once in 1921 in the Gitlow case.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.627" offset="617932">Was not used again until 1964 when it was used to convict Mr. Epton.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.029" offset="651473">The indictment was handed down here a month after the New York Court of Appeals decision in Epton.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.748" offset="678327">And it raised fears in the minds of not only the plaintiffs but many others who are entrusted in civil liberties issues of a widespread use of state sedition statutes which had long been considered nor bound but which had effectively stifled radical thought in the 20's and like the Federal Act in the 50's.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.345" offset="780727">In addition to the possession of guns and the conspiracy to commit arson and the other as -- but I prefer to as conventional crimes, two of the plaintiffs in this case were charged in a simultaneous indictment with conspiracy to commit murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.541" offset="837569">They were convicted in that case as pending here on a writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.966" offset="859199">I mention this merely to indicate that to stress the point, to emphasize the point that there on the books of New York of course many statutes including those that are charged in this case to protect public order and to take care of people who collect guns in order to seek to overthrow the government or for any other purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.103" offset="955747">There are three principal points raised by the appellants here.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.916" offset="975078">The first is that the New York criminal anarchy law on its face and as applied in this case violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution both with respect to freedom of press, speech and assembly and also with respect to due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.893" offset="1054908">Second, that the New York statute with respect to the selection of grand jurors has a monetary or had at that time a monetary qualification before he serves as a grand juror and that therefore the grand jury which indicted these defendants was illegally convened and finally that the Federal Government through the Smith Act has preempted the field of sedition including sedition against the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.009" offset="1167444">I shall argue only the first of these points here today and I'm not abandoning the other points.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.563" offset="1189595">I think they're good.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.932" offset="1195133">Or we're relying on them but they have been briefed and I know that those issues are not central to the concern of the Court here today and I shall just rely on my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.467" offset="1241213">We are limited as the Court, this of course with the -- by time limitations and I would prefer to use that time to address myself to the subject which I know concerns the Court most.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.378" offset="1288861">The first aspect, however, the New York criminal anarchy law and its unconstitutionality is of course a critical matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.787" offset="1326477">And this aspect of the case has also in its turn I think three aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.684" offset="1370154">The first is whether Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 is an exception to 2283 of the judicial -- judiciary code and I think that that issue must be met head on.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.436" offset="1433161">The second is assuming that we can meet that -- cross that threshold, whether the Court should nevertheless abstain and I think that issue has to be met head on.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.008" offset="1491362">And finally, we get I hope to the merits of the case namely whether the Act on its face and as applied in this situation is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.309" offset="1548622">Now, the first question of the interrelation of 1983 of the Act of 1871 and the Section 2283 of the Act of 1789 I guess it is, is a matter which of course has been discussed almost endlessly.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.365" offset="1624795">It's hard to think of any question within the general area of procedural rights in a -- in the federal -- with respect to federal jurisdiction over criminal cases that has caused quite as much judicial and law review discussion in the last two or three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.143" offset="1707969">The issue was faced by the three-judge court in Cameron against Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.373" offset="1728867">It was argued in brief in that case in this Court but this Court never reached the problem and sent it back to the District Court for decision on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.662" offset="1777977">We have collected the cases or tried to collect the cases that are not completely up-to-date in footnote 11, page 24 of our brief on re-argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.890" offset="1822908">Since then other cases have been called to our attention including Sheridan against Garrison and Machesky against Bizzell both in the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.431" offset="1865122">There have been extensive law review articles on the subject, 21 wrote this law review, an unsigned article and an article in 113 University of Pennsylvania Law Review signed I think by Professor Amsterdam.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.775" offset="1930428">Whatever I say here is -- I fear going to be an echo of those law review articles and those court decisions which have decided this case in my favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.219" offset="1980270">It is our contention that Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 was intended by Congress as an exception to 2283 of the judiciary code.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.787" offset="2038471">Mr. Mackell in his brief points out that 2283 was enacted at a time in our history when the rights of the states were of primary concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.989" offset="2087372">That is quite true but 1983 was passed at a time in our history when Congress was primarily concerned with protecting the individual from injustices which they feared would be perpetrated upon them by the state courts as a result of the antagonisms, the tensions, the problems that had arisen out of the Civil War.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.895" offset="2194996">It was passed by the reconstruction congresses and to say that those congresses did not intend to interfere with.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.704" offset="2238151">Yes, to interfere with state prosecution in certain kinds of cases runs directly contrary to the legislative history of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.688" offset="2282141">It has been argued by the appellants here, by the appellees here and by persons in other cases that our interpretation of 1983 will impede the state courts in the normal operation of the criminal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.357" offset="2356851">It will and that is exactly what was intended by Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.137" offset="2391960">And the legislative history makes it clear, not in all cases but in certain kinds of cases, cases coming within Section 1983 that it was the intent of Congress to protect persons whose rights were being interfered with by state officials including state courts to protect them by giving them resort to a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.401" offset="2500942">And I cannot see how it is possible to read the legislative history all of which is set forth in the Watkins Law Review Article at a considerable length.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.420" offset="2541066">And some of which is referred to also by Professor Amsterdam in his University of Pennsylvania Law Review Article, I do not see how and I could quote Professor Amsterdam, “It is impossible to read the debates without concluding that the federal legislatures were intensely aware of the hostility and antiunion” meaning, northern not trade union, “prejudice of the southern state courts and the use of state court proceedings to harass those whom the union had an obligation to protect.”</text>
            <text syncTime="642.491" offset="2673351">That is the law that we are talking about today.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.208" offset="2684217">It's Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.757" offset="2706369">And to say that Congress intended that a person who is being improperly prosecuted, who is being harassed, whose rights are being taken away from him by a state official may not apply to a federal court for assistance under Section 1983 is to fly in the face of the direct intent of Congress in passing that law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1483.403" offset="6036982">Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.295" offset="6048580">My client in this case is Fred Fernandez.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.965" offset="6059238">He is one of the 15 subject to the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.046" offset="6079509">And I want to commence my argument sort of taking going on from Mr. Rabinowitz's argument, on the theory that the issue of 2283 and 1983 I think can well be answered as Mr. Rabinowitz answered it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.281" offset="6156518">But I'm not sure that that's an adequate answer because after one says, “Yes, there is the power to enjoin.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.981" offset="6191313">It's obviously not a principle which is promotive of peace in the states to have the federal courts interfering whenever there is a claim of unfairness below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.843" offset="6258709">And so I have called over some of the opinions of this Court and some of the writings of the American Law Institute with regard to their consideration of this subject and it seems to me that we can set up four reasons or four considerations which all obtained in this case which would persuade a court not to abstain from a decision with regard to a constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.569" offset="6401651">The general premise being that a federal court will abstain and permit a state court to decide the issues of constitutionality where they are raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.580" offset="6449716">Now, the first consideration has to do with the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.073" offset="6471659">And generally speaking this Court has been more sensitive to issues of First Amendment particularly when they arise in the states and for a number of reasons, in order to create the uniformity of law in the United States and in order to protect the First Amendment which sometimes in the heat of whatever -- of the battle below state jurisdictions are not as sensitive to the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.332" offset="6596733">Now that -- I'm going to mention this four factors and then go back over them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.554" offset="6625573">The second one ties in to the First Amendment and it has to do with -- when the issue involving the First Amendment has to do with the public business and I'm referring to the language used by Mr. Justice White when -- in the Red Lion case when he referred to the kind of -- the kind of public business that Alexander Meiklejohn talks about when he's talking about the FirstAmendment, talking about the right of people, to hear arguments, and the right of people to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.162" offset="6744064">And when in you're in the area of sedition, you are in the area of the public business because you're talking about Government and some people's ideas about what's wrong with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.415" offset="6788995">Then the third factor has to do with -- and it's a very important question and that is can the constitutional issue even though it involves the First Amendment, even though it involves the public business, can it be solved by the state route?</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.158" offset="6848031">Is the issue something that the state court has not yet had an opportunity to rule on?</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.625" offset="6869870">Perhaps there is even an independent state ground as in the recent case that had to do with Alaskan fishing rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.050" offset="6907591">Your -- this Court abstained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.406" offset="6916995">Mr. Justice Douglas wrote the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.524" offset="6925458">This Court abstained because there might even have been a decision there based upon the Alaska Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.567" offset="6957641">So, that even though they were important issues, it's not appropriate for this Court to interfere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.464" offset="6985226">Then there's a fourth ground which is that the prosecution itself is unfair and discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.500" offset="7021380">And perhaps a law which is not ordinarily invoked against the defendant is used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.058" offset="7043636">And that is a fourth basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.621" offset="7053876">And that fourth basis was mentioned in the AL, the American Law Institute series of reasons given when they decide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.359" offset="7100792">Of course, they are not the Supreme Court but there are number of judges sitting on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.139" offset="7115943">They decided that 1983 or there is an exception or there should be an exception in the law to the absolute caveat against the federal court issuing an injunction against the state court prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1777.244" offset="7212387">I believe that there is a whole line of opinion that shows that -- well, as to other instances where it's not written in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.764" offset="7250422">Certainly the way 1983 is phrased which gives a litigant a right to relief equitable or otherwise would suggest the -- it is an expressed exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.229" offset="7316250">Now, in all of these considerations, I think we started out with the fact that we are talking about equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.385" offset="7340910">So if any of these considerations do not obtain or are not persuasive, then it is something that should be perhaps sent back to the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.425" offset="7381034">But in -- Mr. Justice Marshall mentioned removal as though that might be an adequate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.741" offset="7410291">May I say that's a very narrow remedy and although originally it may have been intended to overlap 1983, I think today a litigant would have a pretty hard time using it in one of these cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1885.243" offset="7644348">I couldn't say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.069" offset="7655633">But I don't think -- I don't want to make this an ad hominem argument, I think there are as compelling reasons today to be interested in the First Amendment and into -- in the considerations of fairness and the four considerations I mentioned as there were during the Civil War period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.912" offset="7727000">So, or -- and the -- and its aftermath.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.784" offset="7738493">Now, with regard to this application to the instant case, question was asked, was the Court of Appeals' opinion in Epton the narrowing interpretation -- is that narrowing interpretation constitutional?</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.982" offset="7803277">And I submit that its not for the reason that the highest court of the State of New York in trying to read in to the -- to 160 and 161 and presumably if that obtains, it would also be read into the new statute which supersedes 160 and 161 which had already been passed but which was not yet effective at the time the highest court of New York interpreted the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.872" offset="7934830">That highest court left out of its language, language which appears in Brandenburg, which has to do with the requirement for the validity of a sedition statute that the danger of overthrow or of lawless action be immanent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.675" offset="8018108">Now, that has been left out of the interpretation of the Epton's of -- in Epton and is left out of the statute -- the statute's interpretation and it also is missing from the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.159" offset="8079966">If you will read the indictment in this case, you will read that there is no -- there are no consideration of clear and present danger in the indictment and all you have is the allegation that these defendants with regard to the anarchy counts advocated the overthrow of the Government by force and violence with intent that it take place but not any allegation as to the likelihood of it taking place or any allegation and this is another consideration which comes out of Yates and Dennis and Brandenburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.052" offset="8251538">That the -- Brandenburg, not so much, that they -- that the group doing the advocacy of the overthrow of the Government be of sufficient size and strenth to actually present such a threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.568" offset="8313605">Now, Epton did one more thing although the court said in Epton, that's the Court of Appeals, that clear and present danger has to be read into the statute when it implied that doctrine to the -- to Epton.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.080" offset="8387688">What it really said was that the clear and present danger did not have to be clear in present danger of the overthrow of the Government of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.389" offset="8424887">All it had to be was clear and present danger that the riots then rocking Harlem continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.474" offset="8449233">And I submit that that's the meaning of Epton and looked at that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.322" offset="8472639">The State of New York has an unconstitutional statute which it is trying to apply to these defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.496" offset="8513390">Now, when I speak of the public business, I think it's very important that you know how this case fits into the public business, the -- what the -- we do allege in our complaint that this is a harassing action against these defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.280" offset="8604505">And in the harassing we mentioned and it's attached to the appelant's brief and also filed with the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.191" offset="8644106">We attach a number of newspaper stories, all of which were released by the district attorney at the time that these people were indicted and it's very clear from the language used in these press releases that the direction of this -- of the action is against the thoughts of these defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.696" offset="8746193">Now, quoting the district attorney on page 67 here in the press releases that appeared in the press, he said that Stokely Carmichael, a leading black power advocate had connections with RAM, that's the Revolutionary Action Movement which was dedicated to the overthrow of the capitalist system in the U.S. by violence if necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.161" offset="8840025">Now, parenthetically this is supposedly an anarchy or the attempt to overthrow the State of New York yet all of these press releases have to do with the overthrow of the Government of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.153" offset="8900002">Again, I read, Mackell said the arrested RAM members are followers of Chinese Premier Mao Tse Tung and are associated with another Negro organization called Black Americans Unite or Perish headed by Robert Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.311" offset="8956635">And again, their intent was to spur Negro militancy across the nation, police said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.707" offset="8978160">Following recent ghetto rioting in Atlanta, Tampa, Dayton, Cincinnati and Watts, and then finally, I think this really caps the First Amendment public business aspect of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.678" offset="9042108">In discussing the defendants, Mackell said that Fernandez who headed -- that's my client who headed a group of approximately 20 youths between the ages of fifth -- 16 to 21 may well have tried to influence them with revolutionary action movement philosophy and finally, Queens' District Attorney Thomas J. Mackell said that the 16 arrested on bearing charges were members of RAM, an anarchist group which federal authorities say is pro-communist China and pro-Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.628" offset="9173870">That wasn't the final one, I wanted to -- sorry, a bit of accumulativeness here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.398" offset="9200933">The police investigation into this matter dates back two years, Mackell declared.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.957" offset="9223189">I have had Assistant District Attorney Thomas DeMakos of Jackson Heights on the case ever since we were informed about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.346" offset="9256730">He and Lieutenant James Murphy of my squad had been working together on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.271" offset="9276479">DeMakos had to do a tremendous amount of reading and had to digest hundreds of thousands of words before we felt we were ready to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.059" offset="9323604">Now this, I say, goes to the heart of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.166" offset="9340008">This is an accusation against these defendants with regard to the anarchy charge that is squarely -- that is squarely violative of First Amendment considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.725" offset="9398314">Now, we cannot solve this case by the state rule because when it gets up to the State Court of Appeals, the State Court of Appeals is bound by its own decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.249" offset="9456410">And there's another problem, by the time this case is tried there are as you have heard 48 counts in this indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.556" offset="9493608">Only five of which involve my client.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.010" offset="9507401">Only four of which involve anarchy and the fifth involves conspiracy to commit arson in the third degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.955" offset="9543241">Now, by the time the jury has heard all of the -- all of the testimony with regard to anarchy, I predict that my client will be convicted of arson in the third degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.884" offset="9606875">This is of course a distinction from Dombrowski where the contention was made that the char -- criminal charges were brought against the defendants with no possibility of their being a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.722" offset="9662255">In this case, we say there is a strong possibility of a conviction and that the anarchy charges served to prejudice the case as a trial before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.113" offset="9707813">And in fact it is argued by the district attorney in his brief that he needs the anarchy charges in order to supply the factor of intent as to the illegal gun charges which he brings not against my client who is a casualty perhaps of the entire adventure but to attach intent to the gun charges against the other defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.933" offset="9819094">Now, the other aspect of what can happen is what exactly what did happen in Epton.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.453" offset="9841142">In Epton there was a conspiracy to riot charge that was attached to the anarchy charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.325" offset="9868622">And when he was convicted, the judge gave him a sentence which was concurrent with -- and it -- which covered the conspiracy to riot charge and was one year and therefore it never appeared what part the anarchy charges which I can assure you played a great part in the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.541" offset="9965484">It was never clear nor was it ever capable of being properly reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.163" offset="9988054">So you have a record where it will be impossible in this case for the defendants here, plaintiffs in the action in the federal court to secure a fair trial or absolution by the state method.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.170" offset="10084080">You have as I have indicated a discriminatory prosecution by a statute and I do think that it's important for the court to consider this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.492" offset="10125354">This is not a robbery statute, a -- that is invoked how many times throughout the United States today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.590" offset="10157746">This is not a burglary statute, this is a sedition statute and it's used in New York -- has only been three times at least in our recorded history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.993" offset="10207378">It's been used in Gitlow in 1920 and it was revived 6 -- 44 year late -- 44 years later in Epton.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.945" offset="10251160">And it was only upon the heels of the Court of Appeals' opinion in Epton which came down May 16th, 1967 that these indictments were brought in -- were brought against these 16 or 15 defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.423" offset="10337050">So it's clearly the -- a discriminatory prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.195" offset="10360142">Now, it seems to me that this is -- if there is -- is ever a case for the kind of relief which is available for federal intervention, this is it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.649" offset="10429942">There is a further argument that was made and I want to make it because I think it dramatizes the validity of the relief requested and that has to do with the grand jury point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.579" offset="10489710">Since this case was argued, this Court has come down with two decisions which suggested that the 250 property limitation might well be invalid but another -- in another decision you've said that the subjective standards which we claim here might be administered fairly so that the statute on its face would only be a little bit unconstitutional, when I say a little bit, advisedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.892" offset="10614888">I think that against the standards that I have just set up, the Strauss standards, that it's a challenge to a statute on the basis of the First Amendment, the grand jury statute wouldn't make that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.544" offset="10681553">That it's the public business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.846" offset="10686777">I don't think it would quite do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.341" offset="10696704">That it can't be solved by the state route.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.377" offset="10704854">Well, a year ago when I was before you, I told you it couldn't be solved by the state route be -- and I cited a lot of cases in my brief showing that the state had not considered this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.828" offset="10742680">But on the 22nd of April of this year, Chestnut against the People of the State of New York was argued in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.076" offset="10775698">And these issues were presented to the Court of Appeals not as to Queens County, as to New York County.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.274" offset="10808508">But accordingly we can say that as to the grand jury issue that is something which perhaps can be solved by the state route.</text>

            <text syncTime="2794.177" offset="11280071">My name is Ludwig, I'm the Chief Assistant District Attorney of Queens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.130" offset="11295848">This is the second time this case is being argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.150" offset="11303999">The first time on April 1st, you Mr. Chief Justice and Justice Douglas weren't on the bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.643" offset="11333987">I just like to say at the outset that the question of publicity in this case was brought to the attention of one of our best Supreme Court justices, Justice Shapiro in Queens and he in an exhaustive opinion which is appended to my brief went into all facets of the question and his conclusion was that by no stretch of the imagination could the District Attorney in this case be accused of issuing any inaccurate, unfair prejudicial statements regarding this matter and that any statement the District Attorney ever made or I ever made in connection with this case was proper, justified and something the public had right to know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.783" offset="11518516">Many of the quotations that were read by Mrs. Piel are not quotations of the District Attorney but of some newspaper reporter writing the story without quotations marks and I think in all candor this Court ought to know that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.404" offset="11577031">Now, the defendant in this case is the District Attorney of Queens, actually the defendant should be a grand jury of 22 people in Queens who saw fit to accuse these defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.918" offset="11627081">The District Attorney did not accuse them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.851" offset="11638784">They were accused by the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.550" offset="11645576">The District Attorney knew nothing of this investigation while it was going on for a year and a half or two years until approximately a month before the matter was produ -- presented to the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.115" offset="11691865">The evidence in this case was obtained by a -- an undercover police office who had infiltrated this group, became a part of it, in fact was a vice president of it and who gained enough information about what was happening to enable -- to present this case to the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.899" offset="11766993">Now, this indictment is a -- one that involves 15 defendants, 11 of them are appellants in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.684" offset="11802102">The other four did not appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.314" offset="11812655">The indictment contains 48 counts and deals with five crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.689" offset="11830105">It's a superseding inictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.355" offset="11836792">The first indictment was found on June 20th, 1967, the case was presented on June 20th, the foreman handed up the indictment that night.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.836" offset="11890709">It was a one day presentation in great confidence and secrecy before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.095" offset="11915786">The foreman handed it up on June 20th in -- and the defendants were arrested pursuant to arrest warrants and these weapons and arms and arsenal were seized pursuant to search warrants signed by a Supreme Court justice particularly describing what was to be seized the following morning, June 21st.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.335" offset="12008678">Now, two indictments were handed up by this grand jury as a result of the testimony and their testimony consists of a 151 pages and I offered it to the Court on two occasions, the first time I argued here a year ago and no action was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.241" offset="12080358">These minutes of the grand jury unlike Harris against Younger, the California and it cannot be printed in records and are not printed customarily in our state appellate courts, the judges asked the District Attorney to hand up a copy of the minutes because we have a very strict rule on indictments on the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.979" offset="12175339">The rule is that there must be proof beyond the reasonable doubt in the grand jury minutes that the defendants are guilty if unexplained.</text>

            <text syncTime="3176.707" offset="12810219">Now, in this indictment, we have a -- we could've had a 131 indictments here if we were proceeding strictly according to the common law which required a single crime and a single defendant for each indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.360" offset="12876779">But again, our Code of Criminal Procedure and those sections are set forth at page 8 and 9 of my brief on re-argument and also the original briefs, allows us to combine defendants and charges in one indictment provided we separately number each crime in account.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.955" offset="12959222">And that provision appears in Section 279 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the reason I make mention of it is this at this stage, because we have combined here, in one indictment, the indictment now before the Court, 15 defendants and 48 counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.540" offset="13029543">We could've had 111 different indictments and then moved to consolidate them on the grounds that would come in issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.335" offset="13056711">The test for putting these counts in one indictment is there are four different circumstances in 279.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.102" offset="13087744">The one of the four that we selected is where the crimes charged are connected together and are part of a common scheme or plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.603" offset="13121808">Now, by a motion before the appellate court, you can sever this indictment. But before the trial court, these indictments could be severed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.825" offset="13154722">Now, these things then are by law, by the lore of pleading in criminal matters of our state interrelated charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.194" offset="13184188">I want to also say that in these 48 counts, the first four of them deal with criminal anarchy and charged all the defendants with the commission of that crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.100" offset="13227760">But the first three deals with criminal anarchy and the fourth is conspiracy to commit criminal action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.161" offset="13252002">Now, the others -- the other counts in the indictment have nothing to do with criminal anarchy but are there because they're interrelated with the ultimate purpose of this indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.193" offset="13308113">Count five is a conspiracy to commit arson in the third degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.700" offset="13330160">It does not -- that count is not charged against everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.099" offset="13343744">Many of the defendants are not charged with that missed case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.170" offset="13356074">Count six permitting -- the count seven dealing with -- countsix and seven deal with permitting premises, misdemeanor, permitting premises to be used for anarchy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.921" offset="13399019">The remaining counts, 41 and all deal with weapons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.757" offset="13414379">Now, this may be a little but abstruse but it's important to make this one point that four of these 41 counts that deal with weapons, deal with handguns and thirty seven deal with shoulder guns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.022" offset="13471431">Under the weapons law of New York which I told this Court, I am the author of -- last time, mere possession of a hand gun in four of these 41 counts is all the prosecution has to establish to convict of a crime but for shoulder guns, rifles, shotguns, carbines, you need proof of intent to use unlawfully against another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.275" offset="13572472">And there's a good reason for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.593" offset="13577697">A lot of people have rifles to hunt animals, but pistols and revolvers and automatic weapons normally are used only to hunt other human beings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.683" offset="13626075">The only proof of intent to use unlawfully against another we have for this indictment and the only evidence that was before the grand jury at the time the case was presented was the intent to paralyze and overthrow local government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.645" offset="13685948">Consequently, when counsel says that you can -- you can't when irreparable injury is done, grave and immediate because of the possibility of concurrent sentences in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.469" offset="13741223">That is not so and I will demonstrate why its not because there are first of all four defendants in this case who are not charged with possession of weapon, I amend that there were five who are not charged with possession of weapons, Harriet Knoll, Raymond Smith, Fernandez, Ms. West, and Stan -- Max Stanford.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.125" offset="13843832">Those five are not charged with any possession of weapons in this indictment, it isn't because they didn't posses weapons but because when these search warrants were executed, they were not found in possession of the weapons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.986" offset="13895346">Therefore, these five people, of these five people three of them are charged with no anarchy crimes at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.938" offset="13931081">So in these five cases that are charged, pardon me, with no non-anarchy crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.151" offset="13955950">So in these -- three of these five cases, we have persons who could be convicted only of anarchy connected crimes and not of any correlative crimes and the doctrine of concurrent sentences would not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.923" offset="14011016">I -- if I am not mistaken, if I -- as I read Benton against Maryland, this Court last term abandoned the concurrent sentence doctrine anyway so that the reason for this position of Epton no longer holds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.830" offset="14078725">But many can -- in any case we have three persons that could be convicted solely of this anarchy connected crimes under this indictment and would have full opportunity to bring the question of the validity of the New York statute before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.555" offset="14133582">By the way the New York statute that we're talking about has then repealed by Section -- by action of the legislature on July 20th, 1965, that's five years, almost five years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.090" offset="14191783">The repeal was to take effect on September 1st, 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.399" offset="14212995">This was in connection with an entire revision of the New York penal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.054" offset="14231594">Now, and a new anarchy section was substituted on July 20th, 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.833" offset="14262732">Now, so far as this indictment is concerned, it was handed down we say originally in -- on June 20th, 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.296" offset="14300557">The Court of Appeals -- the Epton case began in July of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.546" offset="14337546">Epton was tried in June of 1965 and convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.842" offset="14374745">The -- he didn't get through with the first intermediate appellate court until December of 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.142" offset="14403897">And the highest court of the state came down with their decision in Epton on May 16th, 1967, one month and four days before the grand jury indicted the persons in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.864" offset="14454784">Now, it is true that some of the acts for which these people are accused took place prior to the announcement of the decision in Epton.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.527" offset="14497520">But there is one other unusual feature of our weapons law in New York and that is the amnesty features.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.527" offset="14525524">And under the amnesty feature, any person at that time if they had read Epton, when it come down on May 16th and were following the law as closely as counsel seems to suppose they would come into a police station during the month of June, today they can come in during any month and hand over these guns with amnesty and immunity given by the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.245" offset="14628342">That is Section 1900, subdivision (a) (1) of the former New York penal law enforced in effect at the time this indictment came down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.143" offset="14663973">This is a defense of recantation and amnesty given by New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.415" offset="14685080">So if these people were being guided by what the highest court of this -- of the state said on May 16th, they could have recant it, turned in thereof with impunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.883" offset="14734921">And believe me there would be no indictment in this case if all we had is what appears in the appendix in Harris against Younger namely statements or pamphlets or speeches or abstract advocacy of the doctrine of anarchy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.662" offset="14798033">What we're concerned with was in this case, the amassing of an arsenal for the purpose of paralyzing and overthrowing government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.249" offset="14828335">Now, this Court in its most recent pronouncement on the question of free speech, Brandenburg at the last term on June 9th say that you may punish a person for advocacy, for words provided it's accompanied by inciting and producing lawless action and there is probable cause that that lawless action would occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.664" offset="14942020">Now, the minutes of the grand jury which are here before this Court show that they assembled 9000 rounds of ammunition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.545" offset="14977546">They assembled cans of gasoline, cans of oil, intending to burn the subways, the power plant, the lumber yards, the tire factories, public communications facilities in Queens County and they had a detailed blue print and a timetable for the execution of this plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.381" offset="15064900">The speech involved in this case, the advocacy only the -- is the mortise and tenon, the cement, the binding quality to put these acts for overthrow together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.911" offset="15126967">As a matter of fact on 16th, there was a dry run in which these weapons were used against some stores in the Jamaica section of Queens, the testimony before the grand jury so revealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.699" offset="15178167">And it's set forth in my brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="3802.657" offset="15314004">We have in a second indictment convicted two of these appellants in this case, Ferguson and Harris.</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.211" offset="15344201">They were convicted of conspiring to murder Whitney Young and Roy Wilkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="3814.542" offset="15361546">They had other people on the list as well but they were the first two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3819.226" offset="15380250">They had a trial before a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3821.599" offset="15389759">The intermediate appellate court, five judges found unanimously that there was sufficient evidence to convict but three judge -- two judges dissented of the five on the grounds that because Senator Robert Kennedy whose name was also on the list to be killed was mentioned at a time when he was lying between life and death that a new trial should be granted or the judge should've granted a continuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3847.373" offset="15492890">The highest court of our state, seven judges found identically, unanimously that there was sufficient evidence to convict them of conspiracy to commit murder in the first degree and -- but they also agreed, three of them agreed that maybe the trial judge should've granted a continuance of that -- on the count of the circumstance of the assassination of President Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3870.684" offset="15586095">I'd like to say this in connection with the question of the Section 2291 -- the 2283.</text>
            <text syncTime="3890.394" offset="15664985">For 177 years, we've had that statute on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="3894.365" offset="15680867">March 2nd, 1793 and never once has this Court in anyway said that a lower court, that's a creature of Congress, must not observe that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.209" offset="15740217">For 99 years since 1781, we had the provisions of Section 1983, the so-called Civil Rights Act which gives a person a cause of action, an action at law, a suit and equity or other problem, means of redress if any rights, privileges or immunities guaranteed to him by the Constitution of the United States are taken away from him under color of state law, never in 99 years has this Court ever held that that constitutes the word, the three words suit in equity constitutes and exception to 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="3947.557" offset="15893608">Now, recently this Court has taken up this question, they took it up in Dombrowski against Pfister ad very carefully Justice Brennan in writing that opinion observe the restrictions of the Act of 1793.</text>
            <text syncTime="3963.360" offset="15956825">And Justice Harlan in his first footnote in his dissenting opinion also called the attention of the Court that if there had been an action pending at the time of application to the federal court then of course this Court could not reverse any -- could not just authorize intervention below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3984.288" offset="16040521">Again it came up in several other cases, Cameron against Johnson is a good illustration from Mississippi, came up from Mississippi and were sent back by this Court to the District Court in the Southern District of Mississippi to have them determine whether 2283 was a bar and the District Court of Mississippi, three-judge District Court came back and said yes, we think the suit is barred by 2283 and this Court affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4010.796" offset="16146578">But there was a footnote by Justice Douglas where he said, “Well, we don't have to decide the question of 2283.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4017.467" offset="16173223">But still this Court did affirm the determination of the District Court of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="4021.863" offset="16190777">Again in Brooks against Briley from Tennessee, same thing, District Court there, three-judge District Court said, “You can't get by here with 2283.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4032.303" offset="16232573">Can't get by -- “No, can you get by on the companion declaratory judgment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4036.638" offset="16249919">A case came up to the Supreme Court affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4039.038" offset="16259532">This are all very recent cases all involving 1983 as an exception to 2283.</text>
            <text syncTime="4045.184" offset="16284087">Again in Zwickler against Boll coming from Wisconsin, same result, this Court's affirming, the District Court's denying.</text>
            <text syncTime="4053.330" offset="16316688">So the most recent authority in this Court is that 2283 is hurdle.</text>
            <text syncTime="4058.120" offset="16335809">Now you have two hurdles to surmount before we can get to the question of free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="4062.030" offset="16351483">You have two hurdles to surmount.</text>
            <text syncTime="4063.704" offset="16358170">One, you got to get by this historic barrier of Congress since 1793, you've got to surmount that hurdle before you can go anywhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="4073.718" offset="16398294">The 26 words that were put in amending the parent statute, the Judiciary Act of 1789, 26 words have to be observed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4083.692" offset="16438105">Now, this Court has repeatedly said in 1941, they said in the Natuzzi case, we must be scrupulous, must be scrupulous about the bound -- the meets and bounds that Congress sets for courts of their own creation, must be scrupulous.</text>
            <text syncTime="4098.720" offset="16498291">Then in 1948, when Congress codified three exceptions, in 1951, this Court revisited once again the statute of 1793 and at that time they said, you got to go by those three exceptions of Congress and you can't go any further.</text>
            <text syncTime="4117.611" offset="16573837">Now, there's another consideration involved here, it interrupted and stayed in the federal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4123.390" offset="16596929">And that is that this tribunal which is a constitutional tribunal, is not a circuit court or a (Audio Static) Constitution yet Congress in fixing which they have the power to do in Article 3, Section 2, the appellate jurisdiction of this Court carefully requires that there'd be a final judgment of a state tribunal and a decision by the highest court in which a decision can be had before state action may be reviewed by this, a constitutional tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4160.572" offset="16745618">How can we then say that this Court is going by statutory interpretation, this isn't a constitutional question, if to lower federal courts, a power it does not even arrogate to its self?</text>
            <text syncTime="4172.669" offset="16793997">Why Congress has the power unless this Court wants to overrule Ex parte McCarthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4177.189" offset="16812178">Congress has the power to take this case right away from this Court now by taking away appellate jurisdiction over any questions, let's say of denial of injunctions by three-judge courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="4188.955" offset="16859199">Unless we overrule Ex parte McCarthy which involves free speech, which involve free speech that would be the result.</text>

            <text syncTime="4256.894" offset="17130977">Yes, but the cases which this Court says are exceptions where the federal court can enjoin are there are a quite a number.</text>
            <text syncTime="4266.501" offset="17169324">In 1851, a ship owner who deposits a money equal to the debt can relieve a lien against this ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="4275.282" offset="17204537">In 1875, a bankruptcy exception was allowed namely that all proceedings in state as well as federal courts will be stayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4284.474" offset="17241318">Several other exceptions have been allowed by Congress to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4288.820" offset="17258663">They allow it in connection with the Frazier-Lemke Farm Mortgage Act during the depression in 1930's.</text>
            <text syncTime="4295.952" offset="17287189">The state collection proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4298.248" offset="17296384">They have allowed it in the famous habeas of our immemorial habeas corpus act, Federal Habeas Corpus Act, they can stop all proceedings in a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4308.595" offset="17337762">They allow it and the Interpleader Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4310.799" offset="17346539">But in all of these cases as this Court said in Amalgamated Clothing Workers against Richman in 1951 after the amendment, in all of these cases, the language that Congress used is pretty explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4321.378" offset="17388857">It doesn't have to refer to 1983 by number.</text>
            <text syncTime="4324.913" offset="17403068">But it has to be pretty explicit and stay -- say that proceedings may be stayed either in a state court or in any court or it may say that all proceedings shall cease wherever they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="4336.196" offset="17448208">They use a collocation of words quite different than merely a suit in equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4340.163" offset="17463986">Now a suit in equity can be brought for a lot of things as Your Honors well knows, a bill quia timet, an action for recession of a contract, a lot of suits in equity can be brought without resorting to a stay or an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4356.727" offset="17530232">Injunction isn't the only type of equitable remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4359.675" offset="17542040">Second, a suit in equity can be brought in a state court and the state court could grant a stay without running into the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4368.154" offset="17575999">And third and this is important, the suit in equity can be brought even to stay, a threatened procedure proceeding in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4383.243" offset="17636394">And in that respect, our case, this is the most restrictive interpretation, the most limiting interpretation on 19 -- on 2283, Ex parte Young of course tells us that the -- the memorial -- the memorable congressional statute requires that the proceeding be in a state court and if it is not in a state court then of course its possible to get an injunction against a threatened prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4417.243" offset="17772335">Now, this Court has seven related cases involving injunctions by three -- either denial or granting of injunctions by the three-judge District Courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="4428.443" offset="17817161">The first case, Number 4, Harris against Younger, in that case the court -- the three-judge court did grant an injunction and one of the three applicants for the injunction, Harris, had an indictment pending against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4442.940" offset="17875153">There you have a question of a clear cut violation of the provisions of 2283 in connection with the other two applicants, Broslawsky, Dan and Hirsch, nobody indicted them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4456.497" offset="17929383">And our interpretation of 2283 is that so far as enjoining the District Attorney if Los Angeles County from commencing a prosecution against Professor Broslawsky or the labor union leaders, Dan and Hirsch, that 2283 doesn't effect because there was no proceeding in a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4478.111" offset="18015796">Boyle against Landry as I understand it, there was no pending case in the state court so I'm question -- I question whether 2283 has any application there.</text>

            <text syncTime="4795.845" offset="19286706">Now, in the most re -- Brandenburg case, this Court pointed out that there was no refinement of the charge in that case either by the trial judge or by the highest court of the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="4809.679" offset="19342085">In our case there are many more stages of refinement that this proceeding has interrupted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4815.248" offset="19364342">For example, at page 89 of the appendix to my brief, Section 295, I think it is (g) of the code of criminal procedure, says mandatorily in the form of the indictment that we used which is a short form indictment, mandatorily the District Attorney shall deliver a bill of particulars to the defendant provided he applies to the judge for one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4840.135" offset="19463920">The first stage of refinement is that we would have to particularize what we rely on to convict this defendant and we must do so mandatorily.</text>
            <text syncTime="4848.779" offset="19498506">It's not in the discretion of a judge, state court judge to deny a bill of particulars.</text>
            <text syncTime="4853.137" offset="19515956">Second, at the trial of this case, the trial judge will have to give instructions to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4859.238" offset="19540302">At that time he can clearly state and incorporate anything that has been laid down by this Court in Brandenburg and by the highest court of our state in Epton.</text>
            <text syncTime="4869.972" offset="19583248">Third, the highest court of the state will reveal this conviction and we're reminded in -- that 1947 case coming from New York County against New York, the opinion by Justice Reed, the name, it forgets me, I worked on the case myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4888.685" offset="19658062">That if the highest court of a state amends a statute by construing it then those words of the highest court of the state must be taken to be part of the state statute itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="4941.625" offset="19869863">Now, as between robbery and criminal anarchy, there is this distinction, if a robber sets out and succeeds in getting the loot, taking it from a crime, he is not home free because he may later be apprehended and put in jail.</text>

            <text syncTime="4992.459" offset="20073200">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4995.680" offset="20086053">Counsel for appellant Samuels in his brief has asked that the clear and present danger test which this Court approved in Dennis be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="5005.431" offset="20125132">He has not suggested any substitute test.</text>
            <text syncTime="5008.923" offset="20139029">It is apparently his position that advocating the overthrow of the Government must always be a form of protected speech regardless of its intent, regardless of the context, regardless of the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="5022.984" offset="20195349">This interpretation of the First Amendment is erroneous because it totally ignores the physical danger that can be created by a speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="5033.567" offset="20237667">As in an analogous situation of a man shouting fire in a crowded theater, we must look to the intent and possible consequences of speech in order to determine whether it is within the protected area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5046.922" offset="20291062">In the case at bar, the entire fabric of the answered question was the intent to use force to immobilize state and local authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="5056.584" offset="20329723">Aside from the non-speech elements which have already been described, the act of speech were very far from intellectual discussion of doctrine but instead sent it around, organizing youth for acts of violence in Queens County, how to use pipes and gunpowder for the making of bombs and proficiency in terror tactics.</text>
            <text syncTime="5078.428" offset="20417076">Without the anarchy statute, only the weapons counts not requiring intent and the arson counts would proceed and the indictment would have to be dismissed against approximately ten defendants even though there actions created a clear and present danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="5095.038" offset="20483532">It is not difficult to apply the clear and present danger test and the required showing of incitement to action to these charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="5103.862" offset="20518849">There are reasonable grounds to believe that the threat to the state's functioning was immanent and about to commence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5111.064" offset="20547584">This Court made clear in Dennis that even where an attempt to overthrow the Government is likely to fall short of complete achievement, it presents a sufficient evil for the state to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5123.579" offset="20597739">The Court said and I quote, “The damage with such attempts create both physically and politically to a nationmakes it impossible to measure the validity in terms of the probability of success.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5137.447" offset="20653119">These words are particularly significant in the light of the indictment here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5141.388" offset="20668897">In New York City, the cutting off of electrical power by sabotage combined with arson in subway and transportation lines would not only paralyze the central governmental services but would create the kind of chaos which would prevent the state from organizing and governing effectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="5158.408" offset="20737024">New York has a right to prevent advocacy which is one step before the explosion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5164.509" offset="20761370">Counsel for appellant Fernandez pointed out that the clear and present danger test and the requirement of the incitement is not cons -- contained on the face of the statute but this Court made clear in Dennis that it does not have to be in high clear view in the statute but that it is a test of judicial applicability that it can be read in and the New York Court of Appeals has already done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5191.740" offset="20870353">Appellants claim that the statute at issue will have a deterrent effect upon activities such as advocacy of unpopular ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5199.984" offset="20903267">And I also indicate that there can be no such deterrence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5204.793" offset="20922493">Prosecutions under both the old and the new statutes must be governed by Epton's requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="5211.479" offset="20949243">This interpretation places mere advocacy outside the ambit of the statute thus the only group whose rights might not be affected by the Epton decision would be a hypothetical group who are deterred be -- by the statute prior to May 1967 but who cannot be prosecuted for any of their activities as the present law forbids penalizing advocacy which creates no clear and present danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="5239.272" offset="21060420">Thus this hypothetical group cannot even be identified and if they were deterred it was by a statute which is no longer in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5248.325" offset="21096678">The hypothetical rights of this hypothetical group most certainly do not present any actual controversy and under this Court's rationale in Golden versus Zwickler, decision rendered on such facts would be advisory and therefore inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5266.883" offset="21170866">Appellants say that they were not given notice that their conduct was included in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5277.318" offset="21212662">The statute was made narrower by the Epton interpretation therefore there'd be no question, the statute as written provided warning of its applicability to the conduct here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5288.095" offset="21255711">Furthermore, the hardcore activities at issue here as the court below pointed on at the very center of the statute's circumference.</text>
            <text syncTime="5299.082" offset="21299702">As indicated by this Court on the procedural issue, Congress has constitutional power to provide that all federal issues be tried in the federal courts, that all be tried in the state courts or that the jurisdiction of such issues be shared.</text>
            <text syncTime="5315.452" offset="21365217">Congress is constitutionally free to establish the conditions under which civil or criminal proceedings involving federal issues may be removed from one court to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="5326.600" offset="21409729">While the right to free speech and the right to due process are conferred by the Constitution, the question of proper forum is statutory.</text>
            <text syncTime="5335.668" offset="21446092">Section 2283 has plainly precluded injunctive relief in the pending prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5342.733" offset="21474304">Counsel for appellant Fernandez argues that declaratory relief would not violate the statute and will forward essentially the same remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5351.271" offset="21508472">However, the rendering of such relief would frustrate the purposes of Section 2283 and destroy the principles of comity between state and federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5360.206" offset="21544208">And that in inevitable disruption of state prosecutions would occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="5364.753" offset="21562389">State courts have the same duty and power to rule upon federal constitutional issues in the same way as the federal courts and in most cases where a prosecution is already pending, less delay would adhere in resolving the issues in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5382.941" offset="21635114">If a statute is overbroad, the state courts have the same power as the federal courts to strike it down, to prevent any chilling effect upon First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5393.605" offset="21677746">I think the federal removal statute which was referred to earlier by Mr. Justice Marshall provides evidence of congressional intent to keep cases in the state courts where there are pending prosecutions already commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="5408.729" offset="21738245">The removal statute allows determination of state proceedings only in very narrow circumstances and this provides congressional guidance on the issue of declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5423.646" offset="21797909">As the clear and present test is one of judicial applicability as this Court found in Dennis versus United States, the application of this statute to appellants can only be determined upon a full record in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5436.485" offset="21849318">The need for such a record supplies a further ground for non-intervention in this case.</text>
