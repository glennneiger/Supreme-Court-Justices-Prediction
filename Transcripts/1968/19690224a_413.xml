            <text syncTime="35.202" offset="244172">I am Andrew A. Vanore Jr., I'm a member of the staff for the Attorney General of North Carolina and I represent the petitioners, the State of North Carolina and Warden R.L. Turner in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.608" offset="297775">The single issue involved in this particular case is upon retrial for the same offense which has been set aside on appeal or post-conviction proceeding due to a constitutional defect in the first trial, may the second trial court impose a harsher punishment upon the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.543" offset="397563">The facts briefly stated are Clifton A. Pearce, the respondent in this particular case, was initially tried at the May 1961 term of the Superior Court of Durham County, North Carolina on the capital charge of rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.339" offset="480737">Upon arraignment, the prosecuting attorney or the solicitor announced that he would not seek a verdict in excess of assault with intent to commit rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.602" offset="521801">The jury found the defendant guilty of assault with intent to commit rape and the judge imposed a sentence of 12 to 15 years upon the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.920" offset="563075">The defendant started serving the sentence on May 25, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.826" offset="586689">In 1965, the defendant filed a petition under the Post-Conviction Relief Act questioning the admissibility of a confession introduced against him in the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.928" offset="647084">Relief was denied by the Superior Court of Durham County on May 10, 1965 and certiorari was accepted by the Supreme Court of North Carolina which reversed the case and awarded the defendant a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.772" offset="718451">The defendant was released from custody upon the first sentence imposed upon him on February 2, 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.966" offset="755231">At that particular time, he had served four years, eight months and six days flat time and six years, seven months and 16 days flat and gain time.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.818" offset="806640">The gain time being computed upon 150 days granted to the defendant for each year of service on the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.428" offset="861080">The defendant was tried the second time at the June 6, 1966 term of the Superior Court of Durham County upon an indictment charging assault with intent to commit rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.860" offset="910817">The jury found him guilty of assault with intent to commit rape and the presiding judge who specifically stated in his judgment that he was taking into consideration the fact that the defendant had served six years, seven months and 16 days flat and gain time was going to impose only a sentence of eight years upon the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.496" offset="1017396">The judge stated in his judgment that it was his intention to impose the maximum sentence allowed by statute for the offense which is 15 years however, because of the gain time and so forth he reduced it to eight years.</text>
