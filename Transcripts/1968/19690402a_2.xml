            <text syncTime="33.582" offset="239741">Mr. Robb?</text>

          <turn speaker="roger_robb" startTime="34.659" stopTime="620.111">
            <label>Mr. Roger Robb</label>
            <text syncTime="34.659" offset="244025">May it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.628" offset="267954">The facts in this case may be briefly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.412" offset="291046">In 1964, the petitioner Red Lion broadcasts a 15-minute program by one Billy James Hargis, in which Mr. Hargis attacked Mr. Fred J. Cook in connection with a book that Mr. Cook had written.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.198" offset="378190">The Hargis talk was part of a series and was carried on a number of other radio stations and Red Lion was paid for the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.531" offset="431585">Having learned of the attack, Mr. Cook wrote to Red Lion invoking the so-called personal attack doctrine of the Federal Communications Commission and demanding that he be given time to reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.217" offset="498249">In response, Red Lion offered to make time available to Mr. Cook at the station's regular rate, or to give Mr. Cook free time if he stated that he would -- that he could not pay for time.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.928" offset="581110">Mr. Cook rejected the offer of time on a paid basis and refused to state that he could not pay for time.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.877" offset="620920">And he complained to the Federal Communications Commission that Red Lion was in violation of the so-called personal attack doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.738" offset="668359">The commission ruled that having presented a personal attack on an individual and his honesty, character or integrity in connection with a controversial matter of public importance, Red Lion was bound by the personal attack rule and doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.714" offset="780267">To inform Mr. Cook, the individual involved of the attack, to send him a tape or a transcript or a summary of the broadcast, and upon his demand to afford him free time to reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.039" offset="857590">The commission held that that Mr. Cook was under no obligation to make any showing of inability to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.245" offset="890399">Red Lion was directed it to comply with this ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.939" offset="913178">Red Lion appealed to the Court of Appeals for this circuit which stay in the commission's ruling and this Court thereafter granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.452" offset="963229">I might interpolate that as this Court has recognized, this case is a companion case and closely involved with the next case Number 717, that the Red Lion situation involve a specific application of the rule involved in Number 717.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.116" offset="1045880">In the interest of clarity, might be helpful to the outset to suggest certain matters which I conceive are not in issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.930" offset="1089139">First, there is no question but that the Hargis broadcast contained a personal attack on Mr. Cook within the meaning of the definition of the F.C.C.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.975" offset="1149325">Second, there is no issue as to the truth or falsity of the Hargis broadcast or after the good faith of Hargis in making it or the good faith of Red Lion in broadcasting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.993" offset="1221423">The ruling of the commission and the opinion of the court below make it clear that these matters where held to be immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.782" offset="1268548">In other words, Red Lion was bound to comply with the commission's order whether the broadcast was true or false, and whether the broadcaster carried it believing it to true or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.266" offset="1334481">Third and obviously, there is no issue here as to whether Mr. Hargis and his philosophy about Mr. Cook and his are worthy or unworthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.081" offset="1393727">The issue is simply one of law without regard to the personal beliefs or philosophies of the individuals involved, where otherwise, I might not be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.432" offset="1451196">Fourth, it is conceded I believe by the Government perhaps with some qualifications that radio and television are part of the press protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.642" offset="1512009">Now, I'm informed that Mr. Cox in Number 17-717 will discuss rather fully of the statutory questions involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.419" offset="1567075">I would like, if I might, to focus briefly upon the constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.461" offset="1627261">Simply stated the issue here I suggest is whether or not the order of the Federal Communications Commission to Red Lion imposes a burden of previous restraint upon free speech in the press which is forbidden by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.357" offset="1730811">Does this order imposed on Red Lion a burden?</text>
            <text syncTime="413.263" offset="1758501">We submit that obviously it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.892" offset="1773025">The burden consists of the cost of preparing a tape or a transcript, of sending it to the individual attacked and providing free time, and perhaps and I emphasize this, perhaps providing free time by displacing some other program which is paid for.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.414" offset="1871036">This as I understand the Government's brief, they concede that a burden is imposed, but they assert somewhat blandly I think that the cost is not substantial and the burden is not undo.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.712" offset="1940313">And likewise Judge Tamm thought that such a burden was not unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.582" offset="1967794">Now in general, we challenge the proposition that the exercise of First Amendment rights maybe burdened with the financial penalty so long as the Government or the Federal Communications Commission thinks the amount of the penalty is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.536" offset="2051594">We ask what standard does the Government apply to determine what is reasonable and what is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.934" offset="2089106">Would the Government say that a large Chicago television station which is required to donate 15 minutes of time for which a commercial sponsor would be charged $2,000.00?</text>
            <text syncTime="512.340" offset="2154830">Would the Government say that that station is not subjected to an unreasonable and honorous burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.294" offset="2190566">We submit that the commandment of the First Amendment is simply "thou shall not abridge" and it is not "you may abridge but please try to keep it reasonable."</text>
            <text syncTime="536.734" offset="2252319">In any event, the impact of a financial penalty and the threat of future penalties are serious matters for Red Lion Broadcasting Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.820" offset="2316685">This station is located in the City of Red Lion, Pennsylvania which is a small town, having a population of less than 6,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.244" offset="2366422">As the record discloses, it is a daytime only station which must compete for revenues with two fulltime and one daytime station located in the York, Pennsylvania, and a fulltime station Hanover, Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.723" offset="2460359">York, the county seat with the population of some 55,000 is only six miles away.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.455" offset="2491288">Hanover is 18 miles away.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.836" offset="2504767">There for a small station facing such competition, any donation of free time as a practical matter is not a trivial concern, and repeated donations might very well drive the station out of existence.</text>

            <text syncTime="653.477" offset="2719284">But I think we have to consider in analyzing the effect of this order for regulation, consider the entire impact that went on the station and the disruption of programming for station is a very serious matter, specially --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="666.206" stopTime="673.933">
            <label>Justice Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="666.206" offset="2770275">Mr. Robb, is there any possibility putting on the public time?</text>
            <text syncTime="671.397" offset="2790964">The station has a certain mile of that, am I right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="roger_robb" startTime="673.933" stopTime="1775.968">
            <label>Mr. Roger Robb</label>
            <text syncTime="673.933" offset="2801204">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.897" offset="2809041">The record shows Mr. Justice Marshall that this station carries one hour a day called free speech and that on this program, anyone who wishes to appear may appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.963" offset="2877273">I don't know whether Mr. Cook would insist the station to pay his expenses to get there or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.867" offset="2900888">That might be the possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.851" offset="2916874">Now, I mentioned the possibility of repeated request for donations.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.462" offset="2943310">There is no doubt that the rule of the F.C.C. in this case would expose the station to repeated demands for free time, unless the station steered clear of the dangerous zone of personal attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.870" offset="3024917">This very broadcast is a good illustration of this proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.229" offset="3050308">The broadcast is printed at pages 60 and 61 of the appendix and appears therein at this one broadcast contained attacks not only on Mr. Cook but on three other people or groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.697" offset="3128257">Mr. Hargis attacked a man named Eugene Gleason, whom he identified as Mr. Cook's pal.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.214" offset="3162321">He attacked the magazine, The Nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.266" offset="3174442">He attacked Mr. Carry McWilliams, the editor of The Nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.307" offset="3190638">Now, if Red Lion were oblige to devote time for a reply to each of these attacks, would the Government then say that the cost and the disruption of the station's business where insubstantial?</text>
            <text syncTime="787.927" offset="3257093">Now, I suggest that this broadcast furthermore is a striking example of the fact that the personal attack doctrine as applied by the commission fragments every discussion of a controversial matter of public interest and importance, in due has many separate controversies and issues as there happened to be individuals or groups who happen to be attacked in the course of the broadcast.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.815" offset="3392721">Now, if the speaker happens to speak critically for a dozen individuals, each of them thereby becomes instantly a controversial matter or issue of public importance, and the broadcaster maybe required to provide free time for a dozen of answers which would be an onerous burden indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.107" offset="3501808">We think this threat is substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.707" offset="3524274">We think of the words of this Court in Cantwell against Connecticut in which the Court said this, “It is not merely the sporadic abused of power by the censor, but the pervasive threat inherent in this very existence that constitutes the danger to freedom of discussion”.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.143" offset="3625942">We asked, can it be set that the financial penalties and the other burdens which are -- and the penalties incidentally have the effect of a fine, and the persuasive and the pervasive threat of similar penalties in the future do not and could not have a chilling and deterrent effect upon the exercise by Red Lion of his First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.613" offset="3783826">Do these penalties and burdens and this threat for the future constitute an inhibition and a deterrent less substantial than the one struck by -- the ones that was struck down by this Court in Talley against California and Speiser against Randall?</text>
            <text syncTime="945.269" offset="3886540">We submit that the answer must be no.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.030" offset="3901586">We submit the common sense tells us plainly that the application of the commission's rule and the threat of future applications are bound to make Red Lion in the future more reluctant to broadcast any material that involve the criticism of any individual or group.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.038" offset="4009524">Undoubtedly, we submit, Red Lion in the future would tread more cautiously, steering wider of the dangerous zone of criticism.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.492" offset="4059366">The result will be self-censorship, nonetheless virulent for having been self imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.667" offset="4100117">Now, the Government argues that the personal attack rule is necessary in order that the public may have both sides of controversial issues, and specifically so the public may hear both the attack and the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.421" offset="4187052">The argument we suggest overlooks the fact that if the personal attack rule is sustained, the public is likely to hear neither the attack nor the answer, for the reason that the attack may never be broadcast at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.051" offset="4269599">Instead of stimulating wide open, robust and uninhibited debate, the rule will tend to choke it off at the source.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.218" offset="4318292">To prevent the introduction of any alleged impurity into the stream, the Government proposes to dry it up at its source.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.354" offset="4370850">Now, the Government argues further that a person attacked on a number of radio stations maybe financially unable to pay for time on them all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.728" offset="4424349">Therefore, says the Government, it's right that he should be given free time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.742" offset="4452352">One answer to this argument may be found we think in the language of this Court in Cantwell against Connecticut, where the Court said and I quote, “To persuade others to his own point of view, the pleader as we know at times resort to exaggeration, to vilification of man who have been or are prominent in church or state, and even to false statement, but the people of this nation have ordained in the light of history that in spite of the probability of excesses and abuses, these liberties are in the long run essential to enlighten opinion and right conduct on the bottom citizens of a democracy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.505" offset="4651405">We submit in this case that the possibility of isolated abuses and individual cases of such abuses cannot justify the imposition of a stifling blanket of restraint on the First Amendment rights of all broadcasting stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.665" offset="4764045">Now, the Government's argument when analyzed rests on the premise that those who listened and who listened -- listen to the programs of Red Lion have no other source of information, no access to a wide diversity of opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.398" offset="4875013">The facts destroyed the underpinning of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.465" offset="4895284">According to the broadcasting yearbook and TV digest fact book for 1969, the regions of the City of Red Lion have access to radio programs broadcast from nine towns or cities, which are Hanover, Pennsylvania, Harrisburg, Carlyle, Elizabeth Town, Lancaster, Lebanon, York, Philadelphia and Baltimore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.958" offset="5033211">They have access to television programs from five different cities, namely Lancaster, Lebanon, Harrisburg, York and Baltimore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.466" offset="5087336">It is inconceivable that the listening audience of Red Lion remains glued to that station's frequency, isolated and insulated from all other sources of information and opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.763" offset="5152434">The possibility of a failure of diversity of tongues and diversity of opinion, we submit is most remote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.915" offset="5189110">Again, the Government relies upon the fact that this Court held in the National Broadcasting Company case that radio broadcasting is subject to regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.025" offset="5245534">We agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.004" offset="5249400">It did hold that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.353" offset="5258804">But it does not follow from that decision and that the Government may dictate the content of radio programs or impose burdens on the exercise of First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.295" offset="5318572">The Government may assign frequencies and channels, giving consideration to the character and the financial standing and ability of an applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.902" offset="5365070">It may evaluate the total performance of a broadcaster during the term of his license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.820" offset="5400701">It may supervise the methods of competition adopted by broadcasters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.943" offset="5429227">But all of such regulation, we submit, is a far cry from the order to Red Lion which dictates what the content of a particular program shall be and who the speaker shall be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.081" offset="5501743">Eventhough Red Lion may have been fair, may have broadcast other points of view, Red Lion is told by the commission, you must put on Mr. Cook, you must give him time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.953" offset="5549181">An order of this sort, we submit, is precisely the kind of censorship and abridgement that the First Amendment condemns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.028" offset="5593485">Now, as this Court has consistently held when First Amendment rights are tangled with conduct, which the Government may regulate, the First Amendment rights must be preserved and they must not be curtailed by regulation directed at the abuses which are subject to Government control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.345" offset="5702781">Where if not so, then freedom of speech in the press would always be subject to abridgement and control by the subtle and indirect method of associating them and their exercise with other conduct which might be controlled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.910" offset="5793061">Finally, the Government seeks comfort from the fact that the number of radio frequencies is limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.058" offset="5841648">It follows we are told that broadcasters hold these frequencies in trust with the public, and they must therefore bow to the interest of the public as that maybe interpreted and defined by the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.031" offset="5909567">But the public streets, the public parks, the public buildings are likewise held in trust for the public, yet this Court has not permitted that fact to justify restraints upon the exercise therein of First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.282" offset="5998592">In any event, we submit that the First Amendment rights of radio broadcasters should not be conditioned on the number of radio stations in existence, whether there be few or many should not determine whether they should enjoy the protection and the full protection of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.494" offset="6103395">Finally, if the number and diversity of tongues are factors to be considered, we point to the fact that there are more than 6,000 commercial radio stations in this country today, three and a half times as many radio stations as there are daily newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.497" offset="6191376">And we've urged you to say that the circulation and the listening public of those radio stations far exceeds the circulation and the reading public of daily newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.287" offset="6254592">Now, a word aired to the Government's argument that the personal attack doctrine is authorized by statute, specifically Section 315 and other sections of the Communications Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.197" offset="6334213">Mr. Cox as I am reliably informed will discuss this matter in his argument, we have mentioned it in our brief, we support and adopt Mr. Cox's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.535" offset="6387608">We make these points very briefly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.010" offset="6405475">The first place, the statute definingly functions, powers and duties of the Federal Communications Commission certainly does not in terms authorize the personal attack rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.483" offset="6467333">Certainly, we say that meddling with the control of the programs or the content of programs is no part of the Federal Communications Commission's function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.258" offset="6518429">We suggest furthermore that a statute which purports or is claimed to authorize impingement upon First Amendment rights must be strictly construed and carefully examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.915" offset="6585093">It should not be broadly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.006" offset="6601394">With respect to the argument that the 1959 Amendment to Section 315 (a) authorized the personal attack rule, we point out that that amendment was adopted three years before the personal attack rule was articulated by the Federal Communications Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.029" offset="6721557">And therefore, it seemed somewhat difficult to conclude that the Congress intended in terms to refer to that rule and to authorize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.781" offset="6768577">We point out and suggest also that the purpose of the 1959 amendment was to cure a blackout which had been caused by a free time requirement, and therefore, it seemed somewhat anomalous to argue that Congress intended by this curative amendment to authorize a similar blackout caused by a free time requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.084" offset="6897727">Of course, we say also that if the statute does purport to authorize any such action by the commission, the statute is pro tanto unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.651" offset="6952061">In conclusion, we submit that this case plainly demonstrates the wisdom of what this Court said in Roth against United States and repeated in Smith against California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.376" offset="7022905">The Court said and I quote, “The fundamental freedoms of speech and press have contributed greatly to the development and well being of our free society, and though indispensable to its continued growth, ceaseless vigilance is the watchword to prevent the erosion by Congress or by the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.942" offset="7133142">The door barring federal and state intrusion into this area cannot be left to chart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.521" offset="7159474">It must be kept tightly closed and opened only the slightest crack necessary to prevent encroachment upon more important interest."</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="2015.858" offset="8168845">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.145" offset="8189952">This is the first of two cases presenting related to questions but in different circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.261" offset="8222448">In this case, we have specific facts but no formally announced rule or regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.625" offset="8259960">In the next case, United States and Federal Communications Commission against the Radio Television News Directors Association et al., Number 717, we have a formal regulation but no facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.848" offset="8332790">I will try to keep my argument separated as far as the two cases are concern, but much of the argument is necessarily applicable to both cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.891" offset="8385034">In the first place, I would like to make it plain that this is not a sudden determination of the Federal Communications Commission that it will be righteous and seek to enforce some kind of arbitrary standards on the broadcasting industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.733" offset="8456401">On the contrary, the problem is one of long standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.212" offset="8478239">It goes back for close to 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.292" offset="8494540">The first traces of it that I've seen are found in an address of the then Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover in 1924 when the commerce department was charged with the licensing of radio stations, and he pointed out that there were great problems in the handling of this new medium and the problems of seeing that all points of view were properly expressed among them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.132" offset="8613972">In its foundation, the problem is inherent in communication through electromagnetic waves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.215" offset="8646259">From the very beginning, Congress and the Federal Communications Commission and I think it's fair to say the broadcast industry had been grouping for a sound and workable solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.170" offset="8702056">I'm quite sure that we have not found the final answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.773" offset="8716476">There's still room for improvement through more thought and more experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.812" offset="8744688">But I feel its substantial progress has been made in dealing with a fundamental and important issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.335" offset="8782723">Let me start by referring to some reflections of the problem which are found in the basic statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.434" offset="8819190">I am going to quote a few passages from the Communication Act of 1934, but I would point out that virtually all of these were also in the Federal Radio Act of 1927.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.444" offset="8879167">The very opening sentence says in Section 301 of Title 47, “It is the purpose of this chapter among other things to maintain the control of the United States over all the channels of interstate and foreign radio transmission, and to provide for the use of such channels, but not the ownership thereof by persons for limited periods of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.723" offset="9008316">And no license granted under this section shall be construed to create any right beyond the terms, conditions and period of the license.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.728" offset="9060352">In Section 303, there is an expressed provision that a license maybe revoked if the licensee has transmitted superfluous radio communications or signals or communications containing profane or obscene words, language or meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.103" offset="9145825">And I suppose it's reasonably plain that a station's license could be revoked under that section, eventhough the language used was such that could not had been enjoined from being used because of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.571" offset="9211653">And then, there are provisions for licensing under which, the commission if public convenience, interest or necessity will be served thereby may grant licenses for periods of three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.631" offset="9279990">And there are provisions for revocation of licenses in case the station does not serve the public interest, convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.945" offset="9329204">There are provisions for revocation of licenses in cases of willful and repeated violation or, of or willful or repeated failure to observe any provision of this chapter or any rule or regulation of the commission authorized by this chapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.514" offset="9407467">And then, there is Section 315, the equal time provision, and I point out that that was included in the Federal Radio Act of 1927.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.390" offset="9458981">It is thus 42 years old, and in its particular field, it is an expression of the fairness doctrine under which if a station gives time to a political candidate, it must give equal time to other political candidates with qualifications which were put in 1959 into which I will refer a little later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.174" offset="9598161">In 1929, in a brief which the commission filed in the Great Lakes case, you find something of a beginning of an articulation of the fairness doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.478" offset="9655317">And over the next two decades, the commission in a series of individual rulings undertook to express the obligation of then radio stations to meet their requirements of the fairness doctrine, this being an interpretation by the commission of the standard included by Congress in the statute that these stations must operate in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.342" offset="9790840">In 1960, in 19 -- yes, in 1960, there -- well, let me wait before 1959 and '60.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.466" offset="9851235">In 1940, in the ruling in the Mayflower Broadcasting case, the commission instructed radio stations that they could not engage in editorializing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.744" offset="9920408">This may or may not have been the right thing to do, but it was an articulation of the fairness doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.511" offset="9947470">There was concern that stations with the great power they have could constantly reiterate one point of view and shut off all others, and the commission's approach in 1940 was to say you cannot editorialize.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.647" offset="10012045">But in 1949, after experienced with that, the commission issued its report on editorializing in which it changed its rule and it said you can editorialize but you must allow an opportunity for a response by responsible people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.432" offset="10099190">Now, that was the situation in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.355" offset="10122804">Ten years later, we come to 1959 when after the Lar Daly case which arose under Section 315 involving equal time, there was great concern because the commission and a Court of Appeals had held that every candidate was entitled to equal time, eventhough he had only a miniscule support.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.839" offset="10240773">And Congress amended Section 315 in 1959 to provide that appearances on a bonafide newscast, a bonafide news interview, a bonafide news documentary, and on the spot coverage of bonafide news events need not be taken into account in determining the long established congressional mandate, and expression I believe of the notion of the fairness doctrine of equal time for political candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.762" offset="10396463">And then, it is very significant I think that as a part of that amendment, Congress enacted these words, “Nothing in the foregoing sentence," that is the exception of bonafide new broadcast, "Nothing in the foregoing sentence shall be construed as relieving broadcasters in connection with the presentation of newscast, news interviews, news documentaries and on the spot coverage of news events from the obligation imposed upon them under this chapter to operate in the public interest and to afford reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting views on issues of public importance.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.919" offset="10593113">And the statute also provided in paragraph C, the commission shall prescribe appropriate rules and regulations to carry out the provisions of this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.293" offset="10646612">Since our brief was filed, I came across another related matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.563" offset="10667719">In 1960, Congress suspended the equal time provision for the 1960 presidential campaign only, and in that statute which was a temporary statute and therefore isn't included in the U.S. Code, there was this additional sentence, nothing in the foregoing shall be construed as relieving broadcasters from the obligation imposed upon them under this Act to operate in the public interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.954" offset="10801256">Now, as merely accumulative, it adds nothing to the provision that isn't Section 315, but it does show the continuing concern of Congress to maintain the requirement of operation in the public interest not as a mere private venture, which is the heart of the fairness doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.937" offset="10905119">Finally, some four years later, the commission put out a report which is called the fairness premier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.043" offset="10949632">As it appears in the federal register, it looks like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.544" offset="10971575">It is in essence, a digest of the decisions which the commission had reached in this area followed by two appendices which are reports of the commission and one of them is a report of the commission on editorializing by broadcast licensees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.300" offset="11054644">The other is a rather full and comprehensive history of the fairness doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.295" offset="11086618">And putting this out, the commission said, “It is the purpose of this public notice to advice broadcast licensees and members of the public of the rights, obligations, and responsibilities of such licensees under the commission's fairness doctrine, which is applicable in any case in which broadcast facilities are used for the discussion of a controversial issue of public importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.112" offset="11205841">Now, there is included in the fairness premier, digest of several cases which involved personal attacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.843" offset="11248786">And that is the source, not the chronological origin but the place where there is contained and in official publication, the then statement of the commission's views with respect to the particular application of the fairness doctrine which has come to be known as the personal attack doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="2819.424" offset="11383160">July 25, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.297" offset="11394654">I believe it's been put out in a different format as a pamphlet, but this is the way in which it appeared in the federal register for July 25, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.543" offset="11455572">Mr. Robb has stated the facts of the Red Lion case accurately, and I have no supplement to make the Red Lion station did broadcast a personal attack on Mr. Cook.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.971" offset="11521296">Mr. Cook sought an opportunity to reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.709" offset="11536238">He was told he could have it if he would pay for it or if he would certify that he was unable to pay for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.543" offset="11563614">Mr. Cook then wrote to the commission and there was an exchange of letters between the station and the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.110" offset="11609903">But the first question that arises in my mind on this is whether the case is really properly before the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.195" offset="11642190">Now, what is the order here?</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.188" offset="11662148">In the record, one will find two letters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.596" offset="11683777">One, incidentally, they both appear at least twice in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.311" offset="11702690">The letter of October 6, 1965 appears on page 9 and also on page 37.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.126" offset="11741874">That letter ends "Accordingly, you are requested to advice the commission of your plans to comply with the fairness doctrine applicable to the situation."</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.750" offset="11792447">The station then wrote back to the commission and on December 9th, the commission wrote a rather long letter discussing the legal questions, and I have the greatest difficulty finding that there was any order of any kind in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.971" offset="11869351">There may have been some indication that if the station didn't comply with this that when the time came for their license to be renewed, this would be a factor to be taken into account, but there was no order within any understanding that I have had with respect to the reviewability of administrative orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.170" offset="11962138">Indeed, the Court of Appeals panel first held that there was nothing reviewable here, but this was overturned by the Court of Appeals en banc without any opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.377" offset="12026922">And I would point out that this was in March 1967, a few months before this Court's decision in the Abbott Laboratories case, but I would mention in connection with that particularly before this Court's decision in the Toilet Goods Association against Gardner which was decided at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.404" offset="12119082">And it's very hard for me to see that this is a sort of order that should be reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.553" offset="12151683">Let me simply interject here that after the fairness premier was put out, the commission did have a formal rule making proceeding and did make rules on personal attack and political editorializing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.706" offset="12236215">Those rules are not involved in this case but they are the subject matter of the next case, Number 717.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.872" offset="12276861">In their brief in the next case, a counsel for their Radio Television News Directors Association say quote, “New York Times v. Sullivan governs this case”, just as simple as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.145" offset="12353975">If the New York Times case governs that case, I suppose it governs this one as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.418" offset="12387098">So, I would like to start with a consideration of the New York Times case and the differences between the problem there and here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.500" offset="12435372">The New York Times case was a newspaper case, a press case in the literal sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.661" offset="12476019">Now, we do not have a Federal Press Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.460" offset="12499216">We do have a Federal Communications Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.102" offset="12521785">We do not license newspapers, nor other elements of the printed media.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.999" offset="12557416">We do license radio and television stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.341" offset="12578732">It is inconceivable that we would undertake to enjoin a newspaper from publishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.195" offset="12610184">We can and would enjoin a radio or television station from operating if it did not have a license from the Federal Communications Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.434" offset="12659190">So, there must be some difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.845" offset="12676848">It obviously lies in the fact that radio and television exercise a privilege which is not utilized by the printed press.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.807" offset="12728675">Radio and television use a portion of the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.624" offset="12755947">They have and require exclusive use of a portion of the radio spectrum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.505" offset="12791474">Without their license, they would not be entitled to use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.632" offset="12811954">With their license, they are entitled to use it to the exclusion of everyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.587" offset="12839748">They not only have a grant of a portion of the public domain, they have a considerable measure of protection from competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.583" offset="12883738">In many communities, there is only one radio station or one television station.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.200" offset="12914249">Even when there are more as in the big cities, the protection from competition is substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.188" offset="12946223">As its evidence indeed by the prices in the tens of millions of dollars which are paid for a radio and television stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.750" offset="12988437">There can only be a limited number of very high frequency television stations and UHF or Ultra High Frequency is not yet very effective in competition, and similarly, the number of AM radio stations is limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.426" offset="13067118">Does the fact that radio and television can operate only when they are privilege to use a limited public facility mean that they are outside the protection of the First Amendment?</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.882" offset="13128976">Of course, that is not our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.815" offset="13144649">We are all guardians of the First Amendment, Government as well as broadcasters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.212" offset="13174220">The question to be determined is the application of the amendment in this particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.994" offset="13205358">There is a great effort here and in the following case to put us in the position of attacking the First Amendment and seeking to rescript -- restricted scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.811" offset="13252692">We do not accept such a position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.147" offset="13265962">We rely on the First Amendment and contend that our position is the one that makes it effective as against the narrow and I may say selfish interest of the broadcasters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.871" offset="13328865">The personal attack rules do not forbid anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.565" offset="13351643">The broadcaster can still put on whatever he wants to put on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.970" offset="13377348">The personal attack rules do not control the response.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.222" offset="13398350">They merely provide that there must be an opportunity for response.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.815" offset="13416636">In order that the listener may have the benefit of robust debate as a consequence of the publicly owned radio spectrum being used in the public interest, not merely as the exclusive private fee of the broadcaster.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.891" offset="13496989">In one of the briefs in the next case, Professor Harry Calvin is quoted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.031" offset="13533560">In this article, Professor Calvin says quote, “Think of a town meeting where the chair would rule that each speaker must be fair to both sides.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.720" offset="13600329">End of the quotation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.413" offset="13611092">And now, I like the town meeting analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.680" offset="13636169">I've taken part in a good many of them and they are remarkable example of democracy in action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.195" offset="13670233">But I think that Professor Calvin has misapplied the analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.309" offset="13694683">He has misapprehended the function and the opportunity and the responsibility of the moderator.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.248" offset="13742435">Let me put it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.418" offset="13755079">Think of a town meeting where the moderator did not see to it that both sides have full and fair and equal opportunity to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.567" offset="13799696">Can you imagine a moderator, who after one side have spoken in strong and fighting attack would then tell the opposition speaker, "No, you can't speak here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.263" offset="13854448">Perhaps you can get a hearing in some other town but not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.051" offset="13873674">He would not last long as a moderator.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.805" offset="13892692">The very essence of his post is to run the meeting in a fair manner; giving all relevant viewpoints or reasonable opportunity to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.440" offset="13947131">He does not control one side or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.178" offset="13966148">He does not censor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.190" offset="13978164">He does not force anyone to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.524" offset="13995510">And when someone wants to speak, he does not tel him what to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.520" offset="14019542">He keeps the channels of communication open.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.534" offset="14039604">He assures full debate as robust as the citizens want to make it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.849" offset="14072832">He sets the ground rules, but he does not control or take part or censor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.559" offset="14119643">Is this not a good analogy for the present case?</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.941" offset="14145139">It is the commission which is in the position of the moderator.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.589" offset="14171784">The commission does not control or take part or forbid or censor, but it does represent the public interest in assuring that the public facility is used for the public benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.785" offset="14248584">The personal attack rules do not rest on protection for the person attacked, they are for the benefit of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.335" offset="14290798">As a part of the overall fairness doctrine which is designed to make the First Amendment effective and which derives directly from the public ownership of the radio spectrum and the enactment of Congress that radio and television stations must operate for the public interest, convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.202" offset="14422246">This leads directly to the next portion of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.421" offset="14451085">It is said that application of the personal attack rules will inhibit radio and television operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.958" offset="14497270">And that they will prefer not to put on controversial programs because they will lose money if time has to be made available for a reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.137" offset="14557978">This, it seems to me begs the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.001" offset="14581384">As in many legal arguments, we are in this case I think very much at the risk of the tyranny of labels.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.944" offset="14621194">I've already referred to one aspect to this which might be put in the syllogism, major premise, the press cannot be required to adhere to a fairness rule, minor premise, radio and television are part of the press conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.761" offset="14684515">And therefore, radio and television cannot be subjected to the fairness rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.964" offset="14705309">As I've argued, the label is not applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.533" offset="14727565">And now on this point, we're subjected to the pressure of another label.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.917" offset="14749090">It is said that freedom of the press cannot be inhibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.096" offset="14769779">It would be inhibited if there were a personal attack rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.154" offset="14790050">Therefore, the personal attack rule must fall under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.709" offset="14816277">This I submit is in part pure assertion and in remaining part false reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.389" offset="14854938">There is no evidence whatever in this record that the Red Lion station was or would inhibited by the application of the personal attack doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.528" offset="14899555">In this very case, it went ahead and broadcast the attack after the commission had published the fairness premier in 1964 and it knew just what was expected of it by the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.612" offset="14963816">But beyond that as I've said, the argument is based on faulty analysis for it assumes that every minute of the time available to a broadcast licensee is his to use as he sees fit for his own personal financial profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.421" offset="15047095">But he isn't remains a licensee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.942" offset="15061201">He is using a public facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.562" offset="15075621">His license expressly provides that it must be used for the public convenience and interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.353" offset="15102788">If he does not meet the standard of the public interest, the commission may fail to renew his license, it can even cancel it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.975" offset="15137270">And I will continue tomorrow.</text>
