            <text syncTime="82.480" offset="433298">-- of the Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.040" offset="451584">Your Honors, it seems to us that the crux of this case, the real turning point when it might have gone the right way was on the motion by the appellants to dismiss made very promptly within a day or two after all of the criminal complaints in the state court had been dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.164" offset="544057">At that point, we submit to Your Honors, there was no case or controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.270" offset="568404">Anything more to be done was a simple matter of advice and advisory opinion and from the beginning of this nation to the present time, the teaching of this Court is there was no occasion, no reason, no right to go ahead and render an advisory opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.910" offset="658996">The Court insisted on so-called using the phrase “we will carry this motion with the case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="145.053" offset="683551">If it had faced up to the motion explicitly, what happened might not have happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.194" offset="728168">Now remember, if I may say as far as Dombrowski goes and I wish there were time for a full review of it although there has been so much rethinking and refreshing by the Court in any event, I doubt it would be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.323" offset="784697">But far from the facts here invoking Dombrowski where there was a bona fide allegation of deliberate, intentional, none of good faith used of the very complicated statute to effect racial repression far from those facts being involved here, and even assuming every disputed fact or anything that we can imagine was disputed here in favor of the appellees, this was a one-shot proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.747" offset="934327">This wasn't a continuing concert of effort to deprive anybody of his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.788" offset="954493">Instead of Dombrowski being controlling, I submit to you there are controlling words in Cameron against Johnson.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.123" offset="991901">If the mere possibility of erroneous application of the statute, the mere possibility of such erroneous application of the statute does not amount to the irreparable injury necessary to justify a disruption of orderly state procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="300.282" offset="1304534">But even within Golden, I would say would confirm, make more explicit of what I've said about the applicability of Cameron against Johnson.</text>

            <text syncTime="332.258" offset="1432430">Would that amounts to a case in controversy in your view?</text>

            <text syncTime="345.581" offset="1485720">But there was nothing here far from meeting the strong requirement of the very words of Dombrowski.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.069" offset="1515604">There wasn't even a serious claim that there was any concerted effort to keep --</text>

            <text syncTime="360.407" offset="1544965">There were no allegations of harassment or non-good faith application of the law, but the allegation is or suppose the allegation was that we know that the statute might be applied in these circumstances and we are now not holding anymore demonstrations or expressing our views at all because of the statute, and that gives us a case or controversy.</text>

            <text syncTime="841.133" offset="3467891">What actually happened was, the legislature did meet on June 4, 1968 in special session that was scheduled by the normal course of events to adjourn on July 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.790" offset="3538526">In the meanwhile, the state, the appellants here applied to His Honor, Mr. Justice Black, and he on June the 12 I believe entered a stay order which in effect superseded whatever the District Court's stay of mandate meant and actually, we are still today under that stay order.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.466" offset="3677288">I want to discuss what counsel says is the crux of the case that being the motion to dismiss and I'd like to put that in the context, if I may, of the events that led up to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.289" offset="3792541">This particular occurrence was on December the 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.848" offset="3822738">We filed our complaint by the 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.464" offset="3841233">The single-judge granted a temporary restraining order holding things in status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.561" offset="3881566">We also filed a motion for preliminary injunction and requesting the convening of the three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.699" offset="3914167">In January 2, the TRO was extended as I recall by agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.813" offset="3942588">On the 19, the defendant's filed an answer to the motion for injunction joining issue on our allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.780" offset="3982503">And on January the 23, the TRO was extended to February the 23 which was also the date of the hearing set for the three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.164" offset="4060035">So by January of 23, everybody had their pleadings in order and the three-judge court had been convened and the application for the preliminary injunction was then pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.874" offset="4134849">It was February 15, some two or three weeks later that for the first time, the motion to dismiss surfaced and was called to the attention of the Court in connection with a contemporaneously filed motion for a continuance seeking to have the Court put off the hearing that had already been scheduled on the pleadings and concentrate only on the motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.258" offset="4268387">The Court on February 20, three days before the previously scheduled hearing entered an order deferring the motion to dismiss or carrying it along with the case as we say down there and denying the motion for continuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.504" offset="4333380">And then on the 23, the hearing was held on which date incidentally and for the first time the defendant's filed any character of proof, this being in the form of affidavits from some of them and some of the deputies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.218" offset="4424286">I think and submit that the Court was entitled with respect to the motion dismissed to be very suspicious of the validity of the good faith, coming not only as a matter of time when it did, and in fact as I recall, the presiding judge, Judge Thornberry raised that very question during the hearing as to the timing of that motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.015" offset="4567437">If you thought he said, if you thought that these events had occurred on a federal enclave over which the state had no jurisdiction, why have you waited this long to call it to our attention?</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.815" offset="4622608">But in any event, the motion to dismiss if the Court please is directed only to that event.</text>

            <text syncTime="1230.615" offset="5025834">And the Court had this kind of evidence before it too which I think this Court can easily conclude that the District Court not only considered but was impressed by it to justify this kind of evidence, to justify the sworn testimony in the sense of affidavits, we agreed and the stipulation that those affidavits meant that those people given the affidavits if called to testify would testify in the fashion shown on the affidavits, this was all done by agreement for the convenience of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.850" offset="5198764">The appellees here, the three young men who were handled in Bell County as they were and other affiance called as witnesses through their affidavits, who were there also as a part of the demonstration, all said that they were limiting their activities in the committee it's peaceful protest that they would not return to Bell County, that they would not engage in any demonstrations in Bell County and some said elsewhere, so long as the statute was being used in the fashion that it was.</text>

            <text syncTime="1367.993" offset="5575346">The point that I'm trying to get to is to suggest to the Court that when the District Court accepted those statements not only by the appellees but by their witnesses who were there in the demonstration, they have very good reason for accepting him and believing him and get writing relief based on that or indicating that we were entitled to relief based on that.</text>
