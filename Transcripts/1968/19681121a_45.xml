            <text syncTime="70.316" offset="384606">These are two cases here on writs of certiorari to the United States Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.073" offset="407698">In each of them, the United States seeks reversal of judgments of that court granting back pay to former servicemen, each of whom had been discharged from the service pursuant to judgments of conviction of court-martials.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.578" offset="477706">In each of these cases, the United States urges that the Court of Claims lacks power to an effect constitute itself an additional appellate tribunal to review courts-martial for errors of law and therefore their judgment should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.238" offset="568299">Beyond the common question of law, neither of these cases has anything in common.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.436" offset="597138">In Augenblick, we have a conviction of a naval officer for an indecent -- commission of an indecent lewd and lascivious act and Juhl, the conviction for black market activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.781" offset="658474">In Augenblick, the Court of Claims in effect reversed the court-martial conviction and granted back pay because of a purported Jencks Act question.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.259" offset="704449">In Juhl, the court of claims purported to reverse a court-martial conviction and award back pay, because of a question of a conviction of Juhl's on what the Court of Claims said was self-contradictory, uncorroborated, accomplice testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.831" offset="782712">In other words, a mere evidentiary question.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.810" offset="798595">The United States says of the Court of Claims lacks to power to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.209" offset="820224">That the finality provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice providing for review of courts-martial ultimately by the Court of Military Appeals bars the Court of Claims from reviewing once again these judgments of conviction for factual Jencks Act questions and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.919" offset="907055">But that even if this Court finds that the Court of Claims has some measure of power to review courts-martial, no matter whether that power be broader or narrow, the Court of Claims was in error here.</text>

            <text syncTime="996.531" offset="4089501">I can conceive of a civilian being improperly tried, of course that may happen, but I think this Court has laid those questions to rest in many of its decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.110" offset="4143835">I think it's virtually impossible, if not utterly impossible having an improperly constituted Court because it is all laid out very clearly for the use of commanding officers who were generally advised by Judge advocates and certainly a legal review of patent defect of that character would ultimately reach a trained lawyer who would be able to advise his superior that such a Court Martial cannot stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.767" offset="4250415">I think, if you look at what the Court of Claims did here you can see at least the evils in giving them a very broad scope of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.964" offset="4287195">I'd like to turn to the facts, each of these cases briefly to show that really these are cases in which this Court has injected itself into the appellate proceedings unnecessarily and I think even under the broadest review improperly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.993" offset="4351352">In Augenblick for example, as I said we have a reported Jencks Act question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.772" offset="4378415">Augenblick was accused of committing an natural sex act with one airman Hodges and airman Hodges was interrogated by naval intelligence officers and purportedly a tape recording of his conversation was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.148" offset="4451976">When it came for trial, his tape recording had disappeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.377" offset="4472874">Contrary to what I think respondent Augenblick's brief says, a very full and adequate hearing was afforded at the Court Martial to try to find out what had happened to that tape.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.951" offset="4527208">The government voluntarily produced eight witnesses, each of whom testified before the Court Martial as to what precisely they knew about the tape, leading to the conclusion that if one had been made and it probably had, one; the tape recording device might have failed because in an other time, a partially garbled transcript was obtained, but at worst the tape had reached an opposite naval intelligence investigator who had by accident allowed the tape to be erased when it was used to records someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.982" offset="4675271">The reason that this tape was sought supposedly was to investigate whether an alleged promise had been made to airman Hodges that if he testified against Augenblick, he would receive an honorable discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.172" offset="4728038">But at his Court Marital his own defense counsel has conceded that this couldn't have happened because after all Hodges was in the air force and he was being interrogated by naval intelligence, civilian inspectors and even an airman wouldn't expect that a navy man could promise him an honorable discharge from his own service, so this had been conceded away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.944" offset="4815182">And moreover we had a case of harmless error, because while Hodges had testified to the indecent act actually taking place, two police officers had seen the act, but at seeing something related to it which was well not the act, indecent and lascivious conduct and the Court convicted him only of the indecent and lascivious conduct, not of actually committing the unnatural act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1520.443" offset="6185148">No Commander Augenblick is the sexual offense, he has been dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.869" offset="6202807">Juhl, who was the enlisted man who was found guilty of black marketeering was merely reduced in rate and fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.747" offset="6230392">And this of course brings before us the question of the scope of the Court of Military Appeals, powers of review and it has the power to review Courts-martial when there is a sentence in excess of one year or when there is in the case of an officer dismissal from the service which is how Augenblick got at least to the point where they decided not to hear it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.424" offset="6333106">And in the case of an enlisted man if he gets a bad conduct or dishonorable discharge, he than can have a review by the Court of Military Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.600" offset="6377723">Furthermore I analogized here review powers to certiorari in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.394" offset="6396949">I believe they -- when they deny a review, they're in effect doing a bit more than the mere denial of writ of certiorari because if they fail to find good cause they can decline to review it, so they at least have to look at a record to determine whether there is good cause shown for review, which I believe tends to be a stronger action than the mere denial of a writ of certiorari by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.756" offset="6510425">I was, at the close on my argument reviewing briefly the facts in Augenblick to show you what the Court of Claims is really doing here and I stated that they had heard eight witnesses to determine what had happened to these tape recordings that at most what was found was that the tape had been inadvertently re-used, that the witness Hodges really, his testimony was not that upon which Augenblick was convicted, but rather that a police officer so even if the defense did not have the statement of Hodges and even if the statement that he made was wholly inconsistent with his testimony or trial, the error would have been harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.941" offset="6683146">Further a Board of Review heard the Augenblick case on the Jencks Act question, studied it thoroughly and issued a rather lengthy opinion, a dissenting opinion on the very Jencks Act question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.700" offset="6742183">And yet the Court of Claims elevated this whole question into one of constitutionality I think, which is how they justified their taking of the case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.682" offset="6790144">And I think this is one of the evils of giving the Court of Claims, a broad scope of review of Court-martial because they just go ahead to go into these facts, they're going to look at lengthy records, do something which in effect the defendant and the Court-martial already has done for him by Congressional mandate to what a fair chance at having his conviction reversed for errors of the type that was present in Augenblick.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.903" offset="6890977">Juhl is an even more striking example of why the Court of Claim should be kept out of this area, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.383" offset="6924936">In Juhl the question was whether his accomplice was the sole reason he was convicted and if so whether that accomplice's testimony was self contradictory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.025" offset="6975509">And this question the Court of Claims in its own opinion elevated to one of jurisdiction of the Court-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.987" offset="6999333">If you have accomplice's testimony and use it improperly this deprives the Court-martial jurisdiction, is the way the Court of Claims justified its action in Juhl.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.708" offset="7042173">Now here's what happened, Hughes was the accomplice of Mr. Juhl and he testified that together, Mr. Juhl and I are engaged in black market activities by buying goods from a PX and we were privileged to do it in England and selling it to civilians at considerable profit to ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.649" offset="7117928">Other witnesses which, I would think any civilian Court would conclude were corroborative, testified that at one point Mr. Juhl had gone into the PX and bought a lot of extra cigarettes or cigars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.044" offset="7175502">Another witness placed Mr. Juhl at the scene where an admitted sale by Hughes of black market cigars to civilian, English civilians had taken place, he didn't show Juhl actually participating when he was at least there, which I certainly would suggest his corroboration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.328" offset="7244675">And the wife of Hughes saw Mr. -- wife of Mr. Hughes the accomplish saw defendant Juhl at one point coming out of a building with a large roll of English currency, after a black market transaction had apparently taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.600" offset="7317817">The Court of Claims not only looked at the accomplice testimony and said it was self contradictory and uncorroborated, but they said that this was jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.203" offset="7372152">Why was it jurisdictional, because it -- somewhat it seemed fit to have a separate chapter in the rules relating to accomplice testimony and they -- from this, they concluded that it was thought so important the accomplice testimony was that if you don't properly charge it, you can't base a conviction on and it's jurisdictional a bootstrap argument if I ever had one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.863" offset="7474866">I might add also that in Juhl we had an actual waiver of an instruction on accomplice testimony, which was offered to the defense because the defense counsel, when the law officer of the General Court-Martial said, “Do you want an instruction on accomplice testimony?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.284" offset="7540485">Replied, “No, I don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.075" offset="7547695">It's not the theory of our defense, it's not important to our defense.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.545" offset="7565563">That's why I submit to this court that our position which may seem to be a harsh one that even for a lack of jurisdiction in the court-martial, the Court of Claims is foreclosed from review, is not as harsh as it may sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.048" offset="7635571">Because of the provisions for adequate review of these court-martial on the part with civilian lawyers when anything, really damaging to a defendant takes place, lengthy imprisonment, dismissal, dishonorable discharge, bad conduct discharge, he is protected, I submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.533" offset="7713520">Congress has seen to it that he is protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.528" offset="7725432">Secondly, if the Court of Claims is going to assume jurisdiction of these cases and elevate the very close, I don't even think it's close Jencks Act question in Augenblick to a constitutional question of the first magnitude or take accomplice testimony of a simple question where I think the Court of Claims was clearly wrong and was even waived by the defendant and say this is a jurisdictional defect in the court-martial, you are going to have every single court-martial that results in affirmance by at any point in the line brought to the Court of Claims and one final effort for one final reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.646" offset="7885928">This is something that is contrary to good sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.431" offset="7901080">I think it's contrary to discipline in the services and it's not necessary for the protection of accused persons, habeas corpus exists in the really serious situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2007.934" offset="8135137">Answering an earlier question Mr. Justice Harlan as to whether if article 76 did not exist, would we be taking this position here in court? The answer is no, that the Court of Claims had purported to exercise the power to review courts-martial for lack of jurisdiction in the past and I would concede that absent article 76 today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.642" offset="8245896">Once again, I believe this would be a very limited effect because of the rarity of a properly constituted courts-martial because for any type of offense today, legal advice is available to the convening authority can pose the court on the rules for how to constitute court-martial are very clearly laid out, and having dealt with them in my military career before I had gone through a last couple of events, so that a layman can understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.022" offset="8363447">I don't believe there is any need for this court to expand the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims even to areas where on habeas corpus of District Court could review a court-martial that is for in addition to jurisdiction, constitutional defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.384" offset="8428857">Once again in order to bootstrap itself into giving Augenblick and Juhl back pay, the Court of Claims elevated these rather elementary and, questions of certainly not constitutional law into constitutional questions in order to -- for reasons of its own grant pay to these men.</text>

            <text syncTime="4294.629" offset="17281860">It went to the burden approved being put on the wrong party when a Jencks material is not produced, the failure to conduct in a camera examination of admitted notes, admitted Jencks materials, the failure to incorporate those notes into the record so that anybody the Court of Military Appeals or anybody else could review it and a failure to call a key witness to determine what happened to these States.</text>

            <text syncTime="4374.936" offset="17603166">Now some consideration is not fair consideration, and when rules of law are completely misstated, I don't believe that any court would determine that this is fair consideration and I would say that on the facts of this case, the constitutional issue has been raised in these Jencks Act violations, that the legislative history indicates that the Court of Claims neither in 1948 or 1950 was exercised in this jurisdiction, nothing was said about them and point of fact the only thing was said what to the effect -- was to the effect in a report that was filed in the congressional record that the Court of Claims jurisdiction remained and under those circumstances this court cannot deprive servicemen of the right to come to this Court by silence and by implication.</text>

            <text syncTime="5261.866" offset="21150804">In the first place, one under the correction statute the secretary can attack a court-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5272.097" offset="21191764">In other words Section 76 of the Finality Clause says that these -- this decision on a court-martial will be final on all officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5282.441" offset="21233142">But then they come along with the correction statute where the Secretary wants to correct them to save Congress from making private bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="5289.069" offset="21259682">So the Mr. Francis J. Steiner General rules and the government agree the Secretary can than collaterally attack the court-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5297.631" offset="21293850">The Secretary can do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5299.947" offset="21303150">Now the decision of the Secretary is just final on officers, it's not final on Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5306.848" offset="21330735">All the decisions of the Secretary under the Correction Board can be reviewed by the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="5312.378" offset="21352887">There is no basis in the legislative history or any other thing to show that they could not review a court-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5326.378" offset="21408893">Nowhere does it say that and the government admits that the Secretary can collaterally attack it, that's an exception to Section 76.</text>
            <text syncTime="5334.233" offset="21440345">And the statute under which he does it is only final on officers, it's not final on courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5340.518" offset="21465422">So under the correction statute he has a right to be reviewed in the Court of Claims under this, nowhere does it say otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="5351.317" offset="21508681">But even the Section 76 found, and I believe under the decisions of this Court in Estep versus U.S. and the Harmon v. Brucker case, we had other statutes which had finality provisions in them, there was a finality provision in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5367.996" offset="21575346">And the Court looked at this in effect as a final legal order.</text>
            <text syncTime="5377.729" offset="21614320">They can make a final legal order, they don't consider all orders final, just only the final legal order.</text>

            <text syncTime="6420.372" offset="25784822">In this brief, our position that legislative history of the statute establishing the court provides that there maybe judicial review under appropriate circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="6432.556" offset="25833618">The government I feel certainly would take the position that if the underlying action being reviewed by the board was a court-martial that the finality clause of Article 76 would bar judicial review of the board's decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="6453.723" offset="25918255">In light of this history, we are confident that the finality provision as it now exists quoting it “a correction under this section is finally conclusive on all offices of the United States, was not intended to conclude any otherwise proper judicial review of the departmental action upon a petition to change by petitioner”.</text>

            <text syncTime="6505.879" offset="26126921">Here no, but I said if the question arose again whether the board for the correction of records could be reviewed in court when they have corrected a court-martial, we would urge that Article 76 bars judicial review of that board Ashe.</text>
            <text syncTime="6521.373" offset="26188884">Yeah, finally in conclusion I would like to I think place this case in respect to both these cases by saying that I think we are all concerned about probably is whether a military defendant has access at some point to a civilian court to make sure that he was not convicted on fundamentally unfair grounds by fundamentally unfair procedures and briefly these are the instances under which a military defendant can at some point get civilian review by a civilian court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6554.700" offset="26322213">He is imprisoned over one year; he can go to the Court of Military Appeals or of course habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="6561.899" offset="26350947">He is dismissed from the service as was Augenblick; it's a bad conduct or dishonorable discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="6568.355" offset="26376756">He is an enlisted man; he can go to the Court of Military Appeals, which is a civilian court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6575.073" offset="26403715">If he is imprisoned for less than one year, truly must act promptly, but he can seek the remedy of habeas corpus and that remedy has been made much more meaningful by this court, because even if he has properly applied for that writ, even though his imprisonment is over and he has served his term, this court has recently held in the Carafus v. LaVallee case that he can pursue his habeas remedy and have his conviction expunged.</text>
            <text syncTime="6602.621" offset="26513847">Therefore, only in the petty area where a fine is imposed or a reduction in pay takes place is he foreclosed by review by habeas or the Court of Military Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="6613.395" offset="26557001">I think that this situation shows that fundamentally the position the government has urged is fair, thank you.</text>
