            <label>Mr. Charles Alan Wright</label>
            <text syncTime="40.810" offset="266637">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.032" offset="291506">The issue here is whether or not a state is excuse from the duty that would otherwise be upon it to give a speedy trial to a person it has indicted on the state charge because that person is during pendency of the indictment in the federal penitentiary on some other charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.632" offset="369873">The Texas Supreme Court in a consistent line of cases has ruled that it is not that although it is bound to give a speedy charge to a person under Texas indictment who was under -- who was in a Texas prison that it is not required as some other sovereign to produce a prisoner in order that may try him.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.003" offset="455346">I propose to spend unless the Court has its questions on the matter very little time on the merits in part because I do not think that there is an issue as between my friends for the state and myself on the underlying constitutional principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.828" offset="518666">I do not find such an issue drawn in the brief and I believe that Mr. Moss speaks for the respondent that it will appear that we agree on the basic constitutional point.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.081" offset="563702">Now, of course the agreement of counsel can't put an authoritative construction on the Constitution of the United States but I would think that on the substantive point, your decision last term speaking through Justice Marshall in the case of Page versus Barber is quite decisive that the problem decided in Page and Barber is really indistinguishable from the problem of this case presents that where someone who is needed for a criminal proceeding is in the custody of some other sovereign that at least the state has the duty to make a reasonable effort to endeavor to getting back from the prison in which he presently languishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.661" offset="746036">A reasonable effort is all that Page and Barber requires to solve that we contend for us the rule in this case since it is I think quite clear here that Texas has made no effort to get this petitioner back from Leavenworth.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.512" offset="801416">I do want to call to the Court's attention a study of this matter that it is not referred to an either of the briefs because it has become available only very recently and that is a 63-page national survey of detainers prepared by the National Defender Project of the National Legal Aid and Defender Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.822" offset="886680">That Association made copies available both to counsel for the respondent and to myself and I'm sure would be glad to make copies of their very comprehensive survey available to the Court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Alan Wright</label>
            <text syncTime="218.887" offset="978944">There is an issue between my friends and myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.531" offset="997543">I'm not sure whether it goes to substance or to procedure that has to do with the effect of the solvency of a person under the state charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.928" offset="1043101">The state makes the argument that they do not know when the present petitioner became indigent and that since the indictment that they returned against him in 1960 alleged that he had recently acquired by theft some $42,000.00 unless he notified them that he were indigent, they would have no reason to know that he was indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.909" offset="1135052">And therefore, no reason to think that he could not finance his own way to Houston in order to stand trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.847" offset="1162742">The -- in the view that petitioner submits of that the fact is of his indigency is irrelevant that the obligation to give a speedy trial extends as well to a prisoner or in person under indictment who is rich as it does to one who is without funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.667" offset="1246020">It's a little hard to see, in fact, what good it would have done the petitioner if he had had funds the states says, “Well, we would've given him a trial within two weeks anytime he showed up in Houston.”</text>
            <text syncTime="297.833" offset="1294712">And if he'd the money to pay his way from Leavenworth to Houston and it said to himself, “Oh, I think I would go down to Houston and stand trial.”</text>
            <text syncTime="305.848" offset="1326791">I imagine that the federal prison authorities at Leavenworth would've taken a rather deem view of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.833" offset="1350719">That they would not have allowed him to go unless the state had made an effort, we're told in memorandum of the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.429" offset="1381125">But ordinarily, the policy of the Bureau of Prisons is to require a writ of habeas corpus at prosequendum from the state court and that when that comes, the Bureau then is very cooperative and almost invariably will make the prisoner available.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.285" offset="1448521">But it isn't the fact that Mr. Smith did or did not have funds that in my submission is significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.052" offset="1479555">It is the fact the he was confined by the federal authorities and that some request from the state authorities was necessary before the federal authorities would let him out of the walls of Leavenworth to go to Houston to stand trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.623" offset="1537860">There are obvious problems in this case because the record is not very frequent.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.189" offset="1568162">I'm very aware of that from the outset of the case and the state suggest in its brief because of the skimpiness of the record it -- this Court either should dismiss the writ as improvidently granted or should remand the case to the -- either the Texas Supreme Court or state trial court for further fact findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.510" offset="1669413">I submit however that the record skimpy as it is presents every fact that is necessary for decision of the comparatively narrow issue that the case presents that it would be nice to have a good deal of background to this day, though I'm his counsel do not know on what federal offense my client was convicted but I can't think it really makes any difference whether he was in Leavenworth on one crime or another that these are matters of color only.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.956" offset="1815176">And that the basic legal facts are perfectly clear in the record that he was indicted in April of 1960 in Harris County for a crime allegedly committed in May of 1959 that as of that time he was a federal prisoner that the Sheriff of Harris County wrote to Leavenworth and was advised that he would not be released until 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.952" offset="1911202">The beginning at least in March of 1961, the petitioner has made repeated request to have a speedy trial that he has not been brought on for trial at any time that there has now a lapse some eight years and that the time is long since past when it is possible to give the petitioner the kind of trial to which he's constitutionally entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.279" offset="2012453">So that in our submission, the writ was providently granted and the record is ample to decide the matter that is before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.219" offset="2068250">The record in addition to being skimpy is somewhat informal.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.371" offset="2084864">The petitioner addressed his writ of mandamus in the state court to a non-existent court, the Texas Criminal Court of Appeals and it was transferred by that court informally to the Texas Supreme Court as the Texas Supreme Court has jurisdiction in these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.727" offset="2158320">The Texas Supreme Court entered no formal order instead the administrative assistant to the court wrote to the petitioners saying that the, “Your petitioners today have been denied” Referring to the Cooper case and the Lawrence case as authority for the denial.”</text>
            <text syncTime="530.194" offset="2224149">But the mere fact of informality in the state court proceedings does not mean that we have any less a final judgment of the highest court of the state in which decision can be had.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.149" offset="2272005">I refer and hold the case of In re Summers for example in 325 F.2d in which was a letter from the Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.140" offset="2311920">That the Secretary of the Illinois Bar Committee that was the definitive action of the Illinois Court and this Court held nonetheless that it had -- that that letter was a sufficient -- were definitive act to permit review under Section 1257.</text>

            <text syncTime="568.780" offset="2378480">Mr. Wright, the record, fit as it is does seem to show that your client was told that he could be tried within two weeks anytime he made himself available that --</text>

            <text syncTime="593.940" offset="2479104">He indicates that if the prisoner himself if somebody situated as is your client himself requested the Bureau of Prisons will arrange to make him available for a state court trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.607" offset="2529782">I'm referring to the -- a full paragraph in the middle of page 33 and he further says that the petitioner did not request any assistance from the United States Bureau of Prison in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="651.629" offset="2709922">But that a prisoner not later than law can hardly be expected to know that this procedure was available.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.104" offset="2743777">He was doing but to him where the obvious things.</text>

            <text syncTime="671.909" offset="2791006">That under the published rules of the Board of Prisons, the prisoner is not advised that, “If you'll ask us we will come to your assistance.”</text>
            <text syncTime="684.742" offset="2842311">Instead the rules speak only that a prisoner will ordinary be made available if the state authorities requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.560" offset="2869582">And I think that it would be asking a good deal to say that the petitioner has waived any right he had because he did not pursue a remedy that even a reasonably observant person would not have known existed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joe S. Moss</label>
            <text syncTime="874.685" offset="3602160">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.735" offset="3618356">There is absolutely no issue here about the right of this petitioner to a speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.242" offset="3640299">I, as a representative of the prosecution in the concerned jurisdiction, Harris County of the State of Texas, have long thought that it's absolutely outrageous to keep things like this hanging over the heads of prisoners who are incarcerated under the jurisdiction of other sovereigns whether it be a state or other federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.791" offset="3734549">Likewise, I fully realize as Your Honors have noticed in some of your recent opinions that it is a matter of common knowledge that people charge with crime rarely want a trial at all and if they must have one they hardly ever want it to be speedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.310" offset="3808632">Delay as it operates to the disadvantage of the prosecution and to the advantage of the defendant petitioner here because the memories of witnesses dimmed and that necessarily affects the burden that the prosecution must bear in establishing the guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.346" offset="3904763">Bearing that in mind, we are here today concerned with a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.930" offset="3943111">We are going to try to find out if the failure of this man to have a speedy trial has denied him his constitutional rights and if it has the next question is, did he waive it?</text>
            <text syncTime="976.255" offset="4008417">As we know is being done everyday in cases generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.701" offset="4026180">As an illustration from Harris County, Texas, there are probably 40 or 50 arrests a day made on the basis of searches and seizure without a warrant where the person affected give his consent to the search and seizure which is of the Constitution of our country not required to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.621" offset="4105906">He waived his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.475" offset="4113324">In this case, did he waive it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.499" offset="4125341">Ewell by this Court some three years ago says, whether the delay alone amounts to the constitutional deprivation of the right, it's a matter to be determined in the first instance in the trial court that any argument to the contrary in this Court is premature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.528" offset="4201514">And that this Court would not pass on it until such time as the sentencing judge in the lower court had heard the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.444" offset="4241115">In this case, the record -- let me say has been prepared by stipulation only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.821" offset="4266611">And I certainly compliment the gentleman at the great effort he has made to get it here and I've agreed with him on every term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.993" offset="4295346">Not one time have I disagreed with any stipulation he wanted, not at one time has he disagreed with any the highest court, even as late as today in order to correct an understatement in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.928" offset="4343097">The prosecuting authorities of the State of Texas never knew anything about this procedure in the Supreme Court or in the misnamed Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas until after the application for writ of certiorari was filed in this Court; the Supreme Court of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.923" offset="4415091">If you read the records, you will find that the denial of the relief in the Supreme Court of Texas was on June the 21st last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.047" offset="4455528">I mean it was filed, the petition was filed then and the denial was on the 28th and I have a notice in my file here to show in counsel that it wasn't actually mailed down there until injunction of case worker from the penitentiary cede it on June the 22nd.</text>

            <text syncTime="1107.480" offset="4533269">What was the writ -- what was the action of law -- in the -- this was a petition for writ of mandamus?</text>

            <label>Mr. Joe S. Moss</label>
            <text syncTime="1113.150" offset="4555943">Yes sir, to mandamus to trial judge to dismiss the indictment because he have not a speedy trial after seven years which he in truth and in fact have not had it and which he in truth and in fact was entitled to if he had not waived it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.710" offset="4618219">Now, so we know that five or six days elapsed between the time that this thing was filed in the Supreme Court of Texas and the decision came down and we have no notice on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.359" offset="4668792">In August of the same year, the petition was filed up here and we did get notice of it and also at that time of the former proceedings in the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.027" offset="4715499">Let me say that in the appendix here prepared by eminent counsel, the petition itself has contained in the appendix does not show that you verified and it does not show that contains an affidavit of indigency or poverty as we call it in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.782" offset="4782477">The Texas courts hold indigency the same as it is to one else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.642" offset="4797942">There is no price on the remedies down there, but he must make this oath and in this particular case, he did not do so even though in my brief with the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.479" offset="4845275">I invite the attention of the Court to the facts that the copy furnish me in my office did contain this affidavit and did contain the verification of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.428" offset="4893132">But that was not sufficient to put jurisdiction into the courts of Texas to prosecute him for perjury by merely giving me a copy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.990" offset="4927300">It has to be filed in the Court which he studiously avoided doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.786" offset="4946526">And that is significant because he knew if he had done that that's exactly what we would've done to him because we know of $42,000.00 he had in green banks and other matters that are not in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.872" offset="4998875">Even the sentence he served at the present time is -- we had his counsel said, we don't know what that is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.677" offset="5026043">We're not concerned with it but what are we going to do about it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.683" offset="5054151">If this petitioner had been tried in Texas at any time rather than a mistrial only three things could happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.943" offset="5083094">He could be acquitted, he can be filed guilty and his sentence ran concurrent with the federal sentence, or he could have been filed guilty and the sentence has been cumulated with the federal sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.955" offset="5127189">In the brief as the member of the Bar of this Court I respectfully represent this Court cumulation is rarely done by the judges in Harris County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.132" offset="5155924">It has to be an extreme matter before it's done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.258" offset="5168358">But in Ewell this Court said, they'll take that up later on and see what the judge does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.386" offset="5188942">So, with approximately five more years jurisdiction of the custody of this prisoner vested in the federal authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.068" offset="5223633">It conceivably could be that he would receive a sentence that would be expired by the time the federal government gets through with it and be release and have no more even if we try to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.222" offset="5264280">Likewise, the converse is true if we wait until the five years and then try it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.286" offset="5288521">Under the law of Texas, if he received 10 years which is the maximum he could receive under the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.268" offset="5312449">The trial judge has the discretion to give him credit for the time he is already served in some other penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.888" offset="5338885">And you can see if he did that which I represent to this Court is almost always uniformly done then he has not suffered any loss of any right; constitutional or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.758" offset="5386428">On the other hand, if it is cumulated then the serious question comes up and as we said in your -- that should be decided whether that has having the effect on it should be decided after the trial judge has had a shot at him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.174" offset="5452048">Now, as to when we get him and try him can only be one of two occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.844" offset="5478797">It can be while he is in the custody of United States and let us see what that's going to intake expenses with two marshals down there in back exact words of it being for the subsistence and shelter of the prisoner and the deputy marshals during the entire time of their absence from headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.990" offset="5579316">As Mr. Justice White observed that if what State of Texas cannot afford to do they just don't have the money but I think in all candor --</text>

            <text syncTime="1601.466" offset="6509275">I might say in all fairness, it's about a two day delay because of what I call the inefficiency in our old office, but anyhow we got them about the same time in August of 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.030" offset="6543444">We immediately responded to their petition, sent a copy to the Solicitor General and to the Attorney General with the thought that both of these people, bearing in mind that this petitioner is jointly invalid with one of his co-defendants, named Taylor who is in the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary and seeks no relief, he don't want to plea for trial, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.009" offset="6623378">The Attorney General gave us both, so we wouldn't have to have two trials, we might try them all at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.903" offset="6646993">My solution to this thing in the prayer that I respectfully present to you is that this be remanded to the state court in some fashion, either to the Supreme Court to develop the facts and get them up here so we can understand what rights he may have been denied, whether it's the absence of witnesses or the unlikelihood of contrary of sentences of what it may be or if that's not satisfactory with the court that it be remanded in some fashion back to the trial court with the instructions to the State of Texas to try him within the reasonable length of time, even if they do have to spend the money.</text>

            <text syncTime="1688.281" offset="6856495">But that does not give the state courts authority to indict him and try him for perjury which is what we would do because he that man has got the money, and did have it, and we want to know what the law of Texas what's become of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1757.831" offset="7134647">That has no bearing on his guilt of the theft his charged with, it has bearing on the fact that he has committed a fraud upon this Supreme Court of Texas by sending a petition down there without any affidavit of indigency, and then file in one up here where we clearly have no jurisdiction of prosecuting a perjury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2957.072" offset="11931669">But this would be the minimum you would do, and then the state court freed from the compulsion of erroneous view of federal law might be free to decide for itself whether or not it wants to order dismissal or whether it wants to leave prejudice still in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.239" offset="12000319">I don't think that is all that this Court has the power to do or appropriately could do on this record.</text>

            <text syncTime="2992.720" offset="12074297">And I think that whether or not a showing of prejudice is required or whether or not untoward delay at some point become so bad as simply by itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="3055.002" offset="12323401">I have no doubt in the light of what Mr. Moss has told us that thereafter persons in this situation in Harris County would be given a speedy trial.</text>
