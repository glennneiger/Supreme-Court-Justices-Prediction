            <label>Mr. Maurice J. McCarthy</label>
            <text syncTime="3.395" offset="116903">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4.316" offset="120665">Maurice J. McCarthy appearing on behalf of the petitioner, William J. McCarthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.501" offset="137383">I'm sure that the question has occurred to the Court as well, cleared up initially the petitioner and I are not related, the fact that we have the same last name is purely coincidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.486" offset="177298">The facts in this case are not complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.454" offset="197151">On April 1, 1966, a three-count indictment was returned against the petitioner charging income tax evasion under Section 7201 of the Internal Revenue Code and alleging that there were deficiencies and taxes of approximately $900.00 for the year 1959, $5,000.00 for the year 1960, and $1,200.00 for the year 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.711" offset="310209">On April 14, 1966, the petitioner appeared in the District Court with retained counsel and at that time counsel waived the reading of the indictment and entered a plea of not guilty to each of the three counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.369" offset="376874">The court set the trial for the 13th of June 1966, thereafter, which the record does not disclose the trial was reset for June 30, 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.916" offset="439045">On June 29, 1966, Government counsel appearing ex parte informed the court that the petitioner's illness made it impossible to try the case and asked for a continuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.361" offset="492857">The district judge reset the case to the 15th of July.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.199" offset="512188">On the 15th of July the petitioner, again occurring with retained counsel appeared for the trial of the case at that time counsel for the petitioner informed the court that he would like to withdraw the plea of not guilty to count 2 of the indictment and to offer a plea of guilty to that count which was the allegation of approximately $500.00 in unpaid taxes for the year 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.521" offset="637471">The court interrogated counsel for the Government who indicated that upon the plea of guilty, the acceptance of the plea of guilty rather, the Government counsel would move to dismiss counts 1 and 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.948" offset="699120">The circuit -- the district judge at that time questioned the defendant personally as to two matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.205" offset="728168">First of all, he asked the defendant in the trial level, if he was aware that by pleading guilty, he waived his right to a jury trial the defendant responded in the affirmative.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.346" offset="776756">He then asked concerning the statutory penalties of five years imprisonment and a maximum five-year imprisonment and a maximum $10,000 fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.148" offset="827956">Upon receiving affirmative responses, the district judge entered a finding of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.048" offset="855542">At this point, the Government counsel asked the district judge to inquire of the defendant whether any threats or premises had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.234" offset="892322">The district judge did inquire and received negative responses that no threats had been made and no promises had been given.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.702" offset="930147">No further questioning was had either of the defendant or of retained counsel and the case was set for a sentencing hearing in September 1966 on September 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.061" offset="991587">At that time, the petitioner again appeared with retained counsel and the district judge in the elocution procedure as the defendant personally if he had anything to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.408" offset="1048952">The defendant response was that if it were not for his health and the things that he had gone through, that had never would have happen and that it was not deliberate.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.623" offset="1097853">No further questions were asked of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.556" offset="1113631">The petitioner's counsel at that time was present and the District Court directed its attention to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.497" offset="1145396">He was asked if he had a statement and he made a brief statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.692" offset="1162115">The court then indicated that in view of the size of the amount involved that the debtor in effect of the sentence was necessary and entered a sentence of one year imprisonment and a fine of a $2,500.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.063" offset="1223659">Counsel for the petitioner on the District Court level then asked to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.783" offset="1246542">He addressed the district judge and informed the district judge of the facts concerning the character of the defendant himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.165" offset="1288025">He indicated to the court that the defendant was at that time of the proceedings, 65 years old that he had never been familiar with any federal offense of any sort that he had a fine family.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.749" offset="1354376">He further informed the court that the defendant had just recently approximately two months prior to the sentencing hearing which was at approximately the same time as the tender of the plea of guilty that the petitioner had become a member of Alcoholics Anonymous because he had been an acute alcoholic for some time.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.694" offset="1454164">He further informed the court that at the time that the crime was allegedly committed, that being the time of the filing of the Income Tax Return that the petitioner had been involved in what counsel called a protracted drinking situation from which he was hospitalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.374" offset="1532844">No questions concerning this matter were asked of the counsel for the defendant in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.317" offset="1572655">Counsel then spoke of the nature of the crime and of the evidence that was present or inherently present on the district court level.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.290" offset="1616541">His exposition of the crime consisted in saying that the books of the defendant had been negligently kept and that this negligence amounted to one, it became gross amounted to criminal intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.054" offset="1687594">The -- there was not questioning concerning the exposition of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.988" offset="1711313">The probation officer then informed the court that the Alcoholic Anonymous sponsor of the defendant was present in open court and available to testify concerning those matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.743" offset="1778395">The District Court did no take any testimony or confer with the sponsor from Alcoholics Anonymous.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.933" offset="1811101">The District Court then refused to vacate or suspend sentence and entered a state of execution for approximately 15 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.432" offset="1853106">The argument of the petitioner presents three questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.736" offset="1874317">First of these questions concerns Federal Rule 11 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure which was amended effective July 1, 1966 since this plea was tendered on July 15, 1966, it is governed by the rule as amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.593" offset="1949759">That amendment and the notes of the Advisory Committee to this Court concerning the addition of the ordering in the rule which constitute the amendment is critical in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.607" offset="2005765">The amendment required that the District Court addressed the defendant personally rather than what had been practiced in the past of allowing the Court to addressed counsel for the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.310" offset="2064593">In this case, there was no questioning of the petitioner other than on the merits which I have stated and in the exposition of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.562" offset="2097612">Our contention is that Amended Rule 11 directs and demands that the district judge inquire personally of the defendant as to his understanding of the nature of the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.721" offset="2158216">This was never done.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.369" offset="2164799">We therefore contend that at the time of the acceptance of the plea of guilty on July 15, 1966, error was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.547" offset="2205550">We contend that this error was compounded at the sentencing hearing which occurred in September 1966 in that certain facts were brought to the attention of the District Court which required inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.119" offset="2275871">We have cited in our brief to this Court the universal opinion of the lower courts, the circuit courts that Rule 11 imposes on the district judge a duty of inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.801" offset="2334595">We feel that in view of the facts presented to the district judge, this duty of inquiry was very right and yet no inquiry was had of the defendant personally or even of his counsel for that matter or the other persons who were available to give information.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="574.679" offset="2402095">What is the provision in Rule 11 on which you rely for that last argument?</text>

          <turn speaker="maurice_j_mccarthy" startTime="582.816" stopTime="599.145">
            <label>Mr. Maurice J. McCarthy</label>
            <text syncTime="582.816" offset="2434591">The -- there is no provision in Rule 11 concerning a duty of inquiry but the provision in Rule 11 is that the district judge must address the defendant personally and determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.153" offset="2491956">I draw from this the conclusion.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="599.145" stopTime="601.401">
            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="599.145" offset="2500002">In determining that the plea is made voluntarily?</text>

            <label>Mr. Maurice J. McCarthy</label>
            <text syncTime="601.401" offset="2508988">Voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.673" offset="2530095">I draw from this the conclusion and I support it with case law in briefs that there is a duty of inquiry on the district judge both at the time that the plea is accepted and later when sentence is rendered against the defendant to inquire in the event that any fact is presented to the judge concerning the nature of the crime or the character of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.625" offset="2633853">In this case, there was no questioning whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.758" offset="2646392">Not one question of the petitioner himself as to what he understood to be the nature of the accusation nor of the petitioner's counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.968" offset="2687248">Both of these persons were present and available to testify and much of the confusion in the record could have been cleared of had the district judge address questions to them.</text>

            <text syncTime="655.418" offset="2725073">Well, may I -- I hope this won't disturb the order of your argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.303" offset="2752554">I'd like to call your attention of the last sentence of Rule 11 as amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.434" offset="2785155">I take it from reading your brief that you, although you referred of that last sentence, you don't really rely on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.871" offset="2814830">You recall of the last sentence says that, “The court shall not enter a judgment upon a plea of guilty unless it is satisfied that there is a factual basis for the plea.”</text>
            <text syncTime="692.974" offset="2875225">Now, what was the date of the entry of judgment upon the plea?</text>

            <text syncTime="1530.157" offset="6224018">My last argument is on the constitutional question involved here and I think it's pointed out well by the alternative suggested by counsel for the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.163" offset="6264038">Counsel for the respondent says that this is the first case which has come up on a direct appeal from the acceptance of the plea of guilty which was not preceded by a motion to vacant or by a motion to withdraw.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.155" offset="6315969">I note in my reply brief, that the authority say that by the respondent for this position that they accept in usual methods are motion to withdraw or a motion to vacate, leave the defendant below with unconstitutional alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.649" offset="6382007">If he moves to withdraw the plea, he must accept the burden of proving innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.709" offset="6406248">If he doest that, it seems to me that Fifth Amendment guarantee of due process and the presumption of innocence are reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.283" offset="6436551">If he should move to vacate the sentence that motion under 2255 can only be made when the defendant is in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.183" offset="6472077">So the alternatives left open to the defendant in a situation such as this are to either go into custody and move to vacate, or accept a burden of proving innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.929" offset="6519097">We feel that this constitutional question has not been answered by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.916" offset="6539055">We therefore respectfully submit that the judgment should be reversed and the cause remanded for trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1619.510" offset="6581373">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.354" offset="6592763">The Court is handicapped we feel in this case because it is Your Honor direct appeal as the petitioner points out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.321" offset="6624632">Although he -- as I understand it still makes two claims, one, that there was not sufficient objective factual basis for the entry of the judgment on his plea and two, that before accepting the plea, the trial judge did not make an adequate determination as to his subjective understanding of the nature of the charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.522" offset="6721494">Although the petitioner's case is based upon these two contentions, we in fact have no testimony by the defendant as to whether or not he did understand the charges and not even in a factual allegation that he did not understand the charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.317" offset="6796622">And also we have little if any direct evidence relating to the charges themselves upon which we can determine whether or not there was in fact an objective basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.108" offset="6843852">However, the record does indicate a number of the circumstances surrounding this plea and the entry of judgment upon it and we feel that's it's important to bear some of this in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.205" offset="6900172">First of all, the nature of the charge itself, the indictment which related to tax deficiencies in one year of 1960 is simple and straight forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.094" offset="6955760">It charged that the defendant willfully and knowingly attempted to evade his taxes for that year by willfully and knowingly filing a tax return understating his income by some $13,000.00 which was somewhat more than 40% of the total alleged income for that year.</text>

            <text syncTime="3872.724" offset="15594245">If I might make two brief points Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3877.227" offset="15612322">Counsel for the respondent has brought up one thing which we argued in our brief and which counsel for respondent has never answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3887.012" offset="15651401">He said that in accord of sorts was reached that Government counsel indicated to the judge when he appeared ex parte because of the defendant silliness that the matter would not go to trial according to counsel for the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3904.359" offset="15720782">Later on, the District Court was informed that there was an understanding that tax and penalties would be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3914.242" offset="15760384">If this is true and we have argued, if this is true, is this not another urgency or inquiry that a man who has to the knowledge of the District Court been hospitalized for alcoholism who could not stand trial two weeks before he entered his plea of guilty because of illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3935.164" offset="15844080">Is it not significant that the Government now argues that there might have been some accord?</text>
            <text syncTime="3941.439" offset="15869158">I think that this is another point indicating that there was a need for the District Court to inquire in this matter and that this should not have been left unnoticed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3954.462" offset="15921194">Lastly, I would like to point out that the finding which the court has made in this case at page 8 of the appendix is not that there is any determination on the defendant's understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3968.082" offset="15975737">The finding that the court makes is that the defendant was advised of the consequences are clearly in the record is no finding at all that there was any informing of the defendant as to the nature of the charge, there's nothing in the record to indicate whether or not the defendant actually did understand the charge and the statements in the record which give some evidence on this matter are inconsistent with an understanding plea of guilty to a charge of a crime which requires specific intent for its fruition.</text>

            <text syncTime="4032.933" offset="16235081">Well, I think if the allocution that the matters, that the very first matter that came to the judge in the allocution was the defendant's statement if it were not for my health and the things that I have gone through it never would have happened and it was not deliberate and I am sorry, that is almost verbatim what he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="4053.842" offset="16318777">I think when you have a specific intent crime, a statement such as, it is not deliberate, a vague, and amorphous statement of that nature requires inquiry.</text>

            <text syncTime="4069.943" offset="16383143">If it is what counsel for the respondent called an active contrition, it certainly is not an admission of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="4078.954" offset="16419192">At no point in this record is there an admission of guilt, an admission of understanding, and an admission that the mental state necessary to the crime was ever present.</text>
            <text syncTime="4091.710" offset="16470183">Now, counsel wants us to go back to the district court and to go through one of the procedures which you suggests, one of which would require that the defendant be in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="4103.453" offset="16517204">The other procedure would require that the defendant bear the burden of proving his innocence.</text>
