            <label>Mr. Randall C. Coleman</label>
            <text syncTime="32.691" offset="234141">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.484" offset="249292">The issues before the Court today are whether pier injuries to longshoreman are injuries which occurred on navigable waters of the United States and are thus within the coverage of the Longshoreman's Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.554" offset="313553">That question was answered in the affirmative by the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, and therefore as one of the reasons that the Fourth Circuit decided the case affirmatively was that the Admiralty Extension Act broadened and expanded the coverage of the Longshoreman's Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.464" offset="397249">The Court will also have before it the Admiralty Extension Act and whether or not it did in fact extend the coverage to the Longshoreman's Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.753" offset="442389">The facts in the case are undisputed and I will give them, Your Honors together with the history of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.142" offset="475930">These consolidated cases arose from pier injuries to three longshoremen.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.457" offset="509158">One of the injuries resulted in the death of the longshoreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.737" offset="530369">The cases arose, two of them, William Johnson and Joseph Klosek arose in Maryland and one Albert Avery arose in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.603" offset="577808">They were pier injuries under virtually identical circumstances because all three of the longshoremen involved were, what is known as slingers.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.990" offset="619290">They worked and were working at the time of the injuries in gondola cars on piers.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.507" offset="645413">They were slinging on cargo which was attached to ships' falls or cables which then loaded the cargo which was being slung on to the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.359" offset="704763">The piers in the -- well the pier in the Maryland case was on the Patapsco River.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.846" offset="742797">It extended out into that river approximately 600 feet, I believe, and there's no question that the Patapsco River is navigable waters of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.587" offset="789713">The pier in the Virginia case, city piers of north of Virginia extended I think about a thousand feet into the Elizabeth River.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.285" offset="836524">There's also no dispute that the Elizabeth River is on navigable waters of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.479" offset="869334">It was found as a fact and not disputed that these longshoremen in both cases might have been working on the pier at one time.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.234" offset="904338">They might also have gone aboard the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.700" offset="918131">They sometimes switched positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.841" offset="930774">It is also found as a fact and undisputed that these particular piers were piers which were erected on pilings.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.046" offset="971525">And certain small craft could get under them, and I think canoes and rowboats were named. Large vessels could not because the piers instructed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.831" offset="1034742">The Deputy Commissioner Oosting in Virginia and Deputy Commissioner Traynor in Maryland both found that the injuries to these men which resulted when cargo swung against the men, in the case of Joseph Klosek, he was knocked out off the gondola car to the dock and sustained fatal injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.118" offset="1131813">The other two men Johnson and Avery were pinned against the side of the railroad car.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.093" offset="1159711">The Deputy Commissioner found that those injuries, both Deputy Commissioners, found that those injuries were injuries which did not occur upon navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.787" offset="1202552">The opinions of both the Deputy Commissioners were then appealed to the district courts first to the Eastern District of Virginia and to the District Court for the District of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.571" offset="1253648">And the district judges, Judge Hoffman from the Eastern District of Virginia, Judge Watkins from the District of Maryland affirmed the findings of the Deputy Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.360" offset="1296802">The cases were then appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.859" offset="1322820">They were first, the Avery case and the Johnson and Klosek cases were first argued in separate panels, and after that they were consolidated and the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit en banc heard all three cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.201" offset="1396172">They reversed the two district judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.962" offset="1415189">Certiorari was applied for by the Nacirema Operating Company in the Maryland case by Liberty Mutual Insurance Company in the Virginia case, and by Solicitor General on behalf of the two Deputy Commissioners and with us before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.731" offset="1502333">The principal point upon which I rely is that for some years, the piers have been considered extensions of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.227" offset="1564296">I believe that was the law some time ago and is presently the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.599" offset="1589791">The point was never mentioned by the Court of Appeals below and I think the Court of Appeals might have had somewhat difficult time answering the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.791" offset="1646529">A number of cases from this Court were cited, they were on page 10 of our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.448" offset="1673174">The most recent that I can think of, of this Court is the opinion announced by Mr. Justice Black in Swanson against Marra Brothers which I think is certainly still the law, it certainly the most well known case.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.365" offset="1744854">I will only quote that portion of the opinion which relates to this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.208" offset="1768155">“Swanson was a longshoreman who was injured on the pier when a life raft fell from the ship and injured him.”</text>
            <text syncTime="424.907" offset="1802951">And this Court said without dissent, but since the Act, that's the Longshoreman's Act, is restricted to compensation for injuries occurring on navigable waters, it excludes from its own terms and from the Jones Act, any remedies against the employer for injuries inflicted on shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.042" offset="1887587">The Act leaves the injured employees in such cases to pursue the remedies afforded by local law.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.320" offset="1920606">The Court then and prior to that had always considered pier injuries to be shore injuries, and I submit Your Honors that that is still the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.146" offset="1967940">The Court, this Court has always followed I believe, the line of demarcation which was set out in the Jensen case years ago, and that line is the line between state and federal coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.427" offset="2037112">And specifically it's the line between navigable waters and land, or extensions of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.877" offset="2070862">I think that has always been the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.749" offset="2086327">So far as I know, there has never been a decision, except that of the Fourth Circuit which disputes that pier injuries are considered as land injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.308" offset="2144632">The injuries in this instance, all having occurred on the pier don't fall within the stated exception of the Act, which is any dry dock.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.519" offset="2193429">Dry docks were explained and detailed as to what they were by Mr. Justice Douglas in Avondale Marine Ways against Henderson I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.555" offset="2245569">And it was clearly pointed out that the types of dry dock referred to are not wharfs or piers, as they were in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.953" offset="2287156">The case does not -- the injuries do not fall within the Court's exception which was in Mr. Justice Black's decision in Davis against the Department of Labor in the twilight zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.329" offset="2340655">The twilight zone as I understand it is that sort of hazy area between the ship and the pier where it's difficult to determine which coverage does apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.777" offset="2386526">And the Court in the twilight zone cases has held that there may be both state and federal coverage and the injured longshoreman may elect.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.460" offset="2445249">The case most heavily relied upon by the court below was Calbeck against Travelers Insurance Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.471" offset="2481298">I hope since it was discussed at some length that this Court won't consider it presumptions of me, in particularly Mr. Justice Brennan to try to state what I think that case held.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.338" offset="2532707">I do not think that the case held as the Court of Appeals below said it held that pier injuries could be covered by the Longshoreman's Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.568" offset="2577638">That was a case Your Honors will recall which involved two or more shipyard workers who were injured aboard ships which were on navigable waters under new construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.421" offset="2637093">They were ships under construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.364" offset="2648795">Now the Court had before it, its prior holding in 1922 of Grant Smith-Porter Ship Company against Rohde, and that case long ago had established that there was a local concern in navigable -- in ships that were under construction in navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.902" offset="2750986">And where there were such local concern that the State Compensation Acts could apply that there and in that instance the state acts may apply and federal coverage did not come into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.227" offset="2816293">Now, I gathered from Mr. Justice Brennan's opinion that this Court was very much concerned with whether or not in all the cases where there was local concern, and particularly in the very case it was before it there would definitely be coverage for longshoremen who were injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.099" offset="2911796">There was the fear, I got from the opinion there was the fear that there might not be state or federal coverage somewhere for those men who were working in areas that the pre-1927 decisions had set aside as local concern areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.613" offset="3001866">So the court in reversing the Fifth Circuit, I believe it was the Fifth Circuit, in reversing the Fifth Circuit held that what this Act meant was precisely what it said.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.606" offset="3061844">It wanted to cover injuries which occurred to longshoreman on navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.269" offset="3088488">It didn't mean all injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.471" offset="3097266">It meant injuries on navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.354" offset="3108760">There was no dispute that there is no dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.686" offset="3122134">There can be no dispute that ships under construction just as much as ships that have been built are on navigable waters if they are afloat or in a dry dock or a marine railway.</text>

            <text syncTime="1401.115" offset="5707839">And that act -- and where that maritime jurisdiction extends under the very lengthy discussions in those three cases Jensen, Knickerbocker and Dawson was again navigable waters because the lands were within the exclusive jurisdiction of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.902" offset="5782967">Now, I'm not at all sure that that would be followed now.</text>

            <text syncTime="1433.863" offset="5838869">But what was the power of Congress, I suppose in passing the Admiralty Extension Act was the maritime jurisdiction?</text>

            <label>Mr. Randall C. Coleman</label>
            <text syncTime="1441.422" offset="5869066">Well, they merely expanded the admiralty tort jurisdiction, and I'm not sure whether that was commerce or whether it might have been Maritime, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.655" offset="5922043">I think it might've been commerce but I'm not sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.745" offset="5954330">But I know that the approach given by the court below which is a status approach certainly contradicts any idea that the Admiralty Extension Act extends -- extends the coverage of the Longshoreman's Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.034" offset="6047535">I finally point out that the Court in the Calbeck case also quoted extensively Senate Report 973, which was the crux of the legislative history in a footnote and in part it said “injuries occurring in loading or unloading are not covered, unless they occur on the ship or between the wharf and the ship.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.126" offset="6151920">That's what Congress intended and as I understand this Court's decision in Calbeck and many others, it felt the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.868" offset="6182849">And certainly did as recently as Calbeck.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.441" offset="6201135">Now, to the Admiralty Extension Act, I believe the reading of the Act itself makes it fairly clear that the court below in finding that the Admiralty Extension Act did extend the coverage of the Longshoreman's Act was mistaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.861" offset="6298833">The second part of the Admiralty Extension Act to which very little attention seems to have been paid, and which was not commented upon is that in any such case, suit may be brought in rem or in personam according to the principles of law and the rules of practice obtaining in cases where the injury or damage has been done and consummated on navigable water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.652" offset="6405935">Now one thing that is definite about the Longshoreman's Act, suit is not brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.831" offset="6434670">The Longshoreman's Act is -- involves an administrative proceeding where in a claim is filed with an administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.174" offset="6472077">It can't be done in rem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.957" offset="6479182">It can't be done for damages -- for damage, it is done for injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.902" offset="6503006">And it is strictly and purely an administrative proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.806" offset="6518575">And to argue as is argued below and by respondents that the Admiralty Extension Act expands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.569" offset="6557654">It is completely contradictory to the same argument that the Longshoreman's Act is status-oriented, because if there's one thing the Admiralty Extension Act is, it is clearly situs-oriented.</text>

            <text syncTime="1695.541" offset="6885543">So I think the Admiralty Extension Act applies only to a right which they have exercised and does not expand the rights they have which are considerable under the Longshoreman's Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1734.689" offset="7042173">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.642" offset="7061922">The question in this case is solely one of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.863" offset="7082820">Though there is of course a constitutional background.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.818" offset="7102673">In some ways as Mr. Justice Fortas has indicated, it's in a sort of never-never land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.181" offset="7132139">But I think that it helps if we focus on the fact that we are dealing with the construction and application of a statute which was passed by Congress in 1927 more than 40 years ago, and has never been amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.364" offset="7212805">It's appealing to think that the time has come when the statute here involved should be given a broader sweep as the court below has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.861" offset="7254810">But it's an appeal I submit that should be resisted in the interest of proper allocation of governmental powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.150" offset="7299950">We've become accustomed to growing and expanding constructions of the Constitution, and there's reason for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.541" offset="7333491">Since constitutions are often written in general terms and they are hard to change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.021" offset="7359404">In the area of statutory construction though, Congress always has the power to amend the statute if it thinks that is desirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.830" offset="7398693">And in the allocation of powers between the great branches of the Government, it's the function of Congress to amend statutes and not of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.861" offset="7438817">As this Court itself pointed out in the Pillsbury case involving the Longshoreman's Act some years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.852" offset="7482807">We don't contend that the proper construction of the statutory provision is a matter of black and white, as legal questions rarely are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.048" offset="7527528">But there are elements which we believe point clearly enough to a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.981" offset="7555323">The relevant language is in Section 903 of Title 33 and is set out just about the middle of page 3 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.207" offset="7612165">Beginning with fourth line of that provision, I would call attention to three elements in the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.420" offset="7657096">There is first, occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.171" offset="7696071">Now, upon is a common word and common words often have many shades of meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.180" offset="7728044">This word in this place must take its content in part at least from its background, the most important element of which was the Jensen case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.758" offset="7778408">The dictionary definition of upon is short and sweet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.824" offset="7802650">I looked it up this morning in the second edition of the Webster's International “upward so as to be on.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.021" offset="7843506">And that makes it turn to on and on as defined as the position of contact with or against a supporting surface.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.042" offset="7895542">I don't think the dictionary definition helps a great deal, but it does make it apparent that here the men were upon the pier and not upon the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.732" offset="7942248">But in addition to the Jensen case, there was also the Nordenholt case and not to mention the Cleveland Terminal and Valley Railroad case, both of which were well known when the statute was written.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.853" offset="7998777">In both of those cases, pier injuries were held to be outside the admiralty jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.580" offset="8033677">It said that these piers were above the water, and that indeed small boats and canoes can travel beneath the piers on the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.782" offset="8066487">But that's not where the injury occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.687" offset="8074115">It occurred on a pier which is a structure fixed in land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.402" offset="8104939">Now when these workmen were on the pier, they were above the water surely, but they were not upon the water they were upon the pier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.442" offset="8149138">Suppose they've been on a bridge over the water but resting on the two banks of the navigable stream?</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.615" offset="8181844">They would then have been above the water, and thus upon the water in the same sense that they were here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.767" offset="8214444">But no one would say that a person on a bridge was upon that water even though ships could pass underneath.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.743" offset="8254360">Next, we come to the phrase immediately following (including any dry dock).</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.279" offset="8288528">Note that this is including any dry dock, not any dock or any dock or pier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.482" offset="8321337">The fact that Congress expressly included any dry dock is some indication that it did not include other docks or piers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.702" offset="8354147">I don't suggest that the other construction is impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.830" offset="8370657">I do submit that it is unlikely and that the construction which would make the applicable -- the Act applicable to injuries occurring on any dock or pier is not only unnatural in the light of the situation which Congress understood when it wrote the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.618" offset="8437844">But also makes this phrase of little use in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.452" offset="8457174">Such a construction should I think be avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.518" offset="8473475">And finally, in these same few lines of the statute, we come to the last clause and if recovery for the disability or death through workman's compensation proceedings may not validly be provided by state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.521" offset="8545468">Now it's said that this last clause was written out of the statute by this Court's decision in the Calbeck case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.724" offset="8582248">I'm planning to devote the final portion of my available time to a discussion of the Calbeck case, but I will say now that I don't think the statement I have just recounted is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.436" offset="8641076">Writing provisions out of the statute is not the function of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.230" offset="8660302">And I don't interpret the Calbeck decision as attempting to do so. On the contrary, the present case is I submit an excellent example of a situation where this final clause is applicable and is dispositive of the question of construction and of the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.821" offset="8746611">Turning specifically to the question of construction, I've already referred to the language of the statute but the argument is confirmed by the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.228" offset="8804289">The statute including this jurisdictional language was of course passed following the Jensen decision and the two cases where the Court struck down the first two attempts of Congress to deal with the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.405" offset="8864998">Not only was the Jensen case there was clear territorial implications, but this Court had already decided the Nordenholt case in 259 U.S. in an opinion by Mr. Justice McReynolds who was the author of the Jensen opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.292" offset="8936573">And the Court held that an injury to a longshoreman on a pier was covered by the State Workers' Compensation Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.420" offset="8973040">This is no -- this was no mere straining to find some way to provide compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.336" offset="9000730">The Court in its opinion referred to the doctrine that locality and I'm quoting “locality is the exclusive test of admiralty jurisdiction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.957" offset="9051199">It said, Eisends who was the injured workman, was injured upon the dock, an extension of the land, “See Cleveland Terminal and Valley Railroad Company against Cleveland Steamship Company.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.916" offset="9111071">This was the setting in which Congress legislated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.057" offset="9127581">Its understanding was made explicit in the report of the Senate Committee which is set forth on page 13 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.512" offset="9169377">Now the Senate Report said that injuries occurring in loading or unloading are not covered unless they occur on the ship or between the wharf and the ship so as to bring them within the maritime jurisdiction of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.092" offset="9251715">In the process of enacting the statute, we have further evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.421" offset="9273031">For there was at one time in the Bills as they went through Congress a general provision that it should apply to any employment performed on a place within the admiralty jurisdiction of the United States, except employment of local concern, and of no direct relation to navigation or commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.256" offset="9364355">All of which would have been very uncertain in scope and would have yielded would've meant itself to a construction in this case in accordance with that of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.419" offset="9421093">But Congress took that out and substituted in its place the language which has persisted unchanged for more than 40 years upon the navigable waters of the United States including any dry dock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.496" offset="9489324">This showed a clearly territorial approach which is surely understandable in the light of the decisions as they stood at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.268" offset="9540420">Next, I would point out that this was the immediate and long continued consistent administrative construction of the statute which should be given great weight at this late day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.393" offset="9596949">Almost at once, and in a long series of rulings, the administrative agency charged with the application of the statute construed it not to apply to pier side injuries as it has done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.621" offset="9665808">And finally, since the statute was enacted, this Court's decisions lead to the same conclusion as long ago as 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.508" offset="9721396">This Court said in Parker against Motor Boat Sales and I quote, “The field in which a state may not validly provide for compensation must be taken for the purposes of the Act as the same field which the Jensen line of decision excluded from state compensation laws.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.431" offset="9821080">Without affirming or rejecting the constitutional implications of those cases, we accept them as the measure by which Congress intended to mark the scope of the Act they brought into existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.844" offset="9894745">And shortly thereafter in Davis against the Department of Labor, the Court said that “Congress as by the Longshoreman's Act accepted the Jensen line of demarcation between state and federal jurisdiction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.636" offset="9973948">And more specifically in Swanson against Marra Bros. Company, to which Mr. Coleman has referred, the Court held almost directly that a pier side injury was covered by the Longshoreman's Act citing and relying on the Nordenholt case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.765" offset="10082408">I turn now to the Calbeck case, which is of course an important authority in the construction of the Longshoreman's Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.888" offset="10126921">My submission is that it supports our construction of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.445" offset="10149177">Some language in it is taken out of context to sustain the contrary argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.948" offset="10175195">But that argument will not survive, I submit, when the language is placed in the context of the decision as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.390" offset="10212916">In the first place, we must give consideration to the actual facts of the Calbeck case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.932" offset="10239143">The language of an opinion of course takes significance as applied to the facts which were before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.641" offset="10265893">And in the Calbeck case, the Court was dealing with an injury to an employee who was working on a ship which was afloat on navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.537" offset="10313540">This is the clearest possible situation within the admiralty jurisdiction and within the Jensen case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.612" offset="10345827">The workmen there were on the water side of the Jensen line of demarcation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.691" offset="10370173">And what the Court said has great relevance to injuries which are so clearly maritime that this was the area on which the Court focused is clearly shown by the repeated references in the opinion to “injuries incurred on navigable waters.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.441" offset="10449168">This phrase occurs at least nine times in the opinion with slight variations. As to such injuries, the Court did use some rather broad language, but it was only such injuries that were actually before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.112" offset="10515832">That the Court did not intend to go further is shown by its reference to the ex-adoption of, and here again I quote “the Jensen line between admiralty and state jurisdiction as the limit of federal coverage.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.520" offset="10581452">And its reference to the fact that in Davis against the Department of Labor, the Court had pointed out that, and again I quote “the Act adopts the Jensen line of demarcation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.592" offset="10649788">It should be observed too that the in the Calbeck case, the Court at page 129 cited the Nordenholt case with approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.303" offset="10692629">Where it had been held just before the enactment of the statute, that injuries on piers were on the state authority side of the Jensen line of demarcation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.938" offset="10751143">Thus, Calbeck when closely examined deals only with the water side of the Jensen Act of demarcation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.141" offset="10791894">It accepts --</text>

            <label>Mr. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="2701.378" offset="10908923">Certainly a barge floating beside a ship which is being used in unloading a ship would be within the admiralty jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.568" offset="10945599">And I don't recall a case which has involved a floating pier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.524" offset="10973497">But I think that it's very likely that that would be held to be within the admiralty jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.961" offset="10999202">Certainly, it was not the situation which was involved in the Nordenholt case which was a fixed structure built on land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.510" offset="11041416">Calbeck as I have said does accept the Nordenholt case and makes it plain that a pier side injury such as that involved here is and always has been understood to be covered by the state acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.693" offset="11114141">And is thus outside the scope of the Longshoreman's Act not only because the injury is on the state side of the Jensen line of demarcation, but also because coverage of the Longshoreman's Act is expressly excluded by the final clause of Section 3 (a) since a remedy under the State Act is clearly available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.034" offset="11203480">And this is the case it seems to me where that final clause can properly be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.043" offset="11243499">In the Calbeck case, the Court did quote some rather expansive language from Judge Hutcheson in the De Bardeleben Coal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.510" offset="11285400">But nevertheless, the case itself involves injuries which were clearly on the water side of the Jensen line of demarcation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.774" offset="11346422">Congress did undertake to use its authority to the full as it then understood its authority to be under this Court's decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.164" offset="11391979">In undertaking to meet its responsibility, it drew the line which it understood to be the Jensen line of demarcation to which this Court has frequently since made reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.411" offset="11445060">Though it may be that it could draw the line some place else if it were enacting the statute now, and I think it could. This is the place where it did draw the line when it enacted this statute in 1927.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.200" offset="11504201">Nothing that has happened since is an appropriate reason for a court to draw the line someplace else that is the responsibility and the prerogative of Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="2864.770" offset="11562402">I should like to define the issues involved in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.883" offset="11586853">At the conclusion of my introductory portion, I'll be very happy to proceed in which ever direction you suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.474" offset="11617259">One, discuss the points set forth in my brief but in a different sequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.298" offset="11648606">Two, limit my discussion basically to the philosophy of five cases of this Court commencing with O'Donnell versus Great Lakes and terminating with the Reed decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.347" offset="11720808">Or three, devoting the time I have allotted to responding to any questions you may care to direct to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.918" offset="11779009">First of all, these cases involve longshoreman who are members of a gang, a work unit, actively engaged in discharging cargo from a vessel alongside of a pier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.572" offset="11853615">Their duties, their rest periods, their lunch periods require them to go back and forth between the vessel and the pier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.899" offset="11902934">They're doing the same work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.494" offset="11913383">They're receiving the same pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.807" offset="11926549">They are exposed to the same risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.707" offset="11942222">We're not dealing in this case with anyone running to an office downtown, anyone working in a machine shop, anyone driving a laundry truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.168" offset="11988093">My second point is the issue in these cases is not of constitutional magnitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.053" offset="12027591">Jensen, Stewart, Dawson these cases held that admiralty was exclusively federal and that states could not be permitted to invade that domain with or without attempted congressional sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.121" offset="12115884">The crucial question in these cases is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.617" offset="12133857">May the federal government legislate in a field where the states may also have exercised some dominion?</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.409" offset="12180982">These other cases we're looking in the opposite direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.181" offset="12200103">They were -- the issue there was one of permissiveness by this Court and not a limitation on the power or the authority of the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.063" offset="12251617">The third point, there are two basic sources of jurisdiction for Congress, one the admiralty article, two the commerce article.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.405" offset="12320998">I'm afraid I must differ with the distinguished Solicitor General when he appeared before you a few moments ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.719" offset="12354226">He indicated that the exclusive source of admiralty jurisdiction was locality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.093" offset="12383796">Locality determines jurisdiction with reference to torts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.028" offset="12403440">But admiralty also has the contract aspect and there, it's the nature of the contract and not the locality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.479" offset="12449311">In addition to this, we have the commerce power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.933" offset="12471150">These two powers are totally separate distinct independent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.786" offset="12494555">They may be exercised jointly or independently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.663" offset="12518066">In the Longshoreman Act, Congress was aware of and actually did exercise both of these powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.167" offset="12564041">The next point I find myself in agreement with the Solicitor General, we feel that these cases revolve about the correct liberal interpretation of the simple term “upon the navigable waters of the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.887" offset="12634885">The Court of Appeals held that this term applied equally to all structures on navigable waters whether the structure happened to be a pier or a ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.100" offset="12687757">And also to all injuries, whether the longshoreman happened to be aboard the ship on the deck, or on the deck of a pier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.488" offset="12737285">The final comment in this introductory portion I should like to make is this Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.035" offset="12771558">Under the Maryland law, the widow and the family would receive a maximum of $15,000.00, under the federal statute the benefits will be in the neighborhood of $63,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.237" offset="12832371">We submit that a hidden issue in this case the cause to the insurance company and ultimately to the stevedoring contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.997" offset="12867375">And as this Court has repeatedly held that is not a valid issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.580" offset="12885661">The human cost of doing business should be born by the industry and not by the victim of the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.521" offset="12945429">The -- before I leave that, I think Mr. Justice Fortas directed a question to the Solicitor General and inquired “suppose we have a floating dry dock belay that a floating pier, what would be the ruling in such a situation?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.994" offset="13039365">Well it so happens that there has been such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.754" offset="13054412">And this is illustrative of the conflict and the confusion which is existing throughout the country today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.063" offset="13091610">A recovery for the longshoreman was awarded by the compensation commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.619" offset="13125883">As I recalled it, this recovery was affirmed by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.834" offset="13146676">It then went up to the appellate level in the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.170" offset="13164022">The same circuit that has provided several of the authorities relied upon by the petitioners in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.858" offset="13194846">The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in a decision in 1967, I'm not sure whether it's Travelers versus Shea in 382 F.2d. or Nicholson versus Calbeck in 385 F.2d.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.039" offset="13247509">But the Court of Appeals reversed and held that the injury was not compensable under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.835" offset="13294738">Now, my first point, if you wish me to follow the brief basically.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.160" offset="13332041">Alright, but suppose I take the first point that I may deviate to another system Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.407" offset="13357014">My first point is, in addition to mean factually upon navigable waters, piers or their indispensable edge-ons, the facts of these cases are conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.278" offset="13408528">We might say that there's a veritable tidal wave of navigable waters in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.119" offset="13439875">First, we have the Solicitor General's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.123" offset="13467878">He says the relevant facts are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.857" offset="13482820">Then we have the admissions on the pleadings and the Klosek and Johnson cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.274" offset="13504449">I'm on page 29 of my brief at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.164" offset="13532035">And of course in these undisputed verities is the fact the piers involved on our controversy are “upon navigable waters.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.512" offset="13573413">Now going back to Johnson and Klosek, in our complaint for review which was filed on the admiralty side in the District of Maryland, we asserted “the complainant was working as a longshoreman on the 600 foot Bethlehem Steel High Pier located upon navigable waters” that's our allegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.405" offset="13657004">Paragraph two of the answer of the petitioner in Nacirema in this particular case reads as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.867" offset="13690859">“This respondent admits the matters and facts alleged in the second article of the complaint.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.183" offset="13720116">Turning our attention briefly to the Avery case, there is an expressed stipulation to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.755" offset="13746343">That appears at page 9 of the appendix that the pier is upon navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.448" offset="13777168">Over and above that, in the finding of fact by Deputy Commissioner Traynor, he held as a fact “the surface of the pier is situated over the navigable waters.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.176" offset="13848116">And of course we have the admissions made by Mr. Coleman when he first appeared before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.287" offset="13880508">He stated “there's no question that the Patapsco River is navigable waters of the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.948" offset="13903182">Point three of his concession was that the pier was located on pilings and its small boats could navigate under them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.904" offset="13946964">It is our position that this often by itself is dispositive of the issue involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.612" offset="13985834">Now, suppose I pass on to an analysis of the principle and philosophy in the -- what I consider the five leading cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.333" offset="14040691">My brief, I believe, contains references to 60 some odd cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.493" offset="14061380">I think these are the most important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.023" offset="14075486">The first one is O'Donnell versus Great Lakes Dredge and Dry -- Dock Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.495" offset="14105370">This particular decision involved a suit by a seaman incidentally where back in -- that's right 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.788" offset="14142568">This case involved a suit by a seaman who was working on a type of vessel that transported sand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.439" offset="14177155">This sand was taken ashore by some sort of a pipeline system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.083" offset="14199724">He was ashore repairing a gasket on this discharging device.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.039" offset="14235564">He filed a suit under the Jones Act and his claim was denied by the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.090" offset="14267747">This Court entertained certiorari, issued the writ and the case came up for disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.644" offset="14301915">Now, we feel that it's extremely interesting to note that O'Donnell in 1943 interpreted the scope of the Jones Act and fundamentally the same words as this Court did some 20 years later when it delineated the borders of the Longshoreman's Act in Calbeck.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.202" offset="14396165">In O'Donnell Mr. Chief Justice Stone in resisting an attempt to restrict the coverage of this beneficial Seaman's Act stated, I quote this is on page 39 of the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.058" offset="14451649">“Congress in the absence of any indication of a different purpose, must be taken to have intended to make them” -- them is the words of the Jones Act -- “make them so far as the words and the Constitution permit and to have given to them the full support of all the constitutional power it possesses, hence the Act allows the recovery sought unless the Constitution forbids it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.603" offset="14597831">That is the end of the quotation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.406" offset="14616952">The Jones Act as you may recall was passed in 1920.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.036" offset="14639522">It took that Act 23 years to come before this Court for the final interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.715" offset="14666271">The Longshoreman Act is taken a bit longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.709" offset="14686229">The second case I should like to discuss briefly with you is Avondale Marine Ways versus Henderson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.410" offset="14737011">This is a 1953 decision of this Court in which the Court issued a per curiam decision representing the views of eight members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.441" offset="14789151">There was no dissent, one judge did not participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.153" offset="14807960">O'Donnell I believe was also a unanimous decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.050" offset="14835545">In Avondale, the Court was dealing with a dry dock case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.060" offset="14867623">The Longshoreman Act covers two categories of workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.499" offset="14889357">It covers your longshoreman who's working on the pier and the ship and also covers your dry dock employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.181" offset="14928123">In Avondale, the situation is set forth in a footnote in the lower court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.745" offset="14958320">The factual backdrop was this, this is footnote 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.155" offset="14991966">By stipulation or by the uncontroverted testimony, it was established that at the time of the explosion on the barge, the barge had been hauled out of the Mississippi River on the cradle of a marine railway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.172" offset="15056018">We're dealing with a marine railway not technically a dry dock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.343" offset="15076707">And that both cradle and barge at the time of the explosion and for sometime previously thereto, had been at rest ashore at a point 400 feet from the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.708" offset="15150164">To the predecessor court, it was so obvious that the Longshoreman Act should be liberally construed and applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.183" offset="15188093">It did not even bother with writing an opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.130" offset="15199901">It had a one sentence per curiam affirming an award in favor of the man who was injured on this barge 400 feet inland of navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.351" offset="15252773">Not on a dry dock but on a marine railway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.961" offset="15271267">Our analogy there is that if the dry dock portion of coverage is to be applied with sufficient liberality as to embrace someone 400 feet inland, certainly a man injured on a pier just a few feet from the edge of the ship and still at that time physically upon navigable waters should also be held to be encompassed within the protection intended by Congress when this Act was passed back in 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="3831.220" offset="15428211">The third case of course is our incomparable Calbeck.</text>
            <text syncTime="3838.047" offset="15455587">That has been pretty well commented upon already.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.602" offset="15489755">I don't know whether any further elaboration is required at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3850.014" offset="15503444">I don't want to belabor it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.974" offset="15519222">The courts have not concurred in the views expressed by Mr. Coleman when he tries to place a very limited application on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3869.730" offset="15582333">Now as we all know, a case has basically two components.</text>
            <text syncTime="3877.991" offset="15615352">First it has the precise determination of the issue based on the particular facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3888.378" offset="15656835">Secondly, from that precise determination it transcends into establishing or following a principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.690" offset="15702183">Now the principle of law, we all know the facts of Calbeck.</text>
            <text syncTime="3903.539" offset="15717543">Simply that although in the past state camp was held applicable to a launched but uncompleted ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3910.718" offset="15746278">The lower court I think said it's about 57% complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="3914.988" offset="15763310">Although the past law stated that the state could award compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3921.713" offset="15790268">Calbeck held that nevertheless the compensation, the Longshoreman's Compensation Act also applied to that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3933.060" offset="15835617">And the mere fact that there may have been recognized or permitted stated jurisdiction did not oust the federal government either Congress or the courts of its or their control and jurisdiction over admiralty matters and navigable water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3953.357" offset="15916805">We feel we have the same precise situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.658" offset="15929971">In Calbeck, there's no question that the statutes of Louisiana could apply too and be availed out by that workman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3964.473" offset="15961213">Similarly here, there's no question that the statutes, the workman's compensation of Maryland could apply to Mr. Johnson and also to the widow of Mrs. Klosek.</text>
            <text syncTime="3975.684" offset="16006144">But we submit that is totally insignificant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3978.785" offset="16018474">This case is not one of constitutional scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="3983.138" offset="16035924">We're not determining how far can the states go.</text>
            <text syncTime="3986.667" offset="16050030">We're merely deciding if the state was permitted in the past to exercise some jurisdiction in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3992.983" offset="16075316">Does that mean if we have been ousted of our tradition authority, which of course is all way back of 1789?</text>

            <text syncTime="4143.486" offset="16677282">That was a decision by this Court that divided the 8 to 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="4151.319" offset="16708629">This is frequently been referred to as the “beans on the dock case” in Puerto Rico.</text>

            <text syncTime="4176.618" offset="16809880">Then it came up before this Court on writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="4193.513" offset="16877380">I'd like to read these excerpts from the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4201.090" offset="16907682">This is 209 of 373 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="4207.156" offset="16932028">“Respondent contends that it is not liable at least in admiralty because the impact of its alleged lack of care or unseaworthiness was felt on the pier rather than aboard ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="4222.425" offset="16993050">Whatever validity this proposition may have had until 1948, the passage of the extension of Admiralty Jurisdiction Act swept it away when it made vessels on navigable water “liable for ‘damages or injury' not withstanding that such damage or injury may be done or consummated on land.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4251.535" offset="17109556">On page 210 we find this excerpt and I read it principally because of the situations conjured up in the brief submitted by an amicus on behalf of petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="4267.163" offset="17172041">“Various farfetched hypotheticals are raised such as a suit in admiralty for an ordinary automobile accident involving a ship's officer on ship's business and port, or for someone slipping on beans that continue to leak from these bags in a warehouse in Denver.</text>
            <text syncTime="4291.635" offset="17269948">We think it's sufficient for the needs of this occasion to hold that the case is within the maritime jurisdiction under 46 U.S.C.

            <text syncTime="4344.053" offset="17479555">“We agree with this reading of the case law and hold that the duty to provide a seaworthy ship and gear, including cargo containers applies to longshoremen unloading the ship whether they are standing aboard ship or on the pier.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4366.106" offset="17567848">We think we have a very analogous situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4370.530" offset="17585507">We feel that the Longshoreman Act applies whether the man is on the deck of the ship or on the deck of the pier.</text>
            <text syncTime="4379.327" offset="17620720">And the basis of that is that the foundation of the Longshoreman Act is the admiralty power of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4389.852" offset="17662830">It is the same power which gave rise to the enactment of the Jones Act, which again was an employer-employee relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="4400.715" offset="17706193">The admiralty article of the Constitution also confers admiralty jurisdiction on this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4409.778" offset="17742451">This Court in exercise of that jurisdiction and in recognition of its humanitarian objective to protect maritime workers has been constantly extending the seaworthiness or the unseaworthiness doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4428.680" offset="17818102">We feel that it's almost incomprehensible to hold that this open-end unseaworthiness protection is available to a longshoreman if he's injured on the pier, and yet the protection expressly designed for him by the Longshoreman Act has denied him when he is injured on that same pier.</text>
            <text syncTime="4453.705" offset="17918203">The final case is Reed versus S.S. Yaka.</text>
            <text syncTime="4461.594" offset="17949759">That was decided the same term of the Court 1963.</text>

            <text syncTime="4470.413" offset="17985076">It represented the views of seven members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4475.600" offset="18005765">In that case, we were dealing with a situation where the injured person filed suit against the bareboat charterer who was also his employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4488.480" offset="18057279">There was a provision in the Act which exonerated the employer from a damage suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4498.053" offset="18095626">The Court of Appeals held that since a suit could not be instituted in personam, therefore a suit could not be instituted in rem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4510.989" offset="18147349">This of course was an in rem proceeding, so the lower court held that he had no cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4519.383" offset="18180890">This Court took the case and of course held otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4529.285" offset="18220492">I'm reading now from page 415 of 373 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="4534.997" offset="18243375">We have previously said that the Longshoreman's Act “must be liberally construed in conformance with its purpose and in a way which avoids harsh and incongruous results.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4551.116" offset="18307845">We think it would produce a harsh and incongruous result one out of keeping with a dominant intent of Congress to help longshoreman to distinguish between liability to longshoremen injured under precisely the same circumstances, because some draw their pay directly from a shipowner, and others from a stevedoring company doing the ships service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4577.847" offset="18414738">The analogy here I think was sort of anticipated by Mr. Justice Fortas when he said, “suppose this sling of cargo struck two men working on the pier, just knocking one down or over to the edge of the pier and flushing the other one off into the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="4595.793" offset="18486523">The one that went into the water would be covered.</text>

            <text syncTime="4717.142" offset="18971982">Jensen itself, Your Honor -- Jensen was a longshoreman who operated an electric truck who went back and forth from the pier to the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="4726.801" offset="19010539">He was killed when he was taking cargo out off the ship's hold on to the gangway.</text>

            <text syncTime="4768.966" offset="19179186">Following that, Congress tried to pass two different laws, but neither one passed judicial scrutiny by this Court because both laws tried to confer on the state authority to act in this field.</text>

            <text syncTime="4865.187" offset="19564126">And also, it's been universally held that a -- except that I shouldn't say held, because I don't think it's been expressly before this Court in dicta has appeared in different cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4879.067" offset="19619610">It has been sort of universally accepted that on board ship or on board the gangway federal on the pier state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4886.863" offset="19650853">I believe at one time with reference to pier injuries, they even held that depends on what direction what you're going.</text>
            <text syncTime="4891.920" offset="19671019">If you're going from the pier to the ship, it's land.</text>
            <text syncTime="4895.165" offset="19684080">If you're coming from the ship to the pier, you're still on a ship until you reach the pier.</text>
            <text syncTime="4900.453" offset="19705187">But I think these hairsplitting distinctions have all been done away with.</text>
            <text syncTime="4905.398" offset="19724936">And again Your Honor, I think we're dealing in this particular case or these cases with a liberal interpretation of a liberal statute, Workman's Compensation Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4916.313" offset="19768613">So these distinctions which might have to be measured by maybe Johansen blocks the real delicate calipers shouldn't take up the time of the Court, where I think we should be dealing what is fair and equitable and what did Congress intend by passing this Act to aid and assist these men that were exposed to these numerous damages and injuries because of the hazards of their occupation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4946.825" offset="19890657">The final excerpt from Reed versus Yaka is the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="4954.660" offset="19922004">“As we said in a slightly different factual context all were subjected to the same danger, all were entitled to light treatment under law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4983.552" offset="20037569">In the conclusion portion of my brief commencing on page 34, I set forth various anomalies and bizarre situations which the petitioners are requesting this Court to ratify and support.</text>
            <text syncTime="5004.342" offset="20120743">If I may touch briefly upon the legislative history of the Act, if one thing stands out pre-eminently, it's the congressional resolve to avoid the constitutional pitfall of lack of uniformity which caused Congress to stumble in its two earlier attempts to help longshoremen.</text>
            <text syncTime="5027.201" offset="20212172">The preoccupation of the chairman with uniformity and his apprehensiveness over its possible vitiating absence, seamen were left out of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5038.104" offset="20255744">The only omission to seamen, everything else there is to extend and enlarge it that's why they put in “including any dry dock”, because in normal common sense factual appraisal, a dry dock is not upon navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="5054.054" offset="20319587">So that was a term of inclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5057.687" offset="20334111">The chairman was concerned because seamen were omitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5061.365" offset="20348844">And this preoccupation is apparent throughout all the proceedings, the Senate hearings and also the hearings before the House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="5070.332" offset="20384684">Now with represent -- with reference to the uniformity of full coverage, there was just about unanimous accord.</text>
            <text syncTime="5077.310" offset="20412583">The committees in both Houses wanted to avoid the constitutional flaw in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5084.583" offset="20441736">Labor both the ILA and the shipyard unions wanted full coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="5090.300" offset="20464619">Management supported it, in fact Mr. Keating was very critical who represented the shipowners and a very noted admiralty proctor at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5100.349" offset="20504743">He was critical of the Act because he was afraid that wasn't embracive enough, it didn't include everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="5105.955" offset="20527208">And that was one of the reasons why they changed the terminology from a place upon -- place in admiralty jurisdiction and provided that it's not a question of local concern and whatnot.</text>
            <text syncTime="5120.066" offset="20583633">The government agency entrusted with the administration of the Act when it all facets of the job covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="5127.537" offset="20613517">And to argue that the Congress of the United States deliberately excluded 25% of the longshoreman workforce, statistically 25 were on the pier and 75 are aboard ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="5142.193" offset="20672136">To argue that, that they're not protected by the Act is driving to defeat the very uniformity that Congress not only strove for but actually achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5161.905" offset="20751026">My final comment will be this Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5166.423" offset="20769102">It may come as a shock to petitioners who are so patently outnumbered of some pre-1927 views, but one can not thrust the mighty 42-year oak of the Act back into its embryonic acorn.</text>
            <text syncTime="5186.887" offset="20850918">Both the seaworthiness doctrine and the Act, and we may also interpolate here the Jones Act as well, are traceable to a common origin solicitude for maritime workers who spend their lives in such a hazardous occupation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5207.721" offset="20934301">As the seaworthiness doctrine has grown, as the application of the Jones Act has been extended, these have expanded these have developed down through the years, so to it is respectfully submitted must the Longshoreman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5228.504" offset="21017370">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="5241.019" offset="21067421">-- Ralph Rabinowitz from Norfolk, Virginia and I represent longshoreman Albert Avery who has been attempting to get compensation under this Act since 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="5249.230" offset="21100335">I take it the question before the Court is, did not Congress whose dominant purpose was to help longshoremen intended the Longshoreman's Compensation Act to cover injuries caused by ship's gear to a longshoreman in the ship's gang working the ship from a pier built upon freely flowing navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="5267.809" offset="21174627">Going right to Calbeck, the Solicitor General would have us disregard what he calls broad language.</text>
            <text syncTime="5275.135" offset="21203884">The Court was construing the very coverage language that we are involved here today with 903 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5281.351" offset="21228753">And the Court said in Calbeck, “Our conclusion is that Congress invoked its constitutional power so as to provide compensation for all injuries sustained by employees on navigable waters whether or not a particular injury might also have been within the constitutional reach of a state Workman's Compensation Law.”</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="5301.314" offset="21308583">Yes, but you rather slipped over a rather key phrase that is on navigable waters.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ralph Rabinowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="5306.481" offset="21329272">Yes, Your Honor, and this injury was upon the navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="5309.961" offset="21343169">This injury was upon the navigable waters both factually and legally.</text>
            <text syncTime="5314.550" offset="21361560">Now going right to the question that was asked about Jensen, which I think the Court has asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="5323.329" offset="21396668">Jensen was a case that said “state compensation commissions you can't touch these people because this is an admiralty matter.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5336.659" offset="21449958">After that the states over reacted to Jensen.</text>
            <text syncTime="5342.482" offset="21473259">For example, the best illustration of that is a case called Anderson against Johnson Lighterage Company, 120 New York 55.</text>
            <text syncTime="5353.397" offset="21516936">That's a case where a longshoreman on the dock, he was on the dock and he slipped down on the dock.</text>
            <text syncTime="5361.063" offset="21547656">And it was in 1918 which is right after Jensen in 1917.</text>
            <text syncTime="5367.504" offset="21573360">Now, the New York people wanted to give this fellow compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5373.904" offset="21598960">It went up through the courts, through the Court of Appeals of New York, which included Cardoso, and reading Jensen the said “we can't give this fellow compensation, why?</text>
            <text syncTime="5384.771" offset="21642428">Because in Jensen the court had said the work of a stevedore is maritime in nature and his employment was a maritime contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5396.203" offset="21688195">Injuries which he received were likewise maritime and the rights and liabilities of the parties in connection therewith were matters clearly within the admiralty jurisdiction” and so even the fellow on the dock couldn't get compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5410.554" offset="21745560">Then the Nordenholt case came along and this is history which Mr. Justice Brennan went through in the Calbeck case to come out with the holding in Calbeck, which is very important to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5423.337" offset="21796760">Now you come up with Nordenholt.</text>
            <text syncTime="5425.634" offset="21805955">Now in Nordenholt, the Court said “well, this fellow fell down from a bag of stock of pile on the dock and there's no pertinent federal statute.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5441.566" offset="21869589">And they started the local concern doctrine, or they said it's a bad result, let's start a local concern doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="5449.493" offset="21901354">Let's say that fellow who fell on the dock and his mother won't be able to get compensation, he was killed because of Jensen.</text>
            <text syncTime="5459.392" offset="21940955">If we say that, he won't get compensation, let's start the local concern doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="5463.101" offset="21955793">And they said “there's no pertinent federal statute and the -- that result will not do material prejudice or will not affect materially the maritime jurisdiction of the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5477.701" offset="22014203">And so they started the local concern doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="5479.648" offset="22021935">Now let's go back to poor Johnson, poor Johnson the fellow in New York. After the Nordenholt case came out he said “I fell on the dock too.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5488.926" offset="22059029">He went back and asked for a rehearing and the New York courts said “no, no, no we don't care about Nordenholt.</text>
            <text syncTime="5496.622" offset="22089853">We still think Jensen doesn't let you get compensation because you are fulfilling a maritime contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5504.580" offset="22121723">You are a stevedore.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5506.784" offset="22130500">And citing Imbrovek, which I never can pronounce, I don't know if that's quite correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="5511.420" offset="22149099">But the Court in Jensen said citing Imbrovek that “this is a maritime matter.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5517.131" offset="22171878">This is exclusively within the cognizance of maritime matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="5523.738" offset="22198314">The Constitution Article III Section 2 gives these powers to admiralty which is a federal domain, area of federal conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="5532.038" offset="22231542">Now this is what the Court meant I believe in Calbeck.</text>
            <text syncTime="5536.369" offset="22248887">When Mr. Justice Brennan said at 37120 “there emerges from a complete legislative history a congressional desire for a statute which would provide compensation for all injuries to employees on navigable waters; in every case that is where a Jensen might have seen to preclude state compensation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5561.873" offset="22350869">I think that's important.</text>
