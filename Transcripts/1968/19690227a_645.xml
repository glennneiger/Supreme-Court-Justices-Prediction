            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 645, John Davis, petitioner versus Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.780" offset="146474">Mr. Zarr, you may continue with your argument.</text>

            <label>Mr. Melvyn Zarr</label>
            <text syncTime="15.334" offset="164760">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.775" offset="174477">I'd like to summarize the major points I made yesterday and then say a few things about the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.652" offset="201958">The major points were these; one, that the petitioner was caught up in a police dragnet.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.703" offset="226200">Two, that the two detentions of petitioner yielding the two sets of fingerprints were illegal arrest because in the first place, in neither case was there was a warrant to earn any attempt to show exigent circumstances excusing a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.766" offset="282415">And secondly, even assuming that the warrant requirement could somehow be excused in this case, there was no attempt by the state to show probable cause to arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.854" offset="318777">Next the fact that these arrests were for investigation only explains but cannot excuse the failure to comply with these constitutional safeguards, and last that fingerprints are not accepted from the operation of the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.200" offset="388159">Now, counsel opposite stressed to the Court yesterday that the December 3rd detention, the first detention was not an arrest and apparently relied upon the court’s below ruling which in role and part appears at page 59 of the record which I shall just briefly read.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.017" offset="463391">The court below said this, the officer said that he arrested appellant but the evidence which is in no way controverted shows that appellant was merely escorted to headquarters for interrogation as in fact for numerous others in the course of an investigation by police of an unsolved major crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.951" offset="539146">It is clear from the record that there was no intention to arrest within the accepted legal meaning of the word and of course there are two answers to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.727" offset="574255">One, it is clear from the record that that statement is wrong that the only testimony in the record about December 3rd arrest is that of officer Griffin and Thompson which they say they arrested the petitioner and there is nothing to controvert that.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.356" offset="636844">And the second answer of course is that this was an investigative arrest and that as we have argued is illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.247" offset="676342">I have two evidentiary points, one, I want to stress that the petitioner had done the yard work for the woman at page 17 interrogation there that the record makes that clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.766" offset="730467">And next, I want to stress that even though Mr. Justice Stewart yesterday correctly observed that she testified that there was no doubt in my mind about it that Johnny was the one.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.980" offset="783339">In other places, she was not quite so positive at page 22 just previous to that she says, “I recognized it was Johnny.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.888" offset="814895">I thought it was but I wasn’t perfectly sure right then but then I knew nobody else have been in the house but him.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.064" offset="839659">I asked him to carry a table to the kitchen where he threw the light where the media was.”</text>
            <text syncTime="188.812" offset="858572">And on page 30 of the record, on cross-examination, she says in response to the question, “But by light of the flashlight could you see his face?”</text>
            <text syncTime="199.088" offset="899741">Answer, “Yes sir, true.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.436" offset="909145">He had that fascinator put to the head piece over it and I could see through that crochet part his face and I recognized him or who’s as far that's who it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.468" offset="945194">I was pretty sure it was.”</text>
