            <text syncTime="18.892" offset="181018">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.692" offset="196169">This case is similar in some respects to the decision and the case of result and decision in Epperson versus Arkansas which the Court decided just this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.952" offset="241204">The case is here on certiorari to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.748" offset="264401">One major distinction between Epperson and this case is that this case involves the right of public school students other than public school faculty members to exercise expressions of their opinions in a non-disruptive way in the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.718" offset="324274">Case began in the United States --</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="56.269" offset="330543">Well, this is not a religious establishment case here?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Dan L. Johnston</label>
            <text syncTime="59.126" offset="341932">No, it's not Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.145" offset="346008">It's a First Amendment free speech case in the sense of expression of views rather than a worship or establishment cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.188" offset="378190">The case began as a petition for injunction and nominal damages under 42 United States Code 1983 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.935" offset="425211">That court dismissed the petition and on appeal to the Circuit -- the decision was split 4 to 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.912" offset="453110">Conduct of the students essentially was this, that Christmas time in 1965 they decided that they would wear small black armbands to express certain views which they had in regard to the war in Vietnam.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.521" offset="515490">Specifically, the views were that they mourn the dead of both sides, both civilian and military in that war and they supported the proposal that have made by United States Senator Robert Kennedy that the truce which had been proposed for that war over the Christmas period be made an open ended or an indefinite truce.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.882" offset="596992">This was the purpose that the students gave for wearing the armbands during this period.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.491" offset="615382">During the period of time of course, there were school days and they wore the armbands to school.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.549" offset="639624">Prior to the time when any of these petitioners wore the armbands to school, it came to the attention of the school authorities that perhaps there would be some students who would express views related to the war in Vietnam in this manner during school time.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.738" offset="704408">The principles of the secondary schools, the high schools and perhaps the junior high schools in the City of Des Moines, a public school system met prior to the time in any of the armbands have been worn and enacted policy which was not written but which was agreed upon among themselves that no student could wear an armband in the Des Moines public school system for this purpose that if a student came to school wearing the armband he would be asked to remove it.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.718" offset="812241">Failing that, the student's parents would be contacted and their assistance would be solicited in getting the students to remove the armbands.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.238" offset="846409">Failing that, the students would be set home would be in effect suspended from school until such time as they were willing to return to school without the armbands.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.110" offset="889877">The three students who are petitioner in this case, Christopher Eckhardt who was 16 and in the 10th grade of Roosevelt High School in Des Moines at the time, John Tinker who was 15 and in the 11th grade at another high school, Mary Beth Tinker who was 13 and in the 8th grade determined that in spite of the policy that have been announced to the schools that they would wear the armbands as a matter of conscience to express the views that they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.721" offset="1000323">Christopher Eckhardt and Mary Beth Tinker wore theirs on the first day.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.697" offset="1016205">Mr. Eckhardt went to school have the armband on but knowing of the policy against the wearing of the armbands because as I say it's been announced.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.413" offset="1051105">He went quite immediately to the office of the principal and said, “I'm wearing the armband, I know that it is a violation of the school policy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="245.612" offset="1087885">The principal carried out the dictates of the policy which were to tell the student to remove it.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.710" offset="1112231">The student said, he could not in good conscience remove the armband but he thought he had a right to wear.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.714" offset="1132293">The student's mother was called and she supported her son in the activity and then young Mr. Eckhardt was suspended from school.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.731" offset="1164372">He was out of school approximately six days or five days prior to the Christmas vacation and then one day after the Christmas vacation.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.871" offset="1196868">Mary Beth Tinker also wore her armband on that first day.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.596" offset="1211810">However, she wore it throughout the entire morning without any incident related to it and any way disrupted the school or distracted.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.525" offset="1243470">She wore it at lunch and she wore it where there was by the way some conversation between herself and other students in the lunch room about why she was wearing the armband and whether or not she should be wearing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.418" offset="1287043">And then wore it into the first class in the afternoon and it was in the first class in the afternoon that she was called to the office and the procedure was followed for contacting her parents apparently asking her to remove it and she did remove the armband and then returned to class.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.159" offset="1350050">However, in spite of the fact that she had removed the armband and returned and was returned to class, she was later called out of class and suspended nevertheless.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.972" offset="1385263">John Tinker determined that it was his belief that the armband should not be worn in open violation of the policy that the schools had adopted until some attempts have been made to try to reach an accommodation with the school board.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.373" offset="1442941">So, on the first day, John Tinker did not wear the armbands to school rather in the evening of the day when Mr. Eckhardt and John's sister Mary Beth were suspended from school, he with some other students who had worn the armbands attempted to contact the superintendent of the -- not superintendent, excuse me, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the school at the morning of public schools and they requested that he calls special meeting of the board of directors, the school board as we call it for the purpose of tying to reach an accommodation between the students, the desire of the students and the policy enacted by the principals of the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.301" offset="1594661">They were refused this special meeting of the school board and then on the next day, Friday, John Tinker wore his armband to school, wore throughout the morning hours without any untoward incident, without any substantial or material disruption to the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.226" offset="1650354">He wore at lunch where there was again some discussion about it in a period it's generally free and open for discussion among students.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.897" offset="1676999">And then wore into the first class in the afternoon where he was suspended.</text>

            <text syncTime="397.848" offset="1696852">What if the student that got enough in the class he went to and delivered the message orally that his armband was intended to convey and insisted on doing it?</text>

            <text syncTime="1636.146" offset="6649981">The respondents believe that there are two basic issues involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.446" offset="6683209">The first, the school administrators are school boards have to wait from until violence, disorder and disruption break out and scholarly discipline of the school is disrupted or may they acted when in good faith in their reasonable discretion and judgment, disorder and disruption of scholarly atmosphere of the schoolroom will result unless they act firmly and properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.014" offset="6837436">The second issue it seems to me is that this Court must determine how far it wants to go under the constitutional amendments for free speech in reviewing every decision of every school district made in good faith in its reasonable discretion and judgment as necessary to maintain order and scholarly discipline atmosphere within the classroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.633" offset="6999918">The third issue, might be added, are disturbances or threatened disturbances in the schools to be measured by identical standards with disturbances or threaten disturbances on the streets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.625" offset="7079957">Now, it's the position of the respondents that the decision of the school administration and of the school board made in good faith under the circumstances existing when that decision was made was the reasonable exercise of discretion on the part of school authorities and did not deprive petitioners of their constitutional right of free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.202" offset="7202210">Now, this Court has held that freedom of speech including of course the right of demonstration is not an absolute right to be exercised regardless of time or place.</text>

            <text syncTime="1982.395" offset="8034994">In the background of this case, in November of 1965, the petitioner, Christopher Eckhardt with his mother who was president of the Des Moines Chapter of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, had come to Washington D.C. to participate with the students for Democratic Society, Dr. Spock and others in the march, which I'm sure this Court is familiar with from the White House to the Washington Monument.</text>

            <text syncTime="2023.035" offset="8197580">On Saturday, December 11, 1965 following this march, a group which included students related to the students for a Democratic Society and some adults met at the Eckhardt home and one of the proposals that developed this meeting was the wearing of these black armbands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.036" offset="8297576">None of these petitioners were present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.717" offset="8312310">Now, as the trial court said and this is on page 73 of the appendix, the last paragraph, that Vietnam War and the involvement of the United States therein has been a subject of a major controversy for some time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.585" offset="8407709">When the armband regulation involved herein was promulgated, debate over the Vietnam War had become vehement in many localities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.446" offset="8451176">A protest march against the war had recently been held in Washington D.C.</text>

            <text syncTime="2114.521" offset="8563503">This was demonstrated during the school board's hearing on the armband regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.563" offset="8587640">And that appears also in the record, I think some 200 had gathered who were many of them are outsiders at the time of the school board hearing.</text>
