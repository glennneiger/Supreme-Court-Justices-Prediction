            <text syncTime="23.732" offset="198301">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.753" offset="210422">This case was argued to the Court previously on December 12, 1968 on the issue of whether the double jeopardy provision of the Fifth Amendment of the Federal Constitution was applicable to the State of Maryland to the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.176" offset="280116">A few days after argument, this Court ordered rehearing and rebriefing on another issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.676" offset="314075">That issue being, “Does the concurring sentence doctrine enunciated in Hirabayashi versus United States have continuing validity in light of such other decisions in more recent decisions the latest case being Sibron versus New York?”</text>
            <text syncTime="71.154" offset="387950">It is petitioner's contention that the Hirabayashi doctrine is invalid today.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.960" offset="411251">It is petitioner's further contention that the court need not reach the Hirabayashi rule in this case since both convictions where we submit invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.141" offset="455973">Briefly, the facts of the case are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.096" offset="471751">The State of Maryland with jurisdiction to do so indicted the petitioner in Prince George's County for burglary, common law housebreaking, and larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.080" offset="523682">Common law housebreaking charge was dismissed by the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.617" offset="545834">The jury acquitted the petitioner of larceny and convicted him of burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.240" offset="572374">Petitioner was sentenced to serve a term of 10 years in the Maryland Penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.261" offset="596407">He appealed his burglary conviction and the Maryland Court of Appeals remanded the conviction when the basis of its decision in Schowgurow versus the State of Maryland which case essentially held that Maryland's Constitutional provision which excluded jurors unless they professed to believe in God was violative of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.738" offset="698284">Petitioner chose to take advantage of the remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.674" offset="714062">And on the remand, he elected to be retried on the burglary charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.744" offset="734333">Because he chose to take advantage of this First Amendment rights, the petitioner was again indicted for burglary but for larceny too of which offense he was previously acquitted.</text>

            <text syncTime="189.977" offset="863274">The trial court sentenced petitioner to a term of 15 years for burglary and 5 years for larceny.</text>

            <text syncTime="274.311" offset="1200567">Of course, the Hirabayashi rule presumes that one conviction is valid and the other is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.009" offset="1231391">In this case we believe that the invalid larceny conviction infected the burglary charge and therefore the burglary was invalid also.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.584" offset="1273710">In United States versus Trenton Potteries, this Court held that it would affirm an invalid conviction in which concurrent sentences were rendered only if the jury's consideration of the valid count was not prejudiced by their consideration of the invalid count.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.889" offset="1354898">Presuming that petitioner second prosecution for larceny was constitutionally impermissible, the unfairness of charging and trying him a second time, we submit infected the entire proceeding and invalidated the burglary as well as the larceny conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.655" offset="1430026">And therefore, we ultimately asked the Court to reverse the larceny conviction and order a new trial in the burglary case.</text>

            <text syncTime="458.750" offset="1938369">In this case, the State of Maryland to conduct the prosecution successfully had to prove that Benton intended to steal when he entered the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.723" offset="1986226">In the first trial it was adjudicated that he did not intent to steal.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.252" offset="2004407">We contend that this was res judicata under the Sealfon case that this principle applies in criminal cases and that therefore he was entitled to have excluded and he mentioned in any evidence of a larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.283" offset="2056547">Thus, the state obtained an advantage that they ordinarily would not have had in proving intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.134" offset="2083924">Secondly, Your Honor, the necessity of defending two rather that one charge has technically disadvantaged the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.070" offset="2139617">Another reason why we feel that the burglary charge is invalid is that the state in this case used the device of cumulating as many charges as it could so as to promote a compromise atmosphere in the jury room and cause the jury to convict him of at least one, although of course in this case he was convicted of two.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.941" offset="2231150">We also submit that another reason why he was prejudiced and why the burglary conviction should be reversed is that the jury was permitted to consider prejudicially irrelevant testimony because again Benton had a right to have the jury not consider any evidence of larceny in view of his first acquittal and the doctrine of res judicata.</text>

            <text syncTime="638.352" offset="2656737">Whereas they might have been able under ordinary circumstance to show that an asportation had taken place, they couldn't once this matter was adjudicated in his favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.054" offset="2707623">Oh, we also submit that there are certain cases that decided by this Court that hold that even though there is no isolatable prejudice, if prejudice does permeate the trial then the entire preceding is officiated and we respectfully submit as out last ground that is another reason why the burglary conviction should be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.591" offset="2809710">Thank you Your Honor and turning now to the issue before the Court it was petitioners' contention if the Court please that the Hirabayashi concurrent sentence doctrine no longer has validity in view of Sibron versus New York which case involved the petitioner whose criminal record and background was similar to the petitioners in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.484" offset="2909288">As a result of the Sibron decision, it is incumbent upon the Government to show that no possibility of collateral legal consequences will be imposed on the basis of the challenged conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.176" offset="2972087">I believe that Sibron makes it clear that the fact that a petitioner has a substantial criminal record does not in itself mean that there are no significant collateral legal consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.480" offset="3029243">It is submitted that the rational of the Sibron case is equally persuasive in the petitioner's case and additional fact in favor of abolishment of the Hirabayashi rule in the case of concurrent sentences is the consequences that may occur where a valid conviction is set aside at a remote time for such reason as newly discovered evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.449" offset="3149197">In that case, the defendant's evidence may be stale.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.557" offset="3169573">He may be unable to locate and master his witnesses and thus unable to vindicate himself and therefore we submit that the concurrent sentence case it is even the Sibron rule is even more applicable.</text>

            <text syncTime="817.743" offset="3374373">Although, under the Sibron case it is not incumbent upon the petitioner to establish the collateral legal consequences, if it please the Court, I might venture to mention one.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.581" offset="3425677">Regrettably, due to misinformation the petitioner's brief states that he has only one felony conviction, when actually it appears that he has three felony convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.654" offset="3478026">However, the petitioner's background does have some redeeming features.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.091" offset="3499760">Following two of his felony convictions, petitioners served with distinction in the United States Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.205" offset="3532152">He was a decorated soldier, a recipient of the Purple Heart and to this day receives a veteran's administration service connected disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.985" offset="3575306">Perhaps, some future administrative body or judge will consider the petitioner's meritorious military record but will find that the invalid larceny conviction militates against favorable consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.102" offset="3647822">In this case, the petitioner does not seek a declaration in the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.008" offset="3671437">He has a substantial interest in the outcome of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.548" offset="3689514">There is nothing abstract thing or hypothetical about this -- his appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.468" offset="3721279">It is submitted that another reason exists for not applying the Hirabayashi doctrine in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.257" offset="3756387">The State of Maryland does not follow the Hirabayashi rule but instead allows the court to correct and set aside an invalid conviction at any time regardless of its immediate impact upon the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.346" offset="3832769">Following this rule, the Maryland Court of Appeals has on many occasions reversed invalid convictions when the sentences were ordered to be served concurrently with a valid conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.834" offset="3890657">We submit that application of a state remedy to a case involving a violation of a federal constitutional provision is not noble.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.148" offset="3939976">In Brady versus Maryland, this Court held that the State of Maryland violated a petitioner's right to due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment when it withheld from him exculpatory information.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.412" offset="4004968">At the same time, however, this Court held that they use to which this exculpatory information would be put was to be determines by the law of the State of Maryland rather than the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.553" offset="4069543">The Solicitor General recognizes that the Government under the doctrine of Sibron cannot possibly negate the existence of all collateral consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.993" offset="4123355">And the Solicitor General meets the problem by stating that the rule in Sibron versus New York requiring the Government to show that no possible legal collateral consequences exists should not apply in the case of concurrent sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.946" offset="4195140">However, it is respectfully submitted to the Court that the Solicitor General offers no cogent reason for distinguishing the situation where sentences have been served from the situation where sentences are to be served concurrently as in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.324" offset="4272671">The Maryland Attorney General approaches the problem differently by stating that his brief raises and negates the existence of all possible collateral consequences that might confront the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.133" offset="4339858">Since collateral consequences are often unpredictable, we submit that the state lacks such extraordinary perception in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1315.760" offset="5366366">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.900" offset="5382980">The Government is here at this Court's invitation to present its views whether the concurrent sentence doctrine has continuing validity in light of last term's cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.489" offset="5425298">In those four decisions, as the court knows, it reexamined doctrines limiting review of criminal sentences which an accused has either finished serving or has not yet began to serve and it did so recognizing that in addition to sentence itself, criminal conviction usually have legal effects such as laws of liberties which do entitle an accuse to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.353" offset="5512756">For example, the Court concluded in the Sibron case that a criminal appeal cannot be found moot simply because the principle sentence has been served.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.582" offset="5549746">The reviewing court must be convinced by the Government that there are no residual legal effects of conviction or collateral legal consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.511" offset="5581406">As we understand the question which the Court invited us to discuss, it's whether the same rule must not apply in concurrent sentence cases that is, cases in which an accused is convicted on several different counts, given sentences all of which is going to be served at the same time, and then seeks to appeal on a ground which could affect only some and not all of those convictions and sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.553" offset="5677537">In the past, courts have not reviewed all counts in such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.314" offset="5692583">Once they have determined that some of the counts are valid, they have declines to review others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.945" offset="5711182">And the notion has been that since the full sentence must be served in any event on the good counts, nothing could be gained by reviewing the others but review of the limited allegations of error would be a waste of their time and energy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.263" offset="5768443">We agree of course that any such assessment must be a realistic one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.574" offset="5785684">Review must be had as to any count which in fact does have legal effects upon the convicted person.</text>

            <text syncTime="1522.029" offset="6191522">We do not believe that the doctrine is jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.746" offset="6202389">We believe that there is any good reason and plain error may be a good reason in the Court's view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.396" offset="6224959">I may do so in the Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.789" offset="6234572">I should stress that our principal concern is not in this Court but in the Federal Courts of Appeals which have a tremendous burden of criminal appeals before them and which very frequently will receive a question as did the Second Circuit in United States versus Berger, in which we cite in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.096" offset="6303744">In that case, the defendant's were convicted on two counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.170" offset="6316074">Well, one of the substantive offense of theft from interstate commerce and the other of a conspiracy to commit that offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.308" offset="6348570">And the defendants appealed on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.365" offset="6356825">One that it was not interstate commerce, that was a definite ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.209" offset="6372185">And second, that there was insufficient evidence in the record to support the conspiracy conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.878" offset="6394859">Now, the Court of Appeals characterized that record is being an extremely lengthy one, and having found that there was interstate commerce stay on that ground declined to pass upon the conspiracy question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.577" offset="6449716">On the other hand, one frequently finds Court of Appeals in cases where error is plain or clear passing upon it and we would say that they have every right to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1671.481" offset="6789308">If they could, then we believe the concurrent sentence doctrine could not be applied because that we do concede that if there is a substantial reason for review, then review must be have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.325" offset="6836642">Oh, well there could be an alternative in that circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.980" offset="6847300">One could also say as we have indicated in a opposition which we recently filed and another case before the court, Number 1022, Proner versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.802" offset="6898604">That was a tax case in which the petitioner raised certain questions which the Court Of Appeals again determined only pertained to limited numbers of counts and specifically determined there was no crossover effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.934" offset="6951058">And the petitioner in that case alleges that there will be a collateral estoppel that there will be in civil actions to collect the taxes which are allegedly due from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.151" offset="6999960">That there will be some collateral estoppel by these judgments in the particular counts that he challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.603" offset="7021798">And what we say there is that since there was no review, there could be no collateral estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.733" offset="7042278">And I think it would be equally possible in the case you put, Mr. Chief Justice to say that since review was declined on the basis of the concurrent sentence doctrine, that conviction could not be counted towards recidivism.</text>

            <text syncTime="2213.968" offset="8959248">Sampling of those and we were able to do only a sampling of those indicate in about 20% of those cases the concurrent sentence doctrine was used.</text>

            <text syncTime="3050.553" offset="12305533">Well, is this a very efficient procedure that we have in this case where they took advantage of this multiple sentence and not only went through to all of the Maryland's courts but had been in this Court and had it reargued and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.460" offset="12397171">If the state only took advantage of those same which would not hurt that the fact and would not help them wouldn't we be relieved of all these things and why is it necessary for the state to keep a man under a conviction of two offenses where there is no difference in his sentence as you say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.844" offset="12490794">And what benefit could there be to the state to keep him under the cloud of those two convictions when one would do justice well from a standpoint of the state of rehabilitating him and if you choose punishing him whatever theory you have of sentencing the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.971" offset="12575222">Why do you want to fight as you do for all of these things when there is no good to anybody and some harm possibly to others?</text>

            <text syncTime="3126.887" offset="12610957">Well, Your Honor, I think I agree with you to this extent that the same end could be served from the state's interest by imposing a single general sentence and as you recall this is the situation in which the question is most frequently arisen in this case -- in this Court at least which arose most early but the concurrent sentence serves one function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.497" offset="12717328">It enables the trial judge to give a reviewing court some indication how he views each of the crimes charged on the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.496" offset="12761318">Now, this might very well have been an appeal where the 15-year burglary sentence was under appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.497" offset="12793396">And the five-year larceny count was not and if there were a general sentence in those circumstances assuming 15 years is possible under the Maryland larceny statute, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.063" offset="12839581">And the Court found that the burglary count was bad under general sentence to 15 years and said, “Well, since the larceny count supports it anyway we won't do anything quite plainly, there would have been substantial prejudice to the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.431" offset="12897050">So, I think the concurrent sentence does serve a valuable purpose in that respect.</text>

            <text syncTime="4035.429" offset="16245112">Mr. Chief Justice, in Sibron, I believe that you made the observation that you thought that the Pollard has in effect created a presumption of collateral consequence and that the burden was therefore on the state to prove that there was no collateral consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4057.160" offset="16332048">And I have read the Pollard, and quite frankly I see nothing in the opinion itself which directs itself to the question of presumptions under one hand or burden on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.113" offset="16379800">There is just a very short paragraph in there in which the Court says that there appears to be substantial likelihood of collateral consequences in so far as the defendant and in that case was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4083.391" offset="16436955">And it may well be that the record of the case would disclose that in fact there were some significant collateral consequences on the face that would be -- that the defendant himself might have suffer if the conviction were allowed to stand and reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4100.671" offset="16506023">And I'm merely suggest that because I'm not ready to accept that Sibron itself or that the decisions of this Court have clearly enunciated the rule that in the mootness cases, the presumption exists that there is collateral consequence on the one hand and that the burglary is on the state on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="4120.029" offset="16583450">But I do share the view of the Solicitor General that even though that may be the rule with respect to the mootness doctrine it should not be and is not we believe the rule with respect to concurrent sentencing and the Hirabayashi rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4137.298" offset="16652518">We believe that if you go to Sibron itself one thing is very clear as it is in Pollard and that is that in both instances the Court has pointed out that is not just simply a case of a possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="4154.035" offset="16719496">Is not just simply a case of the parade of horribles being dragged along and saying that anything can happen because anybody who has imagination can create a possibility simply because they have an imagination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4166.939" offset="16771114">But what the Court -- what you said Mr. Chief Justice in the Sibron case was that, if I have the right quotations, the conclusion you said, “St. Pierre versus United States, must be read in light of later cases to mean that a criminal case is moot only if it is shown that there is no possibility that any collateral legal consequences will be imposed on the basis of the challenge conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4199.467" offset="16901204">That certainly is not the case here Sibron has a substantial state in the judgment of conviction which survives the satisfaction of the sentence imposed on him and I would point out, that in the Sibron case the state acknowledged and admitted that there would be collateral consequences in so far as this particular defendant was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4224.168" offset="17000051">So, I do not argue with Sibron.</text>
            <text syncTime="4227.419" offset="17013008">I do not argue with the doctrine that whether there are substantial collateral consequences the right of review should in fact exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="4235.004" offset="17043414">The same thing is true in Pollard, if we go to the language of the Court in Pollard the Court said, “The possibility of consequences collateral to the imposition of sentence is sufficiently substantial to justify our dealing with the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4258.933" offset="17139127">Again, it is not just simply a claim of collateral of consequence but there has to be some showing and I believe that that showing should be the burden of the showing should be on the --</text>

            <text syncTime="4625.866" offset="18606791">The purpose of most habitual criminal statutes is to protect society from criminals who persist in the commission of felonies.</text>

            <text syncTime="4741.310" offset="19068635">Now, this means that we're having a backlog of cases at the appellate level, we're having a backlog of cases at the Federal District Court level and then the net end result of it is that those who are not out on bail by necessity, you're going to have to spend more time in jail awaiting either the culmination of their cases on appeal or new trials whatever the case might be.</text>

            <text syncTime="5529.340" offset="22220779">Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Justices, during the course of this argument the attorney for the petitioner raised the question as to whether any evidence of the taking of goods in this particular case should have been admitted in to evidence because of his claim that the larceny conviction was illegal, void because of double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5556.078" offset="22327672">I think it should be noted that under the law of Maryland indictment dealing with burglary was the entering, breaking and entering with the intent to steal, and evidence was introduced to show that goods had in fact been taken in order to show that the intent to steal was present on which you would base the conviction for burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5582.838" offset="22434774">As a matter of fact, it's very interesting in this particular case because the place that the defendant entered was a Wednesday Club that actually had to be the property of the people whose goods were taken but it was called the Wednesday Club, I believe it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="5604.653" offset="22522023">And people came and went and when he was first accosted in the place he claim that he was there as a guest of the Wednesday Club so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="5614.319" offset="22560684">So that it was important that they prove not only the breaking and the entering and the taking of goods for the intent but in case they weren't able to prove the breaking and entering that's why they had the larceny count to show the taking of the goods.</text>

            <text syncTime="6792.329" offset="27272652">I would like to make clear Your Honors the question of what happened in the remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="6797.704" offset="27294177">On page 2 and 3 of the appendix filed with this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6802.932" offset="27315075">The third paragraph shows that on June 30, 1966, the defendant challenged the array of the grand jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="6812.079" offset="27351646">In other words, he exercised his right to have his burglary conviction set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="6817.502" offset="27373380">It was until two months later as revealed on page 3 of the appendix that he was indicted on the larceny as well as the burglary conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="6828.747" offset="27418311">So it cannot be said on the basis of this record that at the time he made his election which was June 30, 1966 that he knew of the dire consequences that would face him if he took advantage of his First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="6843.654" offset="27477974">Therefore Your Honor, the second trial for the larceny as well as the burglary was unfair from the very beginning.</text>
