            <text syncTime="126.871" offset="610826">Yes, it's on appeal it started in state court of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.612" offset="629844">Yes, they came through the District Court and then the Court of Appeals and then we're here.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.736" offset="662340">I would like to comment first on the aspect of it having to do with the involuntary confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.738" offset="702360">This is a -- as I understand involuntary confession, the totality of circumstances doctrine really gets down to the question of common sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.133" offset="747917">Whether or not the accused gave up some right that he had and whether or not he was coerced and whether or not individual can be coerced under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.916" offset="795042">In brief to kept suited here, we have 19-year-old Negro boy, who was on the woods fishing, a 15-year-old white married girl comes along and whether he seduced or not is open to speculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.239" offset="852302">In any event, they entered into two acts and as they were coming back down out of the woods, it game warden who was unbeknown either one up in the woods halted them and charged at that point, this young boy took a pistol and shot the game warden.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.333" offset="924714">He apparently lost his head if the evidence is correct because and he took the officer's pistol and emptied it and then he was charged with cutting him with a knife some 55 feet to the woods.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.946" offset="979153">A lot of unusual circumstances like, it's a small boy and a 200-pound game warden, no blood on the boy but the game warden really bloody.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.354" offset="1020740">But then we get on into the confession part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.633" offset="1037876">He was immediately apprehended at the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.957" offset="1051251">Very shortly thereafter, the girl ran out on the woods and she hide and a two police officer happen to hear, and came in and apprehended him.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.006" offset="1087404">The state troopers came in, the local sheriff's organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.285" offset="1100466">There was some 20 police officers at there immediately and at that time, according to the record, the police captain, or the state trooper captain said, he's told him he didn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.273" offset="1160443">The girl was brought forward and she said that's him then according to the boy, he and the captain had some conversation to the effect in one occasion, “if you don't confess, I'm going to turn loose on you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="277.150" offset="1211956">Prior to them getting the atmosphere was building up all this time and that one of these police officers had has it gun out, said, “How old are you boy?”</text>
            <text syncTime="288.097" offset="1255737">He told them, he said, "You're old enough to die."</text>
            <text syncTime="289.984" offset="1263261">He said, "Run, I haven't killed any Negro all day.”</text>
            <text syncTime="293.467" offset="1277262">With this sort of atmosphere building up all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.400" offset="1292936">Their meeting that took three cars to transport him not back to his home but across the river onward to Morgan County.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.221" offset="1328253">Then the police officers come in, the two of them, the interrogator and the captain, and one of them has a hidden microphone and a tape recorder and you can hear those, if you listen to the tape, you could hear the anonymous sound of the jail doors opened and closing which means that nothing had gone on until they turn that tape on and at that time, we get out.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.023" offset="1423444">This is the first question.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.519" offset="1433475">“Then and now, you understand what we're doing?</text>
            <text syncTime="334.882" offset="1442879">We just want to talk to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.878" offset="1450924">We want you to tell us the truth about everything that happened today.”</text>
            <text syncTime="341.842" offset="1470777">Now, that's all the one that he had.</text>
