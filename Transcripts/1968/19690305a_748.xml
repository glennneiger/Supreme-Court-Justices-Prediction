            <label>Mr. Henry N. Herndon, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="11.577" offset="149713">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.135" offset="163924">This is a murder case in which the defendant's conviction of first degree murder was reversed by the Delaware Supreme Court for a trial de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.618" offset="201853">He was tried again after this Court's decision in Miranda and convicted of second degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.283" offset="232469">The Delaware Supreme Court subsequently entered a judgment affirming that conviction, and this Court granted certiorari to review that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.421" offset="269040">Two issues are raised in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.600" offset="281788">First, are the standards of Miranda applicable to all trials including retrials commenced after the decision was announced?</text>
            <text syncTime="54.024" offset="319509">Secondly, does the warrantless search of a suspects home based solely upon the consent of his co-occupant, violate the suspect's rights under the Fourth Amendment where he was physically present and immediately to give or withhold his consent, and where the purpose of the search was to obtain evidence not against his co-occupant, but against he suspect himself?</text>
            <text syncTime="83.487" offset="437269">The facts are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.149" offset="443956">Indeed, the statement of the case in the brief of the respondent is identical to that in the petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.245" offset="472377">The very and very summary form of the facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.432" offset="485125">On the morning of March 17, 1965, officers of the Wilmington, Delaware Police Department were called to investigate in apparent homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.652" offset="525981">The victim was found in a junkyard.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.275" offset="536430">Subsequent examination of the body by an assistant medical examiner disclosed that the victim had died sometime the prior evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.773" offset="574464">The petitioner and a companion had been observed on the street in the vicinity of that junkyard on that prior evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.129" offset="607901">They had been apprehended and taken to the police station where they were questioned by a Sergeant Maloney and subsequently released.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.533" offset="641546">Sergeant Maloney's name will come again.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.415" offset="653040">Between 9 and 10 o'clock on the morning of the March the 17th, that is the day after the initial apprehension.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.768" offset="682402">Sergeant Maloney went with four other officers to the home of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.629" offset="701837">His purpose was to see if the petitioner and his companion of the prior evening were there.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.095" offset="723780">The petitioner's lady friend, Ms. Marshall, answered the door and Sergeant Maloney indeed asked if Thornton Jenkins, the petitioner was present.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.470" offset="761292">The petitioner and his companion, his lady friend and three other persons, being all of those present in the house were apprehended at that time and taken to the detective division of the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.518" offset="813432">A bit of geography might be of assistance here.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.809" offset="826598">It seems that all of the county and municipal functions in the New Castle, Delaware are taking care of in a single building called the Public Building, which has at one end the city functions and at the other end, its county functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.261" offset="888456">The police station is located in the city end of that Public Building.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.595" offset="909772">At the police station, the petitioner was placed in a so called recording room located in the detective division.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.994" offset="939342">At 11 o'clock that morning, he was charged with night prowling.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.711" offset="958255">At 11:40 that morning, Sergeant Maloney, according to his testimony, advised the petitioner's lady friend of and his words “her rights” and requested permission to search the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.176" offset="1008097">She told him that he could search the house, which he then did, discovering of junk and clothing which were seized and later introduced into evidence at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.151" offset="1048012">I'll return when we come to the subject of the validity of this search to some more specific facts on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.229" offset="1084270">Now, later that same afternoon at 1:15 P.M., the petitioner was formally charged with fourth degree burglary and murder in the first degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.159" offset="1120005">Subsequently at 7 P.M., an incriminating written statement was obtained from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.902" offset="1142993">The purpose of this confession was of course to verify what the police officers had already concluded, namely that the petitioner was that person, or at least one of them who had committed the homicide then under investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.390" offset="1196910">Although, the evidence is conflicting upon what warnings were given to the petitioner and when they were given regarding his Fifth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.221" offset="1232227">For the petitioner for example, insist that he was not given any warnings until after he had signed the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.790" offset="1254484">It is clear that he was not advised of his right to have counsel supplied to him in the event he wished and was enable to afford counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.734" offset="1290324">Timely motions to suppress both the products of the search and the statement were filed both before and during the trials and were denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.022" offset="1327417">Petitioner's first trial began in January of 1966, and his more recent trial in October of '67.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.704" offset="1366183">It was the petitioner's second trial in October of '67 which poses the first issue raised here.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.642" offset="1397948">Following his initial conviction, the Delaware Supreme Court reversed for several reasons, none of them relating to the petitioner's statement, and in so doing directed that although the new trial was to be de novo, the standards proscribed by Miranda were not to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.149" offset="1463986">Johnson held that Miranda would apply only to trials begun after that decision, namely Miranda, was announced.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.995" offset="1491362">It was not specifically concerned with and did not expressly hold whether a retrial was among the trials in which Miranda was to be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.924" offset="1535039">For four major reasons, we submit that the admissibility of a criminal defendant's incriminating statement at a retrial should be measured by the same gauge as any other defendant going to trial at the same time, very briefly, those reasons are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.431" offset="1605047">First, the purpose of the Miranda Rule is to enhance the reliability of the fact finding process at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.010" offset="1635453">Now, that purpose could not be fully implemented if it were applicable only to some trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.100" offset="1663770">Now here, we think that the contrasting treatment in Stovall of the way Gilbert rules is enlightening.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.566" offset="1693654">There of course, the critical time was fixed as the time of the confrontation.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.101" offset="1711731">The time when the identification took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.247" offset="1732315">Here, the time was fixed at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.055" offset="1747571">Similarly, in this Court's recent decision in Fuller versus Alaska announcing the applicability of the Lee versus Florida rule, once again, the time was fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.811" offset="1794591">Not the time that the officers obtained the evidence in violation of Section 605 of the Federal Communication Act, but at the time of trial and once again however, no distinction being made as to the types of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.968" offset="1859271">But certainly would seem that if the rule in Lee versus Florida, which -- in which -- as to which the Court said that it doesn't go to the enhancement of the fact finding process.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.974" offset="1903261">The trial is going to be applicable at trials subsequent to the time that decision was announced.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.848" offset="1930742">It would seem anomalous to not apply at least in the retrial context, a rule which does to the core of the fact finding process.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.098" offset="1967731">Second, our second reason is this, in fixing the extent to which there maybe full effectuation of the individual's Fifth Amendment rights at trial, the results of his prior in-custody interrogation may and frequently are determinative.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.228" offset="2032306">It is difficult if not impossible to distinguish between the exercise of those rights during an in-custody interrogation and during trial, to the extent they have been lost in the interrogation process they can not be fully exercised at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.378" offset="2096880">The choice of whether or not to testify may then not be as a practical matter, one which is open to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.483" offset="2129272">Third reason is this, there is a seeming impairment of judicial integrity in sanctioning the simultaneous trials of different persons in adjoining courts but by different standards and perhaps, it is reading too much into Johnson, but it appears to have as one of its purposes the implementation of the Miranda's protections as soon as possible, but at the same time minimizing any disruptive effects which would be caused by its application.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.558" offset="2241599">That there would be some disruption is apparent, because Johnson would not exclude or would exclude from evidence that those confessions which were obtained either prior to the announcement of Miranda, or indeed after, ff they were in compliance with Miranda standards provided that no trial of any kind had been commenced by that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.812" offset="2342640">And fourth, there is an obvious point and perhaps too obvious that where Johnson uses the words trials, that's exactly what was meant, and no exclusion of all trials, except a defendant's first appearance at the bar was intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.393" offset="2404916">Most of the decision which are cited in all of the briefs, including that of the amicus Attorney General State of New York, on that or supporting the decision or in accord with the decision of the Delaware Supreme Court in this case, pick the critical word as cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.124" offset="2479835">And what they have done with this word is sometimes very interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.694" offset="2494151">For example, in the case of Boone versus State, I take that in that correction, State versus Branch, a North Carolina decision and the Court there found that the word case was determinative and how that a case begins at the time of the in-custody interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.022" offset="2563427">And I suggest that that gives substantial warping to the Johnson decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.873" offset="2594879">I'd like to make one or two brief comments upon the brief of the amicus curiae.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.028" offset="2615463">First he urged that -- the amicus urges that the New York courts have relied upon the non-applicability of Miranda in reversing subsequent cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.880" offset="2654856">We would suggest that the cases were reversed because they had either been wrongly decided or for some other error committed during the course at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.494" offset="2685367">Secondly, it's argued that Miranda should not, and I'm quoting, “be applied to past convictions merely because a retrial is ordered.”</text>
            <text syncTime="653.645" offset="2717968">I would suggest that if a retrial is ordered, there is no past conviction but only a future trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.440" offset="2745135">Finally, the amicus contends that the primary aim of Miranda was to change the circumstances of interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.685" offset="2770108">I would suggest that that simply is not what -- that is one of the purposes, but is not the primary purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.679" offset="2798111">We turn now to the search and seizure question.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.434" offset="2809083">And there, I think some additional facts maybe of assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.908" offset="2827055">The petitioner and his lady friend, Leona Marshall, had lived together as man and wife for about three or four years prior to his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.177" offset="2860074">They had lived in the house where the petitioner was apprehended for a period of anywhere from, according to here testimony, two of those years to perhaps nine months according to the landlord.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.193" offset="2908139">Between 9 and 10 o'clock on the morning of March 17, some five officers of the Wilmington Police Department went to the petitioner's home to apprehend the petitioner and his companion of the prior evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.924" offset="2959026">Sergeant Maloney knocked on the front door, Ms. Marshall still dressed in a house coat, answered the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.916" offset="2987029">Sergeant Maloney asked for the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.132" offset="2995911">The people in the house were then collected in one of the rooms, which I think Sergeant Maloney described as a dining room, where Ms. Marshall observed the petitioner's companion being directed to lean against the wall and being patted down.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.952" offset="3051186">She was told to get some clothes on and testified if she was advised that the people in the house were going downtown.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.300" offset="3076577">They were taken in to police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.504" offset="3085354">All of those apprehended, except for the petitioners and his companion, were seated on a bench immediately outside the detective division portion of the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.791" offset="3126523">The petitioner was taken inside and placed in a so called recording room, which is a separate room within the larger confine of the detective division.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.193" offset="3164139">Sergeant Maloney thereafter sought Ms. Marshall's permission to search the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.313" offset="3180648">The record is clear that at that time, Sergeant Maloney had Ms. Marshall in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.229" offset="3204263">He knew that the petitioner lived at the house to be search.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.523" offset="3217429">He knew that the petitioner was one of the two prime suspects in the homicide investigation then being conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.978" offset="3243238">He knew that the petitioner was present in the recording room.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.212" offset="3256195">He proposed to conduct the search to obtain evidence of the petitioner's guilt to the homicide, and he made no effort whatsoever to obtain the petitioner's consent to the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.978" offset="3299244">For her part, Ms. Marshall had a limited comprehension of what the search was all about and what her rights were.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.064" offset="3323591">Basically, she testified that she just didn't know what it was all about because the police didn't tell her.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.873" offset="3346892">She didn't know that she was not required to permit a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.152" offset="3359953">She thought the police could the property simply because they wanted to, and I think it's -- I should say to that she assumed that they could just get a search warrant by some process that she didn't understand, but that they could get one.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.162" offset="3427976">But any event, as a result, she did permit the search for no reason really other than the police asked here to.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.940" offset="3459114">The search therefore was without a warrant and was not conducted incident to a lawful arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.898" offset="3478967">The sole basis for its legitimacy was the acquiescence of Ms. Marshall, petitioner's co-occupant in the request of the police for permission to search and that --</text>

            <text syncTime="906.003" offset="3727339">These -- both these points had been dealt with at the first trial and had been rejected in the first appeal by the Delaware Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.129" offset="3771852">The acquiescence of Ms. Marshall, we suggest, does not measure up to the requirements of the Fourth Amendment for two basic reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.440" offset="3805184">First of all, her positive response to the request for permission of search was not made with any real comprehension of what her Fourth Amendment rights were.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.081" offset="3843741">And second, irrespective of whether Ms. Marshall's permission to search effectively waived her own rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.848" offset="3870804">We submit that she could not waive the petitioner's rights, and even if it is assumed that if that a co-occupant simply because he is a co-occupant, can waive another's Fourth Amendment protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.471" offset="3921272">The search here was nevertheless unreasonable where it was the petitioner, who was the prime murder suspect, where it was him against whom evidence was being sought and where he was immediately available to give her with all that consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.231" offset="3976338">Common to both reasons is a precept that a warrantless search is in violation of the constitution, unless it can be demonstrated as being within one of the well defined exceptions to the general requirement that a search must rest upon a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.046" offset="4039555">Necessity may justify a search in certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.072" offset="4055646">But absent necessity, a warrantless search must be supported by valid consent, as to the first reasons, the insufficiency of Ms. Marshall's consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.090" offset="4099741">Like the Fifth Amendment, the Fourth -- the aim of the Fourth is in part certainly to avoid any compulsion upon the individual to incriminate him self.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.000" offset="4135372">Evidence of a suspected crime whether from the suspect's own mouth or whether from his possessions or his home have the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.443" offset="4169122">If a waiver of this right is to be relied upon, then there does not appear to be any justification for surrounding that right with a lesser degree of protection then is the case for the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.358" offset="4216769">And thus, if a waiver is to be relied upon, it must be established that Ms. Marshall fully comprehended what her rights were before her consent to the search can be characterized as effective to support the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.713" offset="4270268">And the burden here of establishing that waiver is upon the State. In this case, we submit that the burden has not been sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.563" offset="4305586">As to the second reason, as far as petitioner is aware, this Court has never upheld the validity of a third-party consent to a search -- let me state that in other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.713" offset="4366190">As far as the petitioner is aware, this Court has never specifically held that a third-party effectively waived the Fourth Amendment rights of a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.386" offset="4412897">Once it is recognized that the Fourth Amendment protects people and not simply places or things, and that the rights of the individual are personal rights, then it is difficult to accept that those rights may be dismembered by one who has absolutely no interest in their protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.358" offset="4484786">Anything else such as the possession and control rule relied upon the Delaware courts and many of the lower courts, necessarily -- lower federal courts -- necessarily involves an analysis of relative and competing property interests, and makes them determinative of who can consent to the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.298" offset="4564616">The waiver therefore must be by the person whose rights are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.550" offset="4581543">Either he must waive it in person or through an agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.093" offset="4595754">But in either case, the waiver or authority to waive must be explicit and this we suggest is exactly what Stoner teaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.759" offset="4626369">I think we would all be shocked and reject out of hand the notion that a father could waive his son's right to a -- to counsel in a trial and submit him not a plea of guilty of the court for sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.395" offset="4676942">And I don't think we would accept a wife's asserted waiver of her husband's Fifth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.329" offset="4704737">This situation, we submit is really no different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.000" offset="4723336">In a narrow sense, it is perhaps not essential for the disposition of this particular case that the third-party consent issue be met head on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.509" offset="4761370">This search was unreasonable by any standard despite Ms. Marshall's consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.305" offset="4784567">Advert once more to the general rule that a search warrant is required, except where necessity changes that circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.943" offset="4819153">Absent a warrant, the requirement of necessity in fact even though the decisions and petitioner fully appreciates this, the decisions use the word reasonable and unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.305" offset="4860635">If the requirement of necessity is not met, then the warrant is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.114" offset="4883832">Here, there was no reason, no justification for not either seeing a warrant or seeking the petitioner's consent and the failure to have sought that consent in this particular instance where he was immediately available to give or withhold it, all that Sergeant Maloney had to do was open the door and ask him, is what makes this search unreasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1558.475" offset="6337285">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.928" offset="6355048">The first question which we are here to argue is whether Miranda is applicable to retrials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.293" offset="6384515">Now five circuits and nine States differ with Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.491" offset="6405308">We've got five that agree with us, five States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.376" offset="6420877">But out of those 14 forums that differ with Delaware, only one decision, and that's the California decision of People versus Dorothy, has anymore than a token discussion of this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.817" offset="6478660">The 13 other forums rely on the one-word trial in this Court's decision in Johnson versus New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.047" offset="6519515">Now, we submit that the answer to this question does not lie in one little word used in one case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.088" offset="6559744">Now, the Johnson decision is important, and it is important for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.803" offset="6582627">Number one, all of its language gives guidance as to the answer to this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.748" offset="6610317">And number two, Johnson is important because the decision that this Court reaches in this case should be able to be reconciled with the Johnson decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.183" offset="6660054">And now in addition to Johnson, I think we must apply logic, common sense and even look at some other cases which lead us to the answer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1743.149" offset="7075924">It's our -- it's our position that a retrial is not a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.254" offset="7096404">It is merely a continuation or an extension of the first trial and that's why the trial really begun back in '65 and not in '67 for you hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.982" offset="7143320">I think another way to point this out would be to say if this Court started to write the decision in this case in March of 1969, and after working on it for in week, you tore it up, then you come back in April of '69 and start to write it again.</text>

            <text syncTime="1798.910" offset="7299009">The -- I might add that the only thing which is new about a new trial is possibly the jury and well, the jury is new, possibly the judge might be new as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.493" offset="7353344">But it certainly is not a new trial as far as the parties go.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.922" offset="7367032">The defense knows what the prosecution's evidence is going to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.934" offset="7383124">They know the basis of the admissibility of that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.287" offset="7396498">They know what witnesses are going to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.501" offset="7409351">They know about the credibility of those witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.082" offset="7423666">Certainly, a lot easier to cross-examine the second time than the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.453" offset="7441220">They know how the judge is going to rule on evidentiary questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.603" offset="7457834">So, a retrial is really not new trial, except for the fact that the jury treats it as a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.122" offset="7483852">The jury hears it for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.698" offset="7518124">Now, since all these other forums play such heavy reliance on Johnson, I'd like to just look a little bit at some of the other language in the Johnson decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.016" offset="7571414">First, there's language in the Johnson decision that Escobido and Miranda should apply to cases commenced after those decisions were announced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.471" offset="7613210">Now both words are important here cases, commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.679" offset="7630137">Now, New Jersey Supreme Court in Bigliano in discussing this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.445" offset="7649155">They say a retrial after appellate reversal is not a new case, but simply a continuance of the same case looking toward a final judgment of either acquittal or conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.768" offset="7698474">I think this is what I just expressed in answer to Mr. Justice Marshall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.373" offset="7728880">When a case commences, it's my view that the case commences even before the previous trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.961" offset="7775169">The Supreme Court in Maryland in Boone, they put the commencing point at the previous trial in the new North Carolina Supreme Court in Branch, they put it at the trial, or no, at the interrogation in the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.060" offset="7827623">I place the point of a case commencing at the first time the defendant is taken before a judicial office to set bail, whether that be United States commissioner or justice of the peace, or a magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.112" offset="7883839">And the basis of that is because this Court, since its inception has always held that to have a case, there has to be a controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.563" offset="7917589">Now to have a controversy, there has to be two sides, and the first point at which both sides represented before some judicial authority would be when the committing taken before a magistrate to set bail or for arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.199" offset="7976208">Now, after the commencing, we go through all the preliminary hearing, all part of the same case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.876" offset="7998882">We go through grand jury indictment, still part of the same case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.249" offset="8012361">Trial by petty jury, part of the same case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1979.959" offset="8023228">Mr. Conner, I hate to stick to my point but it seems to me your court said on page 56 “According to the his opinion of the court, the Jenkins conviction of murder of in the first degree, it must be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2015.486" offset="8165334">But it goes to what is the definition of a new trial.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jay H. Conner</label>
            <text syncTime="2022.703" offset="8194173">They did say new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.229" offset="8204309">But I'm just pointing out, there is a big and a great difference between a trial tried for the second time and a trial tried for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.021" offset="8255404">Now, there's some additional language in Johnson which is important and that language says “Future defendants will benefit fully from our standards governing in-custody interrogation, when you're talking about the Miranda and Escobido standards.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.187" offset="8320084">Now certainly, defendant Jenkins who was arrested back in March of 1965 was not a new or future defendant in October 1967 when he was tried for the second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.719" offset="8390196">Now Johnson -- in Johnson this Court also points out that the police shouldn't be punished for not following standards which were not standard at the time they acted and this Court differentiates from the map in Wolf Doctrine where the police did have the Wolf standards, but didn't follow them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.688" offset="8506075">So, if we consider that on a retrial, the law enforcement and the prosecution can not use the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.736" offset="8546304">This would really be to punish the police for acting in accordance with the set standards at the time they took -- at the time they took the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.447" offset="8597191">Now, I mentioned at the beginning that this decision should be reconcilable with the Johnson decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.010" offset="8647450">Now, if this Court determines, as my friend asked that Miranda is applicable to a retrial, then this decision can not be reconcilable with the Johnson decision, because it's not reconcilable with the language of case commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.812" offset="8738670">Now, if the Court accepts our position that it should not apply to a retrial, it is reconcilable with the language at case commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.091" offset="8779734">It can also be reconcilable with the language trials begun, by ruling that a retrial is merely an extension and not a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.627" offset="8821844">It can differ with the Supreme Court Delaware, or it could say by the language in Johnson “We intended this to mean a trial for the first time.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.328" offset="8876701">So, it can be reconciled with Johnson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.364" offset="8900838">Now, this Court is long been concerned about the administration of justice and this is obvious not only from Johnson but many other decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.184" offset="8956113">Many cases are going to be affected if it's ruled that Miranda is applicable to a retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.963" offset="8999267">The amicus brief indicates that many New York cases will be affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.622" offset="9017866">In Delaware, this is the only case that I know that will be affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.041" offset="9035525">There may be one or two in the federal habeas corpus, but I'm not aware of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.503" offset="9061334">But in this particular case, Jenkins if this confession is out, we can not prosecute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.731" offset="9086307">We don't have enough evidence and it's one -- now two years later, it's too late to go back and dig up or come up with some fresh evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.875" offset="9134895">Now, counsel is probably saying “Let's not excuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.698" offset="9146180">The police should've done a thorough job the first time.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.616" offset="9161853">This is an argument, but realistically speaking the last 10 years of course there's been a great increase in crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.987" offset="9195290">But there hasn't been a ratable increase in the number of man that man our police departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.832" offset="9226742">Though the police when they're investigating a crime, they're forced to go out get enough evidence which will be legally admissible, in which will be sufficient if legally admissible to obtain a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.928" offset="9291107">Then they have to get back at on the street and continue on other investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.347" offset="9308766">They don't have the manpower and they don't have the time to put together a perfect case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2380.850" offset="9626728">I might say, I mentioned the California case of People versus Dorothy and in California they have a statute which reads something like this, “The granting of a new trial places the parties in the same position as if the trial -- as if no trial had been had.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.222" offset="9724217">This is a very similar to the discussion which I just had with Mr. Justice Marshall and of course the California courts are bound by this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.785" offset="9774477">And this is one explanation why they put a little more discussion in about the Johnson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.797" offset="9806555">As I pointed out, I don't agree with the statute because the new trial doesn't really place the parties in the same position as if no trial had been had for the reasons that have been previously mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.480" offset="9857337">But it is also interesting to note that the Dorothy case in California, the California Supreme Court ruled that the marijuana had been properly admitted into evidence and I feel that you can put the marijuana in the possession of somebody that the court may have felt that this was enough evidence for them to get a conviction the second time without the confession.</text>

            <text syncTime="2552.128" offset="10311868">That is my recollection also, and my next point which was I going to discuss exactly was the Stovol case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.216" offset="10360247">And of course Stovol held that as far as the lineup rules are concerned, the way Gilbert rules that it's the date of confrontation, which is the critical date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.911" offset="10411029">But there are some other language in the Stovol decision which if found interesting and that language was, “We conclude that for these purposes, no distinction is justified between convictions now final and convictions at various.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.576" offset="10497651">And I emphasize various “stages of trial and direct review,” various stages of trial and direct review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.044" offset="10551568">Now likewise in the confession area, logic dictates that no distinction is justified between the defendant who confessed prior to June 13, 1966 was convicted, sentenced -- served his sentence and the defendant, who also confessed prior to June 13, 1966 was convicted, but gets a new trial for reasons not related to the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.984" offset="10687300">Secondly, logic dictates that the rules as far as rate of counsel should not differ, as far as the retrial is concerned for identification cases and for confession cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.116" offset="10763786">And thirdly, and this may be reiterated and repetitious but it should be emphasized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.853" offset="10802761">The police and law enforcement should not be punished for something that wasn't the law at the time they acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.709" offset="10866186">Now, this concludes my portion of the argument which I want to deal with, Miranda applying to retrials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.392" offset="10900982">I would just like to go briefly to what time is left into a discussion of the principles that are involved in the search question or the search aspect of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.566" offset="10969631">Before going in this, perhaps the factual setting should be made clear, Mr. Herndon alluded to the fact that they had lived together for some years as man and wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.362" offset="11032848">Delaware does not recognize common law marriages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.488" offset="11061373">It is true these people had lived together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.680" offset="11078092">But the landlord said and then testified that he rented theses premises solely to Leona Marshall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.111" offset="11111842">As far as he was concerned, she was the tenant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.045" offset="11123545">He had never heard of Thornton Jenkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.434" offset="11145070">It should also be pointed out that Thornton Jenkins was arrested back in March 17th, 1965, and when this case came to trial in January of '66, Leona Marshall was still residing as tenant at the same premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.518" offset="11217481">So, there is no dispute as to who is the tenant and who has the property interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.063" offset="11247574">Our Supreme Court used the term joint occupants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.245" offset="11292400">Now, Mr. Herndon asked this Court to rule that in no case can a defendant be bound when a third-party consents to the premises or to the premises that the third-party owns or occupies or has the possessory interest then to this search.</text>

            <text syncTime="3326.896" offset="13410931">Mr. Chief Justice, if I may respond very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.284" offset="13424515">As to the Johnson argument, I think that the position of the State of Delaware points up the problem in using the word case as the word of art, rather than the word trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.781" offset="13470490">The decisions in many States vary as to when a case or indeed a trial begins.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.272" offset="13488462">Some cases say that it begins with the interrogation of the defendant, others at the time of a preliminary hearing, others at the time of indictment, others at the time of arraignment and pleas, still others when the jury is called into the box for examination and still others when the jury is sworn, so that that problem has to be faced as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.715" offset="13562232">It seems to us of the use of the word trial is a clearly understood and well recognized word which provides fine degree of definiteness and one that should be easily followed despite the problems some courts have had with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.305" offset="13616567">It is suggested that this would punish the police for what they have done properly at the time they obtained the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.059" offset="13643630">This is necessarily the consequence of Johnson in any case where in no trial of any type had been started, unless the critical word is case and unless the case means the time -- the time the statement was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.650" offset="13713951">It was further pointed that this punishes the police and that there was no anticipation of the problem, and it was too late to go out and get any other evidence unless simply like to advert to the petitioner's motion to suppress in this case, in December of '65 which included the ground and certainly warned the police at that time some few months after the event that the defendant, this is the quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.887" offset="13802872">“The defendant was not adequately afforded the right to console with legal counsel, and legal counsel was not assigned to represent the defendant prior to the time as purported a statement was obtained, thereby depriving the defendant of his right to counsel.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.674" offset="13854072">So, there was a warning at that time that if there was a problem and if there was further evidence, that was the time we've then.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.321" offset="13880613">As to the search issue, I think the -- if I was understood to make the representation or argument to the Court that in no case can a third-party consent to a search vis-à-vis the defendant, then I didn't state it well at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.274" offset="13944456">What I did say was that where the purpose of the search is to obtain evidence against a defendant, then the consent of someone who simply has a proprietary interest in the property to be searched is not sufficient, and that is my point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.065" offset="14003597">I have some concern about the -- there an aversion to some of this in-plain view cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.843" offset="14022719">The obvious distinction there is we don't have a search, and thereby the problem doesn't arise.</text>
