            <text syncTime="26.581" offset="209690">The issue in this case is essentially whether or not an employer can make a scholarship grant to an employee with that scholarship grant being excludable from gross income under the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.198" offset="288162">The Government's position is that it cannot because Congress expressly stated that any continuing salary arrangement was not to have attached to it tax exempt consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.488" offset="377292">This statement on behalf of the Government is repeated throughout its brief as though the constant repetition would add some validity to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.922" offset="419088">The legislative history however does not support the statement that a scholarship which may in fact be labeled a continuing salary arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.412" offset="501008">The legislative history does not support that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.100" offset="527757">The 1954 Code in which Section 117 was inserted with respect to scholarships and fellowships was new with the 1954 Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.899" offset="574986">There was no specific provision of the Internal Revenue Code previous to that time.</text>

            <label>Mr. James C. Larrimer</label>
            <text syncTime="135.348" offset="644786">There's another circuit, I think it's the Fourth Circuit if I'm not mistaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.200" offset="664221">There are at least two circuits which are in conflict with the decision of the Third Circuit in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.490" offset="705285">The Congress at the time of enacting the Section 117 recognized the state of confusion which existed as to the tax consequences of the scholarship and fellowship grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.853" offset="762755">It said about to attempt to provide what it labeled a clear cut method of determining the tax consequences of these grants without the necessity of deciding each case, case-by-case.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.770" offset="830464">It did so under the format of Section 117 in which it set forth specifically that a scholarship at an educational institution shall not be included in gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.169" offset="896084">It also provided that a fellowship shall not be included in gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.628" offset="925863">And then, considering the compensatory possibilities of these grants, it inserted limitations in the code in Section 117.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.060" offset="979571">First, it provided with respect to scholarships and it's recognized by Congress at this point that scholarships must be at an educational institution as it is defined in the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.382" offset="1044877">Now, the Internal Revenue Code specifically defines an educational institution as an education -- as an institution which has a regular faculty and a regular student body and a regular curriculum.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.394" offset="1112900">So, Congress intended that a scholarship relate only to a student at an educational institution.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harris Weinstein</label>
            <text syncTime="1679.760" offset="6822431">Mr. Chief Justice, if I may quickly deal with several points particularly once of record and of other decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.987" offset="6851271">In response to Mr. Justice Harlan's question, the cases and conflict are in the Fifth and Sixth Circuit and in the Court of Claims, and there are two cases, one in the tenth and a per curiam in the fourth that would be believed conflicting rationale and they're discussed in our brief beginning at page 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.123" offset="6919816">In terms of the relationship between Westinghouse and the employer during the leave, there's a requirement for periodic progress reports, and this is discussed I believe in the testimony at page 18 of the record at least, it maybe in other places.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.517" offset="6973419">In terms of Westinghouse's rights against the employer -- employee who defaults on its obligation to come back, we set out that Pennsylvania cases which we think at least give a right to sue for the actual expenditures made on behalf of the employee during the leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.336" offset="7044681">In terms of limitations on amount, respondents now say there's a rule of reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.565" offset="7073625">Congress didn't even think things would go that far because as we pointed out in our brief, Congress expected that this would be relatively small amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.390" offset="7108942">If I -- although my time is up, if I may just speak to this question of the relationship of the thesis topic to Westinghouse's program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.253" offset="7144364">At page 104 of the record which is Westinghouse's regulations on this subject, it encourages employees to find topics of technical interest to Bettis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.448" offset="7201207">In the testimony at pages 61 and 62, a Westinghouse official testifies on this question of thesis review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.435" offset="7237151">In the first line of page 62, he uses the word “relevance” in determining the relationship between thesis topic and Westinghouse work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.626" offset="7273827">Pages 74 and 75, the responsible official of the Atomic Energy Commission speaks of job relatedness in terms of the connection with the thesis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.507" offset="7313429">But in closing, I would just like to say that we do not depend just on the fact that the thesis topic is reviewed, but this thesis topic review and the entire program is part of an overall package of compensation the Westinghouse and the A.E.C. have designed to obtain people like the respondents for six or seven years, and the fifth year, they get this leave and this obligates them to return as in the case of one respondent for the sixth year, and the case of the other two for the sixth and seventh years and it is this obligation that to us is the keystone of this case.</text>
