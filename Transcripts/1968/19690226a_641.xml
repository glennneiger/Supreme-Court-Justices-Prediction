            <text syncTime="36.590" offset="249710">May it please the Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.139" offset="259950">I'm Charles Tessmer of Dallas, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.921" offset="271026">I represent Reyes Orozco, the petitioner, who stands convicted of murder upon circumstantial evidence by jury in the criminal District Court of Dallas County, Texas, with a penalty assessed that penal servitude of 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.782" offset="342497">This is a classic case, presenting a violation of the petitioner's rights under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.307" offset="396622">In this case, the petitioner was the prime murder suspect, had been so for four hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.397" offset="424939">At the time of his interrogation, he was under arrest, whether legal or not is not important.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.864" offset="450853">He was surrounded in his bedroom by four armed officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.253" offset="468407">He was either asleep or had just been awakened when the officers entered without his invitation or consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.831" offset="506650">In this case, no new trails in the criminal law need be blazed by this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.654" offset="534026">In this case, no interpretation of prior case law need take place by this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.307" offset="560567">What we have here is a simple refusal of the Texas court of criminal appeals to follow this simple words and cautions of Miranda, Escobedo, and cases involving that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.220" offset="628276">The facts in this case are quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.054" offset="639561">The deceased was found dead at around midnight at 12:30 by a uniformed policeman.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.788" offset="662549">A crowd had gathered.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.464" offset="669236">He was slumped over the wheel of a car at a café.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.114" offset="687835">After some investigation, the detectives learned that there was a possible eyewitness named Mary Matas.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.346" offset="712808">The police found Mary Matas, arrested him, took him downtown to point out where a woman had been led out of the car who was present at the scene also.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.539" offset="761501">Then, they have Mary Matas direct them to Lemmon Avenue, some two or three miles from the center of the City of Dallas and there Mary Matas pointed out the house where his friend, the petitioner lived and the car that he was in that night.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.862" offset="822836">Then, the officers proceeded back downtown, put Mary Matas in jail for investigation of murder, and then after this belated attempt of some four hours, he went back to the house with three other officers, an uninvited entry was made, except that there was an invitation by an unidentified woman, and of course no consent there under Amos, Stover versus California where federal standards apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.119" offset="955852">What we have here is a simple case of this, the minute that Detective Brown got into their house, he admitted that when he said, what is your name and petitioner said, Reyes Orozco that he was under arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.210" offset="1016247">He was the prime suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.670" offset="1022098">This was no general inquiry at the scene of an unsolved crime, where threshold statements may be used or even res gestae and that the State of Texas makes no contention that we have here in threshold a statement or admission of guilt, or that we have a res gestae statement or whether Miranda applies there or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.329" offset="1104645">Here, we have a blatant violation of petitioner's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.620" offset="1117811">What happened?</text>

            <text syncTime="259.759" offset="1142366">Here's what happened to petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.487" offset="1153337">Mr. Brown said, what is your name?</text>
            <text syncTime="264.317" offset="1160652">Orozco.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.745" offset="1166399">Where you at the El Farleto Café last night, the murder scene?</text>
            <text syncTime="274.560" offset="1201612">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.724" offset="1201507">Do you own a gun?</text>
            <text syncTime="275.690" offset="1206105">Where is that gun?</text>
            <text syncTime="277.290" offset="1212583">And Brown himself admitted that it took two times of questions before petitioner said I will show you, or proceeded to show the officers where the gun was in the washing machine and another part of the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.313" offset="1268590">Now, those are the simple facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.391" offset="1276949">Now, what were the fruits of this interrogation?</text>
            <text syncTime="296.744" offset="1290324">Simply this, if petitioner had said I'm guilty, I did it, the facts develop from this interrogation were more damaging in this circumstantial evidence case than a direct confession signed, sealed, under oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.033" offset="1347480">What do they get from this interrogation?</text>
            <text syncTime="313.662" offset="1358033">An admission, he was at the murder scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.114" offset="1367855">Four hours after the officers knew there'd been homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.658" offset="1381961">Four hours after they knew this was the prime suspect, his own friend put him at the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.018" offset="1403486">His own friend pointed the house out, the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.085" offset="1419682">Secondly, do you own a gun?</text>
            <text syncTime="332.197" offset="1432116">Yes, I do.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.079" offset="1435669">No real admission there.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.755" offset="1442356">Many people owned guns and have a right to, in Texas in their own home.</text>

            <text syncTime="391.520" offset="1669413">At any rate, we find the product of that interrogation was simply this, the admission he was at the scene of a murder, the admission he owned a gun.</text>

            <text syncTime="411.050" offset="1747571">The murder weapon possibly? Ballistics testimony was offered at the trial showing that the body from the deceased, the bullet from that body match test bullets fired from that gun.</text>

            <text syncTime="777.280" offset="3212518">Where they familiar?</text>
            <text syncTime="778.653" offset="3217951">Boarding house, 4:30 in the morning, four armed officers around his bed and he's just been awaken from sleep, hardly, a familiar place not subject to police domination.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.449" offset="3269151">I can think of -- I can concede or think believe that the police station would be less dominating than your own bedroom under those circumstances at 4:30 in the morning, surrounded by four armed officers, no cautions, no warnings, nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.972" offset="3331218">I think that's the State of Texas main argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.814" offset="3346578">Secondly, they wish to elucidate and use the doctrine of fictitious waiver that although Mr. Barkley, the trial counsel objected and objected, and as for voir dire that he didn't draw the trial judge a motion picture of Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.573" offset="3421706">Now in answer to that, I would point out that we have had since Miranda and since it became effective, two statutes in the Texas Court of Criminal procedure that go further than Miranda, and require more warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.217" offset="3476250">They are namely Article 15.17 and Article 3022.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.713" offset="3498193">15.17 requires that he be taken before a magistrate as soon as possible, and there given the cautions, then a constitutionally admissible, admission or statement may be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.702" offset="3542183">Article 3022 provides that the officer who takes the statement must repeat and give the same warnings, and they go beyond Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.052" offset="3575620">So, there's no argument that can reasonably be made that the trial judge didn't know what Mr. Barkley's talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.456" offset="3601220">I think he certainly presumed to know the import of Miranda and the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.503" offset="3621386">Now, what do I mean by fictitious waiver argument?</text>
            <text syncTime="884.681" offset="3642075">Many decisions in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit have applied the doctrine and refused to accept it to racial discrimination in the selection of juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.304" offset="3680632">Most states required to make the motion beforehand, before you select the jury to quash it, and put in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.025" offset="3707486">Numerous decisions hold that it maybe may just laid his own appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.052" offset="3723577">You have here a constitutional right, a constitutional violation and therefore, state procedural grounds may not washout that right, eventhough it's admirable to have state criminal process move quickly, but where you have justice on one side and constitutional rights, now this magnitude unknown the other the question of whether you timely objected or you were just a little late, or you didn't grow a motion picture of the objection, I think that the decision in O'Conner versus Ohio is recognized that the constitutional right may not be waived on that basis, also in the decision of Fahy versus Connecticut where there was a violation of the petitions Fourth Amendment rights and he took the stand and admitted certain things, still the finding of the paint in the garage where he marked the swastika on the synagogue was a right he could complain about.</text>

            <text syncTime="1047.698" offset="4294196">He certainly did cut him off, overruled him and would not allow him a second voir dire of the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.131" offset="4315930">And Mr. Justice Marshall, all of these took place in the presence of the jury, which of course as lawyers, we all know can be very damaging where you are asserting constitutional rights in front of layman who don't understand there are certain rules to be availed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.983" offset="4375280">Now, I would further point out that in our petition for the writ, our supporting brief, we point out the Wong Sun decision, the Silverthorne Lumber Company versus U.S. and decisions of that appeal which present the fruit of the poison tree doctrine and certainly what came of this illegal interrogation, damaging admissions, I was at the scene of a murder, I want a gun, the gun itself and acting out a nonverbal confession in getting the gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.109" offset="4495757">It's like a reenactment of a murder scene by suspect, and the ballistics' evidence which follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.893" offset="4518954">So, I think that in view of the circumstances of this case, we simply have here a simple failure of our court of last resort of Texas to follow the simple words and guidelines set down by this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.810" offset="4594604">We therefore respectfully submit that this conviction should be reversed and a new trial awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.494" offset="4621354">In conclusion, I can think of no other case that presents a clear picture of the fictitious waiver doctrine as used to washout constitutional rights by some courts than Loubet against Bennett 365 F. 2d 695 of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit involving a state prosecution in the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.154" offset="4711946">If there are no questions, I have nothing further.</text>

            <text syncTime="2147.532" offset="8693530">By way of brief rejoinder, the record is not clear on the identity of the woman who admitted the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.630" offset="8717876">There was no evidence that she was landlady or whatever the case may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.752" offset="8742431">Further, I would like to point out briefly that when the objections were made numerously over some seven pages of the record by Mr. Barkley, he used the word “predicate” and predicate means what must be shown prior to using the evidence authenticating a document, proving up a letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.094" offset="8811708">Now certainly, any trial judge is presumed to know that a predicate for admissions these damaging must be a compliance with the caution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.384" offset="8844936">Further, had there been no objection at all by trial counsel, then I think the only waiver that you could you have in that situation would be that it was concurred in by the accused or at least it was trial strategy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.113" offset="8899793">In Henry versus Mississippi, the first submission, this Honorable Court held that Fourth Amendment rights weren't necessarily waived by failure of the Mississippi attorney to object, and I believe the case was remanded for a hearing to determine why he failed to object to an illegal search and seizure.</text>
