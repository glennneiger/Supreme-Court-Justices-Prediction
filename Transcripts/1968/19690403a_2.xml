            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">Number 2, Red Lion Broadcasting Company Inc.et al, petitioner versus Federal Communications Commission et al.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.278" offset="146536">Mr. Solicitor General?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="16.728" stopTime="302.643">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="16.728" offset="172345">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.696" offset="192199">Before resuming my argument, I would like to make a reference to one matter to which I referred yesterday afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.636" offset="232009">I raised question as to whether there was something in this exchange of letters between the commission and the Red Lion Broadcasting which constituted and ordered, which was properly subject for judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.924" offset="305152">I should point out that the question whether there was something reviewable there was presented by petition for rehearing en banc by the Government, which was joined in by the other side and that my reference there should be simply my own personal puzzlement as to what in these days constitutes a proper subject of judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.047" offset="437645">At the conclusion of the argument yesterday afternoon, I was referring to the suggestion that the personal attack regulations would inhibit actions by broadcasters.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.355" offset="522804">The inhibition I've suggested lies -- the suggestion of inhibition I contended, lies in a misapprehension of the status of the broadcaster.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.453" offset="579229">It based on the assumption that every minute of the time available to a broadcast licensee is his to use for his own personal financial profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.395" offset="635026">And I was arguing that his license allows him to use a public facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.247" offset="666373">It provides that it must be used for the public convenience and interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.328" offset="690719">If he doesn't meet the standard of the public interest, the commission may fail to renew his license, it can even cancel it.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.832" offset="728754">And certainly, the personal attack doctrine as an aspect of the fairness doctrine does no more than to say that he must use his privilege in this particular circumstance in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.239" offset="806390">His license comes to him burdened with a public obligation, and he is in no position to claim that he is inhibited if he is required to make a modest performance on the obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.228" offset="870337">Experience shows that there is little trouble under the fairness and personal attack doctrines with the great networks and the stations which they control.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.542" offset="919552">The problem arises mostly with the small independent stations as in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.085" offset="953720">As I've already indicated, there's no evidence here, no showing of any hardship, or even of lost of revenue by the station.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.865" offset="1004920">Mr. Robb in his argument yesterday admitted that there was a personal attack, so, there is no question here about the suggested vagueness of the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.328" offset="1054762">The only objection that the station made was to the granting of free time.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.573" offset="1075764">They made no suggestion as to a problem of scheduling.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.604" offset="1095826">Moreover, as has been indicated, they had a format.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.195" offset="1114216">They had a free speech hour each week when they could readily have putted in.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.083" offset="1137727">Indeed, many small stations play a great deal of music and an appropriate response to a personal attack could have been put on the air in place of a single recording.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.856" offset="1192793">The commission does not undertake to tell the station just where the response must be put as long as the station chose an effort to be fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.444" offset="1235216">The placing of the response is up to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.059" offset="1249635">If it can get a sponsor, it's free to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.843" offset="1264786">Otherwise, it must be on sustaining time.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.503" offset="1279415">But as I've indicated, that is part of the obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.713" offset="1296238">It undertakes when it accepts its license.</text>

            <text syncTime="302.643" offset="1315986">Was that all clear back at the time that this Red Lion episode occurred that it was the obligation of Red Lion to not only to give an opportunity to the person whose character have been attacked, but also do it at no expense to him?</text>

            <text syncTime="327.050" offset="1413580">Let me say in response to that Mr. Justice that the fairness premier had been published before this.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.267" offset="1446494">The fairness premier is essentially a digest of previous rulings of the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.709" offset="1472303">I think I'm right in my recollection that at least one of those rulings involved the question of free time.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.222" offset="1498321">It was not as explicit as it was in this exchange of letters, but I think it is inherent in the fairness doctrine.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="396.959" offset="1693299">But let me suggest to you Mr. Justice that paying for time on a 165 stations is pretty substantial burden to put on the person involved here, particularly when as this our submission, this is really the obligation of the station in meeting the statutory requirement of operating in the public interest which over the course of a long evolution has developed into the fairness doctrine and more specifically into the personal attack doctrine.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="433.859" offset="1840839">I understand your submission as to the importance and necessity of it's being free time, but I -- my question is as you understood I know was whether or not that was also clear back at the time of Red Lion broadcast.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="448.398" stopTime="584.436">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="448.398" offset="1899039">Not as clear as I would like to have it to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.918" offset="1917116">There was no -- nothing stated in bold face type that you must do this on free time if you can't get a sponsor.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.531" offset="1947523">I think it was understood and I don't think that Red Lion was surprised when the response came from the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.700" offset="1976257">Certainly, that is a part of the issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.939" offset="1993185">I think it would be unfortunate in the long run to have it said that "Well, you can reply if you can pay for it, or you can reply if you can get sponsor," that would seem to be a considerable hindrance on a free speech and the development of a robust debate which is the underlying objective of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.310" offset="2110631">It is our position that the objective of the fairness premier of the commission's action here is to implement the First Amendment, not to subvert it.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.749" offset="2172385">To induce the licensees to recognize their obligation under the amendments since they are utilizing a portion of a public facility, it has been argued that the First Amendment requires an opportunity for response in a situation like this, that in effect the United States would be denying free speech if there were no personal attack doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.007" offset="2281472">I don't go that far, but I do contend that the regulation here involved on these facts does implement the First Amendment, does protect the public's right to hear which is the underlying basis of the First Amendment, and tends towards encouraging robust in spirited debate in accordance with the thrust and objective of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.789" offset="2400590">And for these reasons, we would submit that the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case should be affirmed.</text>

          <heading>Argument of Roger Robb</heading>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="584.436" stopTime="585.869">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="584.436" offset="2443118">Mr. Robb?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="roger_robb" startTime="585.869" stopTime="959.688">
            <label>Mr. Roger Robb</label>
            <text syncTime="585.869" offset="2448865">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.600" offset="2463807">Referring briefly to the statement by the Solicitor General concerning whether or not this was a final order for which I thank him, I think that perhaps I might pledge that out a little bit by reference to the records.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.981" offset="2537368">Now, as has been indicated, when this case was first presented in the Court of Appeals to a panel consisting of Circuit Judges Miller, Fahy and Tamm, the question was raised as to whether or not the order involved was a final order.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.954" offset="2629214">At that time, the respondent commission was represented by Mr. Giller his general counsel and by Mr. Assistance Attorney General Turner of the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.137" offset="2693998">Judge Miller in his opinion said this in which appeared at page 84 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.156" offset="2730047">In considering this matter, we are confronted by the threshold question, whether the commission's letters of October 6 and December 9 were final orders from which an appeal maybe taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.429" offset="2791173">Pursuant to our invitation, the parties have submitted memoranda on the question in which they agreed that the commission's letters constitute final appealable orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.618" offset="2851882">However, Judge Miller and Judge Tamm held that the orders were not finally appealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.317" offset="2882706">Judge Fehy dissented in which he said, “All parties including the one against whom the ruling was made, understood the commission had decided finally that Red Lion was under obligation to comply with the fairness doctrine and had so notified the Red Lion.”</text>
            <text syncTime="714.747" offset="2964417">Thereafter, there was a motion for a rehearing en banc, in which again, the respondent was represented by Mr. Turner of Department of Justice, and as Judge Tamm points out in his opinion, final opinion, thereafter, the United States and the Federal Communications Commission petition for en banc rehearing of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.271" offset="3074550">In other words, at Mr. -- as had been pointed out, all parties joined in that petition and I note in the brief for the Government filed here at page 9, appears the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.252" offset="3162425">Number 2 here and after Red Lion involves a challenge to a 1965 commission order directing Red Lion Broadcasting Company Inc. licensee of radio station WGCB in Red Lion to afford time to Fred J. Cook.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.695" offset="3236195">So, I take it there can be no question, so far as the Government is concerned, this is a final appealable order.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.985" offset="3269319">Now, Mr. Griswold has made reference to the distinction what he argues between newspapers and radio in the matter of regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.456" offset="3339222">And he suggest that since radio is subject to some regulation, therefore, should be distinguished from the case of newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.542" offset="3391572">We suggest that newspapers are also subject to the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.458" offset="3411216">They're subject to the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.350" offset="3422814">They're subject to the obscenity laws perhaps to a certain degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.691" offset="3440159">But that does not mean that the Government may dictate what maybe publish or what not maybe publish.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.016" offset="3469521">The newspapers enjoy the privilege of law postal rights as do periodicals, but this Court has held in the Hannegan v. Esquire case that the fact that these rates are granted to publications as a privilege, does not authorize the Government to determine what is in the public interest to be mailed and what is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.622" offset="3591879">Now, let me advert briefly in connection with newspapers and news stories to the question put to me yesterday by Mr. Justice White, and which perhaps at the time, I failed to understand fully or misunderstood.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.790" offset="3668574">The question as I recall it was whether or not this Hargis broadcast might have been carried as a bonafide newscast, and therefore have avoided the requirement that free time be given for a reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.403" offset="3743075">I think in the first place is if one examines this broadcast that one must reach a conclusion that under no stretch of the imagination could this be considered a bonafide news broadcast.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.809" offset="3808695">It is a discussion and an attack on Mr. Cook and his book.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.291" offset="3834608">However, and this matter is discussed at some length in the brief filed in Number 717 by Columbia Broadcasting System.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.051" offset="3877658">However, in the first place, under the fairness doctrine or the personal attack doctrine as it stand stood the time of the broadcast, there was no exemption for a personal attack carried in a news broadcast.</text>
