            <label>Mr. Melvyn Zarr</label>
            <text syncTime="18.321" offset="176671">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.441" offset="189106">This case is here in writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Mississippi to review petitioner's criminal conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.322" offset="216691">Petitioner John Davis, a 14-year old Negro boy was convicted of raping an 86-year old white woman for whom he had done yard work and he as sentence to life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.443" offset="261099">This Court granted the petitioner's petition for writ of certiorari and forms a purpose to consider whether the police conduct evidence by this case contriving in the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States, and if so, whether the product of that illegal police conduct, petitioner's fingerprints was properly admitted into evidence at petitioner's trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.213" offset="356185">Briefly, the facts of this, starting December 3, 1965, the police of Meridian, Mississippi took into custody for investigation some 65 to 70 Negro boys.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.657" offset="406026">Now, what they were investigating was a complaint of rape by an 86-year old white woman, who had reported to the police that she had been attacked in her home by a Negro youth on the evening of December 2nd, apparently around seven o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.012" offset="463391">The nature of her description is uncertain but its quality can be inferred from the number of suspects that appeared to cover.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.324" offset="496619">Two partial fingerprints had been found on the outside of a window and a partial palm print that's been found in the inside window sill.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.621" offset="525876">On this basis, they drag had begun.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.493" offset="537370">The petitioner, a 14-year old Negro boy, who had done yard work for the woman was one of the 65 to 70 Negro boys taken into custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.882" offset="570911">The petitioner was taken to the police headquarters on December 3rd, questioned, fingerprinted and released.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.447" offset="593168">The others apparently went to a similar procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.078" offset="607692">Now, it's quite clear from the record that there was no warrant for petitioner's detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.846" offset="626709">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="132.893" offset="634964">The reason is best capsulized in respondent's brief at page 2 in these terms, I'd like to quote it, “that none of the 65 or 70 who are interrogated or picked up were suspects but were only interrogated and printed by the police in an effort to get leads to establish probable cause to arrest the guilty party.”</text>
            <text syncTime="152.715" offset="714271">That was on page 2 of the respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.346" offset="724720">Now, at that December 3rd detention, which was the petitioner's first detention, he was fingerprinted and those sets I shall refer to as the first set.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.606" offset="761814">They were never analyzed nor introduced in evidence and nothing further has been heard of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.774" offset="786474">Now, between December 3rd and 7th, he was taken into custody in the words of the police juvenile Officer Keller about four or five times.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.117" offset="835793">Officer Keller testified that he was picked up in an attempt to get leads, those are his words, and on at least one occasion the petitioner was taken to the hospital and exhibited to the prosecutor for a “gage to go by on size and color.”</text>
            <text syncTime="201.024" offset="907473">However, there was apparently no positive identification even though the record is clear that the petitioner had done some yard work for her recently as two weeks before.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.394" offset="956897">The last detention from which the fingerprints that were introduced in the evidence is second set was green was on -- begin on December 12th, again without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.127" offset="1003917">He was driven to Jackson having been picked up by Officer Keller and Chief Bedingfield, kept overnight to the Jackson jail, given a lie detector test the following day and return to the Meridian jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.152" offset="1055953">On December 14th, this second set was taken and sent off to the FBI laboratory in Washington together with the prints of approximately 23 of Negro boys who were still under suspicion at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.974" offset="1111228">On December 14th, all the record does not show that he was charged with juvenile delinquency for breaking into the woman's home.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.440" offset="1141112">Three days later, his case was certified by the juvenile judge after hearing to the Circuit Court of Lauderdale County, in which Court he was indicted and tried.</text>

            <text syncTime="291.561" offset="1269635">After a hearing this motion was denied, the prosecution's case consisted of the woman's testimony, we just capsulized at page 4 and 5 of our brief to the effect that that he had done yard work for her.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.082" offset="1319685">A description of the attack which is contained and set out in the brief, there was no medical evidence, the second set of fingerprints came in over objection and he was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.</text>

            <text syncTime="480.958" offset="2027186">Few answers previous to that is a testimony of the effect that they in fact did pick him up on the 12th.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.014" offset="2055398">The Mississippi Supreme Court held that on the 12th, he was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.251" offset="2076400">On page 58 of the appendix about 10 lines down the Court says, however on December 12th, the appellant actually was arrested, brought to Jackson and subjected to a lie detector test and of course that's supported by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.772" offset="2138467">Let me back up for one moment and discuss what the Mississippi Supreme Court held, two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.889" offset="2158947">One, that the detention yielding the prints was not an arrest, this probably based on the mistaken assumption that the prints had been taken as a result of the first detention, those who were introduced in evidence were the product of the first detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.916" offset="2219029">And secondly, apparently alternatively, the print should not be excluded because they are authentic.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.561" offset="2245569">Now, respondent argues and I better complete this argument that the -- even though -- even assuming argument that the prints, the second set of prints are to be excludable as a result of a -- an illegal arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.271" offset="2316413">The conviction must yet be affirmed because on and assured retrial, the first set which is presumably lying around some place hasn't been used could be introduced, and therefore to reverse this conviction would be “a useless gesture” quoting from the brief at page 8, to reverse this conviction only to submit the first set of prints to be introduced in evidence at John's retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.446" offset="2417142">This argument of course assumes that the first detention was legal and we maintain quite the contrary and urge the Court to set at rest the constitutional sides of both sets of prints in order to forestall the necessity of further review by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1062.593" offset="4353755">The first is that there is no testimony about police intention after December 3rd.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.911" offset="4379042">The only testimony as to the arrest at December 3rd is that which I quoted from earlier page 6 and 7 of the record by the arresting officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.874" offset="4410911">But there's a sharper answer called for in this case and the fact is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.563" offset="4429615">That the fact that the officer had an investigative intent only in taking him to the station on December 3rd does not dispense with the constitutional requirements of obtaining a warrant or under circumstances where a warrant maybe excused with showing of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.760" offset="4494399">To the contrary and this is our central point in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.441" offset="4509132">To the contrary, the fact that there was an investigative intention only reinforces the legality of the detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.785" offset="4542464">Reinforces the conclusion that there was a violation of constitutional safeguards because you can't get a warrant at least under the law of the land for an investigative arrest and you can't show probable cause or you can't take someone down at the station in order to get probable cause to detain him further.</text>
