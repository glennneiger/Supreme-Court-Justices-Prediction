            <label>Mr. Anthony G. Amsterdam</label>
            <text syncTime="50.830" offset="306657">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.023" offset="331421">The Court is thoroughly familiar with this case, which has been the subject of one prior oral argument here and a briefing -- voluminous briefing by the parties and various amici curiae.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.236" offset="416266">As I see the matter, there are at this time four questions before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.029" offset="459525">The first two are the questions on which this Court granted certiorari in December of 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.863" offset="514800">Number one, whether the Arkansas practice of giving its juries unlimited, unguided, and unreviewable power to sentence persons convicted of rape to live or die, violates the rule of law fundamental to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.786" offset="614484">Two, whether the Arkansas practice of trying simultaneously, in a capital case the issues of guilt and of punishment also violates Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.481" offset="677282">Those are the questions which in the jargon of this case are non-respectively as a standards issue and the single verdict issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.574" offset="717720">The third question is one which arises from this Court's decision in Boulden versus Holman.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.347" offset="752724">In that case as in this one, a state prisoner condemned to death, brought a federal habeas corpus proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.589" offset="805700">In the course of which, he presented no client prior to the appearance of the case in this Court, challenging the selection of the jury that condemned him to die.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.724" offset="858258">Notwithstanding that issue had not been presented in the lower courts and is not included in the application for certiorari here, this Court held that it could notice that the record in his case disclosed a violation of the rule of Witherspoon versus Illinois, in the process by which jurors had been death qualified in the selection of this jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.570" offset="961703">And the Court therefore, vacated and remanded the case to the District Court for further consideration of that Witherspoon client.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.815" offset="1002663">That I will refer to in this case as to Witherspoon issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.293" offset="1020531">The fourth question presented to the Court is not a substantive one.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.333" offset="1044668">It is simply which in how many of the first three questions this Court will address.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.611" offset="1073821">I would like, if I may to begin with that with a question, unless I waste the Court's time.</text>

            <text syncTime="252.832" offset="1114676">The fourth question is not a substantive question, Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.834" offset="1130663">It is which of the first three the Court ought to reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.851" offset="1150725">And rather than launch in to discussion of the first three, I'd like to talk a little about that fourth.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.056" offset="1171623">Now, I recognize in talking about the fourth that this is uniquely a matter for the judgment and for the discretion of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.268" offset="1212479">But I do want to state some facts that I think it is important that the Court know in exercising that discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.253" offset="1256364">To my knowledge there are somewhat more than 67 death cases pending on petitions for writs of certiorari in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.492" offset="1309341">In the past weeks, I have caused examination to be made of all of the ones that we could identify, and we have examined 67.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.818" offset="1354689">There are 45 cases, out of that 67 coming from 18 states, which present either the standards issue or the split verdict issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.459" offset="1405158">To be specific, the standards issue is presented in 43 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.180" offset="1428041">The split verdict issue is presented in 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.358" offset="1452805">Again, to the best of my current information, there are presently on the death rows in this country, approximately 510 condemned men.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.643" offset="1509961">The decision of this Court in the Maxwell case on the standards issue, would potentially affect all but five of those 510 condemned men, that is better than 500.</text>

            <text syncTime="390.024" offset="1663457">There's only one active mandatory capital crime in the sense that people are being tried for, there's no anybody on death row for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.301" offset="1688534">The five people to whom I refer are five California convicts who are presently on death row, because of conviction of a crime, which carries a mandatory death penalty (Voice Overlap).</text>

            <text syncTime="416.086" offset="1767737">The split verdict issue would potentially effect to the best of my calculation and this is a very rough one, 380 to 390 of the 510 men are on death row.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.673" offset="1834088">And this Mr. Justice Stewart is of course because several of the states, including those with the major death row populations, such as California have split verdict, so that the number is very significantly reduced.</text>

            <text syncTime="503.860" offset="2118823">It was -- I think that the split verdict for capital trials wasn't involved in Spencer there.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.764" offset="2154454">Texas, since Spencer has revised both the procedure for recidivist trials and the procedure for sentencing in capital cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.106" offset="2203773">The one other area that I think I want to bring to the Court's attention, in connection with the question of what issues it's had reached comes from experience of about five years in dealing with these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.349" offset="2272737">Prior to the time when this Court granted review in Maxwell versus Bishop, the job of getting stays of execution for condemned men was an incredibly difficult, perilous job.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.796" offset="2342536">On occasions, courts would stay executions.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.638" offset="2361971">Occasionally, we would have to come to the justices of this Court to get stays of execution a day, two days before the execution dates were set, as we did in this Maxwell case.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.415" offset="2413066">Since the grant of review in Maxwell versus Bishop, it has been far easier to get courts to be willing to stay an execution, until this Court finally disposed of the issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.752" offset="2486418">And the question of getting stays of execution is a vital one, literally of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.956" offset="2511182">But also a troublesome one, because many of the men on death row are still not represented, and those of us who are trying to represent them very often don't learn, until the last minute that an execution date has been set.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.844" offset="2570742">Since Maxwell v. Bishop was brought before this Court, the governors of several states, Arkansas, Massachusetts, Washington, have agreed to hold up all executions in the state, pending decisions of these issues by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.759" offset="2630405">However, if this Court should dispose of the Maxwell versus Bishop case on a ground, which does not resolve the standards and the single verdict issues, and if it does not simultaneously grant review on those issues in one of the other pending cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.433" offset="2713057">The problem of getting stays of execution will not be even what it was before the grant of review in Maxwell versus Bishop, it will be far worst.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.247" offset="2748374">The reason for that is this, that in recent years, and for the most part, since the grant of review in Maxwell versus Bishop, the highest courts of 17 states, including the states with the eight largest death row populations in this country have rejected the standards client.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.012" offset="2843460">There are on the death rows of those states about 380 condemned men.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.294" offset="2876583">And the claim has also have been rejected by the federal Courts of Appeals of the Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits with a result that federal stays of execution in habeas corpus would also not likely be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.270" offset="2928410">The standards issue, pardon me, split verdict issue has at the same time been rejected by the highest courts of 11 states, having about 220 men on their death rows.</text>

            <text syncTime="741.955" offset="3071143">What this means in effect is that if ever there were an issue of grave national importance, it is the issue presented in the questions, on which this Court granted review in this case, in December of 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.858" offset="3138853">It may well be that the constitutional contentions raised by Maxwell and by these other condemned men are not going to be sustained, but I would only ask that this Court pass upon those issues in this case or in another before the executions, which will surely follow.</text>

            <text syncTime="867.642" offset="3573948">Mr. Chief Justice, I am asserting only that the Constitution compels the procedure of providing standards of some sort to guide a jury in its discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.934" offset="3635075">And that it requires some form of trial, not necessarily the single verdict trial in fact been used in California or Pennsylvania, that's a matter of the state to decide what procedure it wants to use.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.464" offset="3677184">But that the Constitution requires some form of trial, which does not whipsaw a capital defendant between his privileges against self-incrimination, and his right to provide the jury with adequate information to make an informed sentencing choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.947" offset="3735176">I want to make that very plain because I think in the last oral argument, I failed to do so, and I'm not at all clear we've done so in the briefs.</text>

            <text syncTime="939.406" offset="3860982">The kind of due process that's involved in this case is the most fundamental, basic, traditional, classical concept of due process, simply, due process as the law of the land, in the meaning of Magna Carta, a requirement of legality, a requirement of lawfulness.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.576" offset="3945723">And Mr. Chief Justice, it is our assertion not that the procedures that we are urging are better procedures or more humane procedures, or even more beneficial procedures to the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1405.683" offset="5726124">Some who will live, and some who will die without standards for that determination, without guidelines, and it does violate the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1419.040" offset="5779519">I do -- I would not drag, but I would urge that in this case, the case of rape, you have a somewhat easier case than you do a first-degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.507" offset="5813373">And the reason for that is that the amount of discretion that may be tolerable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1437.670" offset="5854020">The amount of raw naked power to take a life or save a life that can be given may depend on the range of cases, within which the jury can exercise it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1449.536" offset="5901563">Is a very broad range of offenses, it ranges from anything from a fellow and a girl, who had been going together, getting into a situation, and he going too far over resistance to a brutal beating of a child with permanent physical injury or torture rape or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.211" offset="5980244">It's just a tremendous range of factual situations encompassed within the notion of rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.912" offset="6006993">So that the idea that the offensive rape sets any limitation or gives guidance to the jury, is just totally (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.601" offset="6041788">There are within the total gambit of cases in which convictions of rape come down, an infinite variety of factual circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.988" offset="6075329">Now, the theory seems to be that the jury somehow, that 12 men brought off the street, who have never sentenced anybody else, and will never sentence anybody else again, who have no way of making the judgment that they pass in this case consistent with the judgment that's been passed or will be passed on any other human being convicted of this crime, that they somehow will look at all the facts of this case come out with circumstances that warrant the death penalty and impose it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1589.944" offset="6463195">It is a very different question from saying to the jury if you find that the plaintiff should win this case, you should find for the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.877" offset="6494856">At least, telling them that the defendant must exercise care, which a reasonable man would exercise, let's them go back and talk about something, one juror can say to another juror, “Well, what is the amount of care that in this particular automobile case, a reasonable man would have exercised?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.094" offset="6559744">It is more than the amount of care that has to be exercise with regard to a trespasser and less than the amount of care that has to be exercised with regard to -- for example somebody to whom you owe a special duty of care.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.948" offset="6615124">The whole up is based on making those kinds of distinctions, and the fact that not anyone of them will bring you out, computer-like to a conclusion, doesn't mean that there aren't standards involved there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1670.015" offset="6783457">If you did a study of cases in which plaintiffs had sued defendants and juries had come up with a verdict, in negligence cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1708.446" offset="6937161">Three factors emerged that characterized the cases, in which persons get the death penalty: race, the commission of contemporaneous offense, a prior record of imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.911" offset="6987003">A prior record of imprisonment may have nothing to do with the jury's determination rationally of it, because a jury ordinarily doesn't know about a prior record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.622" offset="7025873">So that I think that both in legal theory and in fact, this is a very different business from the juries going out and in a negligence case in saying, “Well, did that defendant have a duty of care?</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.317" offset="7092642">What was that duty of care?</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.782" offset="7098493">Did he act the way a reasonable man would act?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.588" offset="7105703">In Arkansas, none of those questions need to be asked, and in performance the juries do very different things.</text>

            <text syncTime="2508.716" offset="10138206">Mr. Justice Harlan, I believe that the Court will not be setting its foot on a primrose path, if it demands that the states set some standards for the penalty determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.246" offset="10204348">I believe that statutes are draftable, which will provide adequate constitutional standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.578" offset="10237680">I say that in view of two major considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.588" offset="10261713">First, I think we already had some models.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.960" offset="10271222">I think that the ALI Model Penal Code, model for a capital punishment statute, although I might not agree with all of its details is a workable model.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.593" offset="10325765">Secondly, again I'd like to advert, if I may to the history of the Court's experience in dealing with ordinances, it regulates parades in that certain time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.912" offset="10371009">I think it might have been arguable, and it might have looked very plausible before this Court's decision in 1938 in Lovell and Griffin, to say that you could not draft an ordinance, that would take account of all of the imponderables that had to do with the question of whether or not you would let a parade go down the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.312" offset="10444570">You have to worry about traffic, you have to worry about crowd control, you have to worry about the availability of police, you have to worry about emergency vehicles, you have to worry about a thousand contingencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.885" offset="10486888">Nevertheless, it was not three years after this Court's decision in Lovell versus Griffin, requiring standards, that this Court sustained a statute as a having standards in Cox in New Hampshire in 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.027" offset="10539447">And the fact that there's been 30 years of experience in which this Court has had to knock down various ordinances for lack of standards it's not because it was impossible to draft standards, but simply because there was a willful refusal to comply with what this Court demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.219" offset="10604231">And I say willful advisably, because the considerations that kept open-handed discretion in the hands of police chiefs to regulate parades is very much the same thing that is being given to juries in capital punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.361" offset="10656789">There is simply feeling that if you really brought up to the surface and articulated the considerations that the legislature was attending to effect juries, like race, they wouldn't stand the light of debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.425" offset="10709034">Now, I think that it is possible to draft a statute, which will withstand the constitutional scrutiny of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.313" offset="10736619">And I think that insistence by this Court that the legislature address itself, tearing its undoubtedly greater wisdom, and it's undoubtedly more appropriate penological judgment to that question will advance, the cause of the drafting of adequate statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.130" offset="10807881">I think that if this Court hadn't decided in Lovell and Griffin that it was necessary, the legislatures never would have caught.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.176" offset="10832123">Now, that they've tired, they've succeeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.213" offset="10840273">I think that if this Court insist that the rule of law requires the drafting of standards in this area, that it will be possible to do, and I think that the Model Penal Code, although I have some questions about details of it, and although it's applicable to murder and not to rape is a fair example of what legislatures can do if they try.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.917" offset="10915088">Now, there is -- though I think a second answer to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.571" offset="10941628">If I were to conclude that it was impossible to draft a statute which would impose the rule of law on a decision, whether or not men should live or die.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.982" offset="10999306">So, that it was impossible to reconcile the basic requirement of lawfulness in proceedings with the death penalty, I have no doubt which of the two institutions, the constitution say should prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.049" offset="11063568">If the cause of a system of capital punishment is lawlessness in its administration, the Constitution forbids that kind of lawlessness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.970" offset="11103274">And that causes me to revert to what I think is essentially wrong with Arkansas' procedure for determining who lives and who dies in a capital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.550" offset="11153533">That is a decision, as I have said which is not the dispensation of mercy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.271" offset="11176417">On this record it appears that less than a quarter of the total number of persons convicted of a crime of rape are sentenced to death, and that appears to be a very high figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.378" offset="11232841">The general statistics that are available, and we put them in the appendix to our brief and they have a great deal of trouble analytically, but nevertheless one can draw some implications from it, the general statistics that are available appear to show that not more than 10% of people convicted of capital rape were in fact sentenced to die, and that for murder, it may be up in a neighborhood of 20%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.790" offset="11326568">Now, the process by which jurors take, out of all the persons convicted of a like harm, one-tenth or one-fifth of those persons and subject them to the most extreme penalty known to our law has got to be under the Constitution I submit, a rational, regular, and lawful process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.125" offset="11415907">I do not think that this Court for one moment would sustain a state enactment of a statute that said that out of every five persons convicted of murder, and out of every ten persons convicted of rape, they shall meet in the state penitentiary and draw straws to see who will die.</text>

            <text syncTime="3195.557" offset="12885556">Mr. Justice White, I -- my own personal position again would be that standards are required of juries and of judges in non-capital sentencing under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.701" offset="12926203">But I think that since Skinner and Oklahoma, it has been cleared that this Court has drawn a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.458" offset="12953161">In Skinner, the Court said that you couldn't sterilize thieves, unless you sterilize embezzlers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.747" offset="12974373">Now, nobody has ever argued that you can't punish theft by 15 years of imprisonment, and punish embezzlement by 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.572" offset="13001644">Those kinds of penological judgments are simply of a different order of magnitude in the choice of life or death, and the Court has required different degrees of regularity in the procedures, and even handedness in the procedures from posing the penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.156" offset="13064025">A second consideration and I think is vitally important is this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.751" offset="13082415">When you are talking about non-capital sentences, you have a consideration that just doesn't enter into the equation, when you talk about capital sentences, that the rehabilitative aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.153" offset="13131943">Now, I am not ascertain, I'll make this very clear that the Constitution requires that states take rehabilitation into account, in their sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.987" offset="13171336">But I am asserting that inevitably states do take rehabilitation into account, for a simple fact that if you send a fellow away to prison, he's going to come out, and everybody wants to come out, better of it than worse from the point of view of society.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.530" offset="13225462">Now, we simply do not have the calibers of this stage of a science to reduce the rehabilitation factor to categorical judgments, which permit themselves to be articulated in standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.054" offset="13291604">When you make the decision, however, to sentence a man to die, instead of to live, you're making a decision, to take him out of the rehabilitative regime entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.437" offset="13329115">And that kind of standard it seem to me, can't barrel the benefits of what we don't know about rehabilitation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3469.602" offset="13981759">It would to me be an anomaly of a highest degree if this Court were willing to exact the more demanding requirement of Pearce, not simply that there'll be standards for the decision, but the reasons for the application of those standards be articulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.072" offset="14047692">Where the risk is -- and although I think there is a risk, I think it's not a terribly great one, that a judge would be vindictive, and not to require standards, where the danger is that a person will be sentenced to death on account of his race, where in Arkansas specifically and in this country generally, everybody who has examined this question has concluded, that in fact jurors are racially discriminating in the imposition of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.048" offset="14155525">But danger of that, of a flagrant and otherwise unprevalent violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution, should require this Court to assure that the procedure comes up to visibility, in a way in which that racial factor will not have the effect that we know it now has in capital sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3714.198" offset="14960201">Now, again with regard with the split verdict issue, I want to make very clear that we are not relying on some general notion of fairness, which is to be spelled out in due process clause of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.388" offset="15024880">We are relying in this case on what I think is a palpable inconsistency between the federally protected privilege against self-incrimination of the defendant, and is equally protected set of federal constitutional rights in assuring a rational sentencing decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3751.877" offset="15110875">Those latter rights include: right to a hearing on a question which is as considerable as the question of life or death, and the opportunity to present defensive evidence addressed to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.412" offset="15177017">Now in a single verdict trial, a defendant who, like William Maxwell, exercises his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination allows the jury to decide whether he shall live or die, without presenting a slightest bit of evidence relevant to the choice of life or death, except the evidence that comes in on the guilt issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.837" offset="15294673">Now again, I am not asserting and it is not the basis of our constitutional submission that a state is constitutionally precluded from permitting the decision as to life or death to be made on the facts of the offence if the state does that, but the State of Arkansas does not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3815.653" offset="15365935">It is very clear that the State of Arkansas permits the decision as to life or death to be made on a broad basis, including background information, and any other material that may in the unfetter discretion of the jury affects it's choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.315" offset="15424658">Now this means that a defendant is paid a very high price for giving up the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3839.973" offset="15463215">If he chooses either to plead guilty and limit the trial to the issue of punishment or to take the stand, raise all of the question of background, talk to the jurors, show them that he is a human being, show them that he has a voice, explain what led him to what he did, and asked for mercy, in light of those considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3859.975" offset="15543254">He stands a far better chance that the decision will be made on a full and rational basis, than if he is simply exercises his privilege and does not testify.</text>

            <text syncTime="4090.713" offset="16466213">However, that again is not this case, although I would have my constitutional doubts about that, the Court doesn't even have to reach that question again as in the question of standards.</text>

            <text syncTime="4187.727" offset="16854288">As the Eight Circuit Court of Appeals in this case said when it was before them that guilt or innocence is not an issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4199.621" offset="16901831">Our State's Supreme Court has held in this case that the evidence made an overwhelming fashion, all of the requirements for conviction, for the offensive rape, as it was defined in 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="4212.677" offset="16954075">Of course, our rape statute has been changed, since that time in 1967, it was changed for three degrees of rape, and the penalty was changed for first degree rape, which this would have fit into, if it has occurred after 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="4229.499" offset="17021367">The new penalty for rape, first-degree rape is 30 years to life or death, in the discretion of the jury, which this offense would fall into.</text>
            <text syncTime="4242.681" offset="17074134">The facts of this particular case do not appear to be an issue that as the Eight Circuit characterized it, that the circumstances of this crime, as usual are sorted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4259.638" offset="17141948">A few of the background facts is that on November 3, 1961, in the early morning of -- in that early morning, a 35-year-old white woman was brutally beaten and raped by the petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4276.794" offset="17210598">And her 90-year-old helpless father was also beaten.</text>
            <text syncTime="4280.872" offset="17226898">She was then dragged to the vacant lot down the street and attacked.</text>
            <text syncTime="4286.868" offset="17250826">We feel that guilt or innocence is not an issue in this case as are other issues, which Mr. Amsterdam has mentioned in his brief and his oral argument here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4299.329" offset="17300668">In Arkansas, there are five offenses, which are punishable by death.</text>
            <text syncTime="4306.034" offset="17327522">One is kidnapping, also rape, murder in the first degree, a treason, and burning of prisons by convicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4317.087" offset="17371721">As originally enacted in Arkansas, these statutes provided automatically for the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4324.634" offset="17401919">In 1915, the Arkansas legislature, as Mr. Amsterdam has mentioned, enacted Arkansas Statute 43-2153, which gave the jury the discretion of imposing a sentence of life imprisonment, instead of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="4343.952" offset="17479137">Now, petitioner and some of briefs that were filed on his behalf about others contend that the death penalty should be voided and abolished as cruel and unusual punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4355.336" offset="17524694">While the State of Arkansas recognizes that there may be some movement in that direction, that issue is not before this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="7454.086" offset="29919692">And it's not uncommon to have a whole variety of penalties handed out to a number of people, who have committed precisely the same crime, because you look to their background, you look to their role in the crime, you look to the nature of what each of those persons did.</text>
            <text syncTime="7470.992" offset="29987297">And the Court has found nothing of constitutional dimensions in any way to bar this kind of procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="7479.617" offset="30021883">Now, we think that the leaving to the jury, the opportunity to extend mercy to a man who is convicted of a crime, potentially involved in a capital punishment, is simply an application of fitting the punishment to the offender and not to the crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="7511.370" offset="30148838">And the capital sentencing is very typical of other sentencing in that respect in fitting the punishment to the offender.</text>

            <text syncTime="7602.916" offset="30515075">And I'm not talking about the single verdict, but in terms of standards, if what we're doing now is wrong, what is it that we should do?</text>
            <text syncTime="7608.958" offset="30539212">Now, this is something that was covered in Witherspoon very carefully.</text>
            <text syncTime="7613.043" offset="30555512">At least in noting what was not forbidden in Witherspoon, and giving the states guidelines as to what to do with these cases when they came back.</text>
            <text syncTime="7621.896" offset="30590934">Now in listening to the argument today and in the reading the briefs, I haven't seen anything that's specifically points to the what the states could do to meet the standards that the petitioners submit have to be established.</text>
            <text syncTime="7636.815" offset="30650598">They say if you look at the Model Penal Code, you'll find one you've limited defendants, there are things they can't urge.</text>
            <text syncTime="7643.270" offset="30676407">And I don't think the people want that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7647.902" offset="30695006">Even under the Model Penal Code you get down to formulations like this, it's easy to talk about standards, but what is the final formulation to a jury under the Model Penal Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="7656.663" offset="30730010">Well, if found an aggravating circumstance, which could be -- for example he killed more than one person or he committed a felony in certain kinds and in connecting with the killing.</text>
            <text syncTime="7667.166" offset="30772015">If you find an aggravating circumstance, you may return a death a sentence, you don't have to, you may, but then you have to determine whether the mitigating circumstances are not sufficiently substantial to call for leniency.</text>
            <text syncTime="7684.358" offset="30840769">Now, what's the jury's told, that's the instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="7688.006" offset="30855398">And that would be my guess that a jury would go back and talk about these mitigating circumstances, and come back with a judge, and say well you told us what we could consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="7697.824" offset="30894686">But how do we weigh each of these items, and how we determine when a particular circumstance is sufficiently substantial to call for leniency.</text>
            <text syncTime="7708.375" offset="30936900">And I think the judge would have to say, “Well, you use your discretion, that's what then your sound discretion.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7715.194" offset="30964172">So, where are you except that you have limited the defendant, and you set up a kind of an artificial and a structure that meets what the petitioners think all statutes should consist of and you ignored the experience of all the states that have the death sentence, and the United States Government, and for what end.</text>
            <text syncTime="7737.746" offset="31054346">I think as the end would be a jury, still left with having to come to that fundamental decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="7745.707" offset="31086216">Is this man going to die or is he going to live, and bare in mind that it's a man who has committed a capital offense and has been found guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="7753.062" offset="31115577">It's not someone off the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="7755.447" offset="31125191">And one thing that has been emphasized in California, and there are number of cases that repeat this theme, and it runs through all of the death penalty cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="7764.280" offset="31160508">We have many, many cases that deal only with penalty procedures, many appellate decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="7769.669" offset="31182033">And we've had countless retrials, solely on penalty, but a theme that runs through all of those decisions is this, you've got to convince the juror that it's his individual responsibility for that verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="7782.424" offset="31233024">When he goes out of that courtroom or he comes back with a verdict, it's his decision that this man should die.</text>
            <text syncTime="7788.621" offset="31257893">He cannot leave the decision in someone else's hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="7792.465" offset="31273253">You can't tell him the governor may grant clemency, because he's not supposed to think about such things.</text>
            <text syncTime="7797.209" offset="31292165">If he mentions anything about parole, he's not supposed to worry about the parole board making a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="7802.062" offset="31311600">It has to be his individual decision, and anything that has impeached that individual decision has been held bad in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="7811.868" offset="31350888">Now, I think this is the -- the best way to administer this system if the death penalty is to continue and its validity asset is not an issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7826.452" offset="31409194">If it's going to continue, and if you're going to conclude that not every member, not every person who commits murder one, should be executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="7834.418" offset="31441063">Then, I think that the -- what we do is the fairest and the most rational, if I may use that word, way of concluding who should be executed that I have heard about.</text>
            <text syncTime="7846.863" offset="31490800">And I think it's far preferable to the Model Penal Code, and I certainly think the legislature would reject notions of mandatory death sentences, in light of our whole experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="7858.933" offset="31539075">Emphasizing this individual responsibility, I think gives the defendant the fair shake, and emphasizing to the jury that they have to consider the evidence, that they have to consider things that are produced in court, excludes, I think the possibility of any of the arbitrariness that's been mentioned here, earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="7879.325" offset="31620681">I have no doubt that a jury in California can't point to any decision, but I have no doubt that if a defendant thought that racial prejudice, status, class, position, or anything of that sort might possibly influence any single juror that he could ask the judge to please instruct them to get such things out of their minds.</text>
            <text syncTime="7901.591" offset="31709706">I don't think those -- it's very unlikely that that would enter the minds of the jurors, but if there were any possibility, that could certainly be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="7911.836" offset="31750666">They wouldn't have anymore of a standard, but should be telling you, you can't rely on these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="7916.105" offset="31767803">That could be done, whether it could be done in Arkansas, I don't know, probably --</text>

            <label>Mr. Anthony G. Amsterdam</label>
            <text syncTime="8315.044" offset="33363571">I would like to speak to questions of Arkansas law that came up and not reopen the constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="8325.778" offset="33406516">First, with regard to Mr. Justice Brennan's question, we have dealt at pages 66 through 69 of our brief with the kind of evidence that comes in from impeachment and that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="8337.777" offset="33454477">It is indeed very broad, for example the right case we mentioned here, in which the rape defendant was asked whether several persons had not told him to quit hanging around their places of business, because he made indecent proposals to women?</text>
            <text syncTime="8350.642" offset="33505991">That's the kind of thing. And there is one limitation though, I don't want to say there are no limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="8355.668" offset="33526053">Apparently, if in a negative act, the bad act, an evil act is not reduced to conviction and it's too remote, it may not be shown, but what that means we don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="8370.802" offset="33586552">A 20-year old liquor, misdemeanor liquor violations have come in to impeach.</text>
            <text syncTime="8375.317" offset="33604629">So really even that, it's just no limitations and the answer is, that in effect, it is the whole defendant's life on rebuttal for impeachment if he takes the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="8386.236" offset="33648306">Now, with regard to --Mr. Justice Harlan asked at one point, whether the jury had to be unanimous in Arkansas, the answer that Mr. Langston gave, as I understand it was that they did, but I want to make clear that it has to be unanimous either way, not the kind of situation you have in California, where one juror can prevent a death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="8405.536" offset="33725524">If the jury hangs, the jury is discharged and they try the case again.</text>
            <text syncTime="8410.517" offset="33745481">And that also, I want to make clear, it tends to point the way the construction of this statute that Mr. Langston has twice mentioned, this 43-2310, which he said gives trial courts the power to set aside verdict on the ground that they don't -- they find outrageous which some such thing a jury death verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="8429.283" offset="33820505">To start with, I don't think the statute allows that, it predates the 1915 statute, which crease discretion in capital cases, and would seem to apply in non-capital cases only.</text>
            <text syncTime="8440.258" offset="33864391">There is in other statute that the Court might want to look at, which is 43-2306, which provides that when a jury find the verdict of guilt and failed to agree on the punishment or do not declare such punishment, and the judge renders judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="8455.061" offset="33923636">Now, Mr. Langston admits that doesn't apply in capital cases, plays in the same terms as the power to reduce the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="8461.217" offset="33948191">And the reason it does is for the same reason that 43-2310 does it.</text>
            <text syncTime="8465.148" offset="33963969">It was inactive before the 1915 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="8467.392" offset="33972955">It was no designed to deal with capital cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="8470.135" offset="33983927">Now, I'm not asserting here as a matter of Arkansas law, I can tell you that that's statute doesn't give judges the power to set aside verdicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="8477.287" offset="34012557">It doesn't look that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="8479.357" offset="34020812">And I have asked questions of Arkansas lawyers, as well as to whether they know of any case in which a judge has done so, and the answer has been no.</text>
            <text syncTime="8486.665" offset="34050069">When Mr. Langston was asked the question last time up in oral argument, he may say he didn't think they ever done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="8491.907" offset="34070967">Now, I'm not denying that they may have done so, I have never heard of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="8495.006" offset="34083401">I know in California they have that power and I know it for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="8498.561" offset="34097612">One, that California Supreme Court has said so in an opinion, and two, Judge Phillips, for example in Oakland has done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="8504.982" offset="34123316">And I can name the judge, and I can name the time, and I know the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="8508.273" offset="34136482">In Arkansas that has never happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="8510.582" offset="34145677">And that is one of the several things that differentiates Arkansas from California.</text>
            <text syncTime="8517.105" offset="34171800">Most of the things we have heard from Mr. Harris seem to me to demonstrate of anything, the entire lawlessness of the procedure in Arkansas.</text>
