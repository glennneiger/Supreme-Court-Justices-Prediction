            <label>Mr. William M.acker, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="62.085" offset="351692">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.097" offset="375724">The petitioners, Glover and others, were the plaintiffs below.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.456" offset="405191">This case comes here purely and simply on the pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.875" offset="426924">The plaintiffs were 14 railroad carmen helpers.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.432" offset="453151">Their complaint in the District Court charged a cooperative scheme by the St. Louis-San Francisco Railroad Co. and their brotherhood, the Brotherhood of Railway Carmen, to perpetuate a long-existing racial discrimination in the area of seniority by the device of using what they call apprentices to do the traditional work of carmen helpers.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.099" offset="583764">They use quite apprentices, so that the Negro carmen helpers will continue not to get promoted to the classification of carmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.985" offset="639352">This device has caused a bottleneck in seniority which affects not only the Negro carmen helpers, but the White carmen helpers unfortunate enough to be behind them on the seniority roster.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.653" offset="697971">The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that the plaintiffs had not alleged in exhaustion, one, of their remedy before the National Railroad Adjustment Board, two, their remedy within the Union itself and, three, their remedy provided by the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.338" offset="800684">There were no specific allegations in the complaint as to the character of these two supposed contractual remedies or even if they existed, but the District Court nevertheless concluded that they both were, as he said, "available" and must be employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.710" offset="898173">The Fifth Circuit affirmed and this Court has granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.830" offset="926699">Let me say that some people don't like the concept of seniority as the criterion for job assignment and promotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.734" offset="966301">I don't think it is for me to be for or against this concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.093" offset="987721">It's just a fact of labor life, and racial discrimination in the application of this concept is where discrimination hurts the most.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.865" offset="1042787">It hurts the pocketbook, and I submit that to eliminate invidious discrimination in this area can lead ultimately to its elimination in other sectors of our national life.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.584" offset="1113736">While I was on the airplane coming up from Birmingham with the plane jumping up and down, I grab a hold on something to get my mind off of that and I picked up the "Look" magazine for this week.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.542" offset="1165563">I was surprised to see the first article in that magazine entitled "What Unions do to Blacks." As I turned through the pages, I was even more surprised to see a picture of one of my clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.876" offset="1238915">I mention this for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.927" offset="1247065">One, I don't want the Court to think that I had anything to do with the preparation of or publication of this article just before this case is set for oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.759" offset="1290428">It was absolutely news to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.382" offset="1304952">Two, despite that disclaimer, there are a couple of things in this article that I'd like to read and that I think have particular bearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.498" offset="1345390">The sub-headline says "for nearly a century, most Unions have forced Negros into Jim Crow logos, giving them dirty jobs or refuse to admit them at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.480" offset="1389275">New laws and repeated Union promises are not stopping prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.091" offset="1407770">And then, down in the body, it says this.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.181" offset="1416129">"Union controlled apprenticeship programs," fits this one like a glove, "admit far less than token numbers of Negros," and then "Unions are doggedly battling civil rights complaints that are before the Courts and government agencies."</text>
            <text syncTime="348.235" offset="1496273">Despite landmark Court decisions in 1967 and 1968, the Union seemed determined to fight a rear guard holding action reminiscent of the one thought by southern school districts after the Supreme Court's 1954 school desegregation decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.978" offset="1579238">Now, if we may, let's see where the lower Court's reasoning in this case would lead these plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.810" offset="1622601">First, what about the internal Union complaint procedures?</text>
            <text syncTime="386.218" offset="1648201">The Trial Court said that such procedures were there so, for the sake of argument, we'll have to assume, I suppose, that they are there.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.098" offset="1695744">It would be unbecoming of me to go outside the record to describe these intra-Union procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.032" offset="1727509">There are no allegations as to what they are, no allegations by the plaintiffs, no allegations by the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.604" offset="1757811">However, I think in -- it's not unsophisticated, but this Court, just as I know it, to know that the plaintiffs could not get damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.724" offset="1826252">Damages, that's one of the things they are suing for, damages, money damages for past discrimination from the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.964" offset="1855195">If they go through the Union constitution, such as it is, are they going to be able to ask for and get what they're asking here, damages?</text>
            <text syncTime="447.329" offset="1892707">It is just as easy, I think, to know that they cannot get promotion from the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.928" offset="1915068">The Union doesn't promote people.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.180" offset="1932100">The best that they theoretically could hope for with the Union alone would be an admission by the Union by some top decision making body or policy making body of the Union that the Union was wrong in failing to take their grievance to the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.072" offset="2015692">It's all they could hope for with the Union procedures.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="501.302" offset="2108583">Well, then why couldn't they get damages from the Union if you're right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_macker_jr" startTime="505.015" stopTime="806.316">
            <label>Mr. William M.acker, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="505.015" offset="2123421">I don't think they could get damages from the Union in -- within the Union constitutional procedures but, then, we're discussing constitutional procedures within the Union, assuming they exist, that are not pledged.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.524" offset="2173471">And if the Court does not have any way to know what those procedures are, I will say that the Union constitution does not provide a method for the Union to compensate someone monetarily for some wrongdoing, and that's all I'm discussing at this point, is what they could get there theoretically.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.919" offset="2267094">Now, what could they expect from the company if they process the grievance without the Union's blessing and in the face of its active opposition?</text>
            <text syncTime="551.632" offset="2309935">The actual grievance machinery here again is not spelled out in the complaint but, in these matters, it's easy to know that they would get nowhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.231" offset="2360299">If they sought redress with the company in the face and in the teeth of their own Union's opposition and collusion then, according to the Fifth Circuit, the Court from which this case comes in Haynes against U.S. Pipe, a case that was cited in -- by the District Court in its memorandum opinion, then there would be no judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.826" offset="2462699">The Fifth Circuit is not saying that you exhaust your administrative remedies within the company and, if you're not satisfied, you then go to Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.150" offset="2495927">They're saying, in Haynes, you exhaust your administrative remedy within the company even if the last and ultimate method that the employee employs is to get his Union to strike, and if that doesn't work, he's finished.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.833" offset="2578683">This is what the Fifth Circuit says.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.971" offset="2591222">"At this point, the decision denying him relief was final under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement or the processes of the now available to him for contesting or avoiding that final decision."</text>
            <text syncTime="634.158" offset="2640018">We're talking now about intra-company procedures and, in that case, the Fifth Circuit said "appellant does not contend that the Union did not faithfully represent him."</text>
            <text syncTime="643.492" offset="2677321">That may be a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.252" offset="2684426">He does not charge fraud on the part of either the company or the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.803" offset="2702608">This is a run of the Mine case where the grievance procedure was followed and the adverse decision against appellant became final.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.054" offset="2731551">Being dissatisfied, he sought to start anew in the face of the Bar in the final decision under the grievance procedure, which means the Fifth Circuit in Haynes would say that unless the plaintiffs here would bite off the tremendous burden after having exhausted this machinery if the District Court and the Fifth Circuit say we must exhaust, unless we want to bite off the burden and take on the burden of proving fraud on the part of the Union in the company, fraud, then we have no judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.122" offset="2867911">We've reached the end of the road by referring this matter to the grievance machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.921" offset="2899048">Now, what could the plaintiffs reasonably expect from the National Railroad Adjustment Board?</text>
            <text syncTime="705.927" offset="2927052">The 1966 revisions of the Railway Labor Act came too late for Mr. Glover and his friends.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.977" offset="2971251">They filed this case in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.863" offset="2986820">The carmen in their brief admit to an average of three years for processing a claim before the NRAB Second Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.258" offset="3024436">The railroad admits to less.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.600" offset="3041782">This Court in Walker against the Southern Railway was not only impressed by the unreasonable delays before the NRAB, before the 1966 revisions which would make the NRAB procedures in 1965 applicable here just as in Walker, but by the absence of any judicial review in an event of a decision adverse to the individual employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.896" offset="3150973">This Court said that Congress also found if an employee receives an award in his favor from the Board, the Railroad affected may obtain judicial relief of that award by declining to comply with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.621" offset="3201860">If, however, an employee fails to receive an award in his favor, there is no means by which judicial review may be obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.896" offset="3238954">Now, that point is argued in our brief at some length, but this particular case was not referred to the most recent at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.348" offset="3280750">We think that, as constituted, as created, as conceived by the Congress, the NRAB is not able, not designed for handling this kind of grievance.</text>

            <text syncTime="806.316" offset="3328606">But, I take it, that there's no question that the individual employee, as distinguished from the Union, may oper -- may energize the grievance procedure in the railroad business.</text>

            <text syncTime="947.676" offset="3894105">Well, my own personal view, Mr. Justice Brennan, would be that this particular tribunal as constituted with an absence of judicial review from an adverse decision to an employee, if the Congress required it and attempted to overrule by legislation the Steel and Tungsten cases, as I interpret them, then I think the Congress would've enacted unconstitutional legislation, that's my personal view.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.183" offset="4028061">I obviously do not have time to comment on all of the important cases bearing on the question of exhaustion of remedies, but I'd like to discuss these.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.273" offset="4068498">Republic Steel against Maddox, Vaca against Sipes, NR -- NLRB against Shipbuilding Local 22, and Holton against Scrant, all decided by this Court, and Rothlein against Armour &amp; Co., decided very recently by the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.668" offset="4146030">If I had any time, I'd like to briefly mention Conley against Gibson and Walker against Southern Railway and in Republic Steel against Maddox.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.887" offset="4202872">The Maddox case, first off, didn't involve a claim against a man's Union as well as the company for which he worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.457" offset="4253236">The majority of the Court in that case considered it a run of the mill discharge case and simply held that Mr. Maddox should've employed the grievance machinery which, there, was clearly provided by the collective bargaining agreement under the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.176" offset="4324080">If the collective bargaining agreement was there for the Court to examine and to determine that it was available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.877" offset="4350830">In this case, it's not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.338" offset="4356681">It hasn't been pled by us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.434" offset="4365145">It hasn't been pled by the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.939" offset="4375176">And, the Court said as a general rule in cases to which federal law applies, federal labor policy requires that individual employees wishing to assert contract grievances must attempt, with the Court's emphasis, "use of a contract grievance procedure agreed upon by employer and Union as the mode of redress."</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.248" offset="4472351">It continued "if the Union refuses to press or only perfunctorily presses the individual's claim, differences may arise as to the forms of redress then available, but unless the contract provides otherwise, there can be no doubt that the employee must afford the Union the opportunity to act on his behalf."</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.090" offset="4575692">Now, we amended this complaint after Judge Linn threw as out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.757" offset="4598366">I don't know that we added anything, really, to the complaint by our amendment because, in the original complaint, it clearly appeared that the opportunity for the Union to process this grievance had been afforded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.111" offset="4655835">They had been called on and they had not done it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.064" offset="4671613">So, without the frustrating responses, short of the actual operation of the grievance machinery, the Maddox rationale here, as I have read it here, seems to me to clearly apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="1480.220" offset="6024234">I think they are susceptible to that without stretching it beyond the opinion, beyond what they say.</text>

            <text syncTime="1493.405" offset="6077001">And in Hayes against the Union Pacific, that was purely and simply a case where the employees were asking for an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement which we concede we're asking for and the company was -- the prime defendant was named Union Pacific Railroad Co.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.435" offset="6185148">This Court held in that case where the charge was collusive discrimination, just like this one, unanimously that that case was decided wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="1553.893" offset="6318895">And, if I can prove that and if any plaintiffs similarly situated and can make a charge like this and make it stick, then I submit, under the footnote 4 Conley against Gibson, that they should have that right and the doors of the Court should be open.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.137" offset="6391933">Now, in Vaca against Sipes, there were three separate viewpoints expressed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1641.833" offset="6670712">The Preemption Doctrine, however, has never been rigidly applied to cases where it could not be fairly be inferred that Congress intended exclusive jurisdiction to lie with the NLRB.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.317" offset="6720658">Well, this is an NLRB case but I think that expression equally fits the NRAB.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.388" offset="6748975">While these exceptions in no way undermine the validity of the preemption rule were applicable, they demonstrate that the decision to preempt Federal and State Court jurisdiction over a given class of cases must depend upon the nature of the particular interests being asserted and the effect upon the administration of national labor policies of concurrent judicial and administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.787" offset="6850539">It is not applicable to cases involving alleged breaches of the Union's duty of fair representation, which I think applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.295" offset="6888573">It can be doubted whether the Board brings substantially greater expertise to bear on these problems than duly Courts which had been engaged in this type of review since the Steel decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.401" offset="6952939">In addition to the above considerations, the unique interests served by the Duty of Fair Representation Doctrine have a profound effect in our opinion on the applicability of the preemption rule to this class of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.010" offset="7007378">The Court recognized in Steel that the congressional grant of power to a Union to act as exclusive collective bargaining representative with its corresponding reduction in the individual rights of the employee, so represented, would raise grave constitutional problems if Unions were free to exercise this power to further racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.248" offset="7100374">Since that landmark decision, the duty of fair representation has stood as a bull work to prevent arbitrary Union conduct against individuals stripped off traditional forms of redress by the provisions of federal labor law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.787" offset="7170487">However, because these contractual remedies have been devised and are often controlled by the Union and the employer, they may well prove unsatisfactory or unworkable for the individual grievant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.331" offset="7232658">An obvious situation in which the employee should not be limited to the exclusive remedial procedures established by the contract occurs when the conduct of the employer amounts to a repudiation of these contractual procedures.</text>

            <text syncTime="1820.636" offset="7385945">At the beginning of my address, I should like to point out, first of all, that this is not a Civil Rights Act suit and point out, as the Court below pointed out in the memorandum opinion, that, substantially, the same plaintiffs have alleged a violation of their civil rights under Title 7 and that particular matter is being processed at the present time in the Net case to which reference was made in the book article commented upon by Mr. Acker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.257" offset="7524394">So that any possible unfair employment practices which had been committed against these individuals, and I do not at all concede or intimate that any were committed, is in the process of litigation in the lower Courts at the present time and has no real connection with the instant case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1902.285" offset="7712475">The group of petitioners involved is a racially mixed group, as Mr. Acker pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.271" offset="7740479">There are, I believe, eight Negro members of the group and six White members of the group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.350" offset="7764720">So, it is not, on the surface, a normal type of racial discrimination case where all of the members are members of a minority racial or religious group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.011" offset="7823444">The Brotherhood and the carrier, and I am speaking in this instance for both of us, holds no brief for racial discrimination in any form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.285" offset="7876524">The Brotherhood and the carrier concedes that no contract or arrangement which makes invidious discriminations or hostile discriminations based on race, color, creed, and national origin could be or should be countenanced, and that is not the issue in the case in its present posture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.881" offset="7974849">The question involved is whether the plaintiffs pleaded a sufficient attempt to exhaust the administrative contractual remedies to allow them to remain in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.890" offset="8042977">The case has an interesting parallel to the Court's decision in Vaca versus Sipes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.232" offset="8072338">In Vaca versus Sipes, the Union alone, as the Court would recall, was named in the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.639" offset="8105880">But, in the Court's opinion, the Court indicated that perhaps the employer should have been joined in that particular action because, in fact, both the employer and the Union had interest and could be adversely affected by the nature of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.016" offset="8187486">Now, in Vaca versus Sipes, which was not a case arising under the Railway Labor Act, the claim against the employer for wrong -- for breach of the collective bargaining contract, for wrongful discharge, if you will, was a legally cognizable claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.520" offset="8257494">It was a justiciable claim, and the claim against the Union for breach of the duty of fair representation was a legally cognizable claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.208" offset="8300231">So, this Court, I believe, quite properly held that the two could, and perhaps in future suits subsequent to Vaca, should be joined together in one action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.280" offset="8340459">But, in the present case, the claim of the employee against the carrier for violation of his employment rights as embodied in a collective bargaining agreement, and perhaps in customs and practices, has been uniformly held by this Court for a number of years to be non-justiciable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.469" offset="8433246">This claim, under no stretch of the imagination, can be combined with a claim against the Union for alleged breach of the duty of fair representation because, as Mr. Justice White indicated in some of his questions, the matter must be submitted before the National Railroad Adjustment Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="2245.810" offset="9086621">And, I think, as a matter of fact, it has been recognized by this Court that miscarriages of justice will probably result if judges who are not experts in railroad matters and are not familiar with the railroad parlance should attempt to interpret these agreements in the customs and practices that also are, at times, are embodied in the agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2377.255" offset="9612413">Now, I concede, on behalf of the Brotherhood, that the Brotherhood is amenable to suit not under the terms of this collective bargaining contract which is to be construed exclusively by the Adjustment Board, but is amenable to suit on the theory that it failed to accord the plaintiffs their right of fair representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.728" offset="9710320">And, I think this case raises the question whether a plaintiff, who is a railroad employee and is represented by the Brotherhood and is also a member of the Brotherhood.</text>

            <text syncTime="2448.080" offset="9895685">I think this is very similar to the problem that was posited in Conley versus Gibson, except that, in Conley versus Gibson, the question whether those particular members of-- those particular employees who were in the Clerk Crafter class had any Union remedies to exhaust.</text>

            <text syncTime="3553.766" offset="14318425">To go back to the point which I left at the noon recess, in talking about the Tungsten case and the Steel case, it seems to me, that the carrier and the Brotherhood again say that, regardless of who the parties were in those cases, the cases involved the question of the duty of a labor Union to accord to minority members of a craft or class fair representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.234" offset="14436289">And, I think that's put in sharp outline by the opening statement of Chief Justice Stone who said the question is whether the Railway Labor Act imposes on a labor organization, acting by authority of the statute as exclusive bargaining representative of a craft or class or railway employees, the duty to represent all the employees in the craft without discrimination because of their race and, if so, whether the Courts have jurisdiction to protect the minority of the craft or class from the violation of such obligation and point out further, again, regardless of who the parties were, that was the issue, that the Court also noted that there were no differences between the parties in the Steel case, or in the Tungsten case for that matter, as to the interpretation of the contract at page 205 of the Court's opinion there's -- nor are there any differences as to the interpretation of the contract which, by the Act, are committed to the jurisdiction of the Railroad Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.535" offset="14669511">Now, in the Tungsten case, it's true that it was a discriminatory application but, again, it was filled in that case that the Union was the party, the guilty party, the most guilty party that violated this duty of fair representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.505" offset="14729383">Now, again, in Conley versus Gibson, the thrust was against the Union for refusing to process these grievances, and we concede in this case that the Union cannot discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.605" offset="14777762">There is no problem, in my mind, about that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3782.930" offset="15235114">In that case, they were talking about the breach of the Union of its duty of fair representation and they said this is not the claim that you go to the Adjustment Board, and I will concede they said perhaps it wouldn't be a fair tribunal in weighing the Union's duty because it was a Union appointed representative and tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.583" offset="15317661">I am saying, and I hope that I've been clear in this, that the question of contract interpretation, pure and simple, is the only question that I believe is properbly -- properly referable to the Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3818.190" offset="15376175">And, I am conceding with Justice Marshall and with other Justices in the Court that the claim for breach of the duty to treat members of the craft or class fairly is a claim that is cognizable in the Court and I say on that claim, which is a judicially cognizable claim, since he's a member of the Union suing his Union, he should first make some attempts to exhaust the remedies.</text>

            <text syncTime="3863.372" offset="15556838">As I understand Mr. Fisher, he is saying that these plaintiffs must go and must have gone three separate routes and that they must fragment their claim, that is that they must take their Union claim to the Union, and their claim against the company to the company grievance machinery and, thereafter, to the Railroad Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3886.999" offset="15651401">I don't think that could be done in two years, whether you did it simultaneously or not but, in any rate, he's requiring a fragmentation and he is saying that there's no right at any time anywhere to sue the Union and the company together in one -- before one tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3905.931" offset="15727052">Now, that ground was not in the motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.675" offset="15742098">They don't day in the motion to dismiss that you have no right in this Court to sue these two entities together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3916.685" offset="15770102">They say that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3919.600" offset="15781804">As to footnote 4 of Conley against Gibson, I think what Mr. Fisher is saying is that footnote 4 went further than the Court needed to go to decide that particular case and, therefore, it's dictum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3935.338" offset="15844707">And, he might be right there, but I do think that what the Court said in that footnote 4 was carefully reasoned and was correct and should become the law in any case where, very clearly, that question that appeared in Hayes against Union Pacific is presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.682" offset="15930075">No question about that in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3959.072" offset="15939688">Now, as to one other thing -- my time is --</text>

            <text syncTime="3963.784" offset="15958497">One other thing, the remark was made and was made in briefs that Mr. Dent has availed himself of the remedy provided him or attempted to, he's been unsuccessful thus far, the remedy provided by the Civil Rights Act in 1964, in which I'm not involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3980.865" offset="16026833">Now, I will say only one thing there.This case here certainly should not rise or fall on what one of the petitioners here is doing in another case, outside the control of counsel in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3997.855" offset="16094751">But, if Mr. Dent is successful there, ultimately after having them thrown out there as he was here, he will not be entitled in the Civil Rights Act to damages, which is what we're talking about when we're talking about laws of seniority in job rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4012.686" offset="16154102">We're talking about money.</text>
            <text syncTime="4015.499" offset="16165386">Thank you.</text>
