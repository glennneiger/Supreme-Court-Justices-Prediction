            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="33.800" offset="238529">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.645" offset="257964">This is a federal tax case here on a writ of certiorari from the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.117" offset="303835">Although it is a tax case, it is a sequel or consequence of a decision rendered by this Court in 1958 in Wisconsin Pipeline Company against the Corporation Commission of Oklahoma where this Court held that the Corporation Commission of Oklahoma had no power to fix minimum rates for the sale of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.712" offset="426193">The respondent taxpayer here produces and sells natural gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.487" offset="457331">During the years 1952 through 1957, it charged its customers, those increased rates pursuant to the order of the Oklahoma Corporations Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.427" offset="529115">Naturally, the amounts which it received were income to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.123" offset="555865">They entered into the computation of the “gross income from the property” against which it took in each of those years, 1952 to 1957 a deduction of 27.5% as percentage depletion pursuant to Section 613 of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.961" offset="667251">There's no doubt that it was entitled to this deduction for depletion as it clearly receive the gross income under a claim of right that the statute provided that where income is received from oil and gas, there is a depletion deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.373" offset="748857">A taxpayer has his option to take either cost depletion or percentage depletion.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.416" offset="772995">In this case, percentage depletion was advantageous and that was what was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.030" offset="803506">Following this Court's decision in the Pipeline case, and the respondent was sued by several of its customers on the ground that they had been overcharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.240" offset="852302">And it promptly having no defense to that case in 1958, it settled that controversy with two of them and paid to them an aggregate of $505,536.00 in 1958 and it is the company's tax year 1958 and only that year which is before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.320" offset="976645">The question is the consequence or the way in which it should be treated of that repayment made in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.723" offset="1018232">The taxpayer deducted the repayment in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.221" offset="1036204">We say that the deduction allowed in 1958 should be reduced by the amounts previously allowed as deductions for percentage depletion in the years 1952 through 1957, that is by 27.5% and that is the issue to which I will return after the recess.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="253.631" offset="1117915">We'll recess now.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="261.254" stopTime="850.950">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="261.254" offset="1148426">As I was saying before the recess, this case involves two payments aggregating $505,000.00 made by the respondent in 1958 which represented repayments of excess charges for gas which it had sold in the years 1952 through 1957 for which it had received payment and against which payments it had deducted the statutory percentage depletion in the amount of 27.5%.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.444" offset="1317177">Taxpayer's contention is that it is entitled to deduct the entire amount of the repayments made in 1958 despite the fact that depletion had already been deducted with respect to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.419" offset="1385096">There is some discussion in the briefs as to whether this deduction is under the deduction for a loss or the deduction for business expense as suggestion made that the Government has changed its ground on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.875" offset="1450924">I do not think that that is the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.487" offset="1465344">The stipulation in the matter on page 18, the last line of the page in the appendix simply says that they took a deduction but I spend no time on this because I do not think it is important or of any consequence in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.128" offset="1551862">The District Court agreed with the Government's argument and entered judgment for the Government based on the position that the deduction for 1958 should be reduced by the amount of percentage depletion which had already been allowed as a deduction with respect to the payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.031" offset="1643499">On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.867" offset="1666800">It then granted the Government's petition for rehearing but after the rehearing, the Court adhered to its earlier decision by a two-to-one vote, Judge Hill writing an extensive dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.620" offset="1745899">Now, with respect to the law, I think that it can fairly be said that what is really involved here is basic questions of proper tax accounting and it was because of the undesirability of having clear principles already established by this Court made confusing that we felt that it was important to seek a review here.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.328" offset="1880691">The case also involves Section 1341 of the Internal Revenue Code and I'll turn to that in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.880" offset="1930846">I think it's fair to say though that even though Section 1341 must be considered, the proper conclusion is that on consideration, one could come to the conclusion that Section 1341 is in fact bypassed in this case and that the case should be decided exactly as it would be decided if Section 1341 had never been enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.466" offset="2065220">Now, the relevant portion of Section 1341 is set out on pages 10 and 11 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.014" offset="2103463">It is also in the appendix to both briefs of elsewhere but looking at page 10 of the Government's brief, we find that it starts out with if and then there are five numbered paragraphs.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.145" offset="2183920">The first three are conditions to the application of the section and I would point out that paragraph 1 says, if an item, and I would call attention to those words, “an item was included in gross income for a prior taxable year or years because it appears that a taxpayer have an unrestrictive right to such item.”</text>
            <text syncTime="545.684" offset="2286111">Now that's the payments which the respondent receives in the year 1952 to 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.537" offset="2309517">Two, a deduction --</text>
            <text syncTime="554.205" offset="2320175">Now, I call your attention to the fact that that is not the same word.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.911" offset="2338983">It is a different word.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.925" offset="2347029">It does not follow that the deduction is in the same amount as the item.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.622" offset="2365837">The deduction is whatever is the appropriate amount of deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.918" offset="2383078">In the light of the fact that an item was received “a deduction is allowable for the taxable year because it was established after the close of such prior taxable year or years, that the taxpayer does not have an unrestrictive right to such item or to a portion of such item” and that condition is met here.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.500" offset="2461341">And three, “the amount of such deduction exceeds $3000.00.”</text>
            <text syncTime="593.630" offset="2477850">That condition is met.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.155" offset="2484015">Then the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year shall be the lesser of the following and now there are the two-numbered paragraphs 4 and 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.887" offset="2534902">I think it's convenient to say the taxpayer has his option of proceeding under one or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.944" offset="2559143">Actually, the statute says that the tax shall be the lesser of these two.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.828" offset="2582653">Four, the tax for the taxable year computed with such deduction and you'll notice, the deduction goes back to the item in the word in paragraph 2 or 5, and 5 is barely long but it says, in substance that the other matter which is to be computed in determining which is the lesser is in effect to take the amount out of the prior taxable year reducing the taxes for this year by the taxes which were as it now develops improperly paid in the earlier year.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.307" offset="2780557">Now, the fact is that Section 1341 (a) (5), the language on page 11 of the Government's brief was not utilized by the taxpayer here.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.179" offset="2848057">This case arises with respect to Section 1341 (a) (4) which provides the tax for the taxable year computed with such deduction is the amount which is to be taken into account and I suggest that that leaves the situation exactly where it would have been if Section 1341 had never been enacted because the tax for the taxable year would be computed with such deduction prior to the enactment of Section 1341.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.096" offset="2999777">The taxpayer here has simply found it desirable not to use the relief which Section 1341 provided through paragraph 5 because that would have been less advantageous to get at its claim under paragraph (a) (4) and interestingly enough, this was expressly recognized by the court below in its first opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.217" offset="3128195">This is on page 42 of the appendix in Judge Seay's opinion beginning the first full paragraph on that page, “Thus, it appears that Congress by Section 1341 enacted the existing rule as to current year deductions and added another provision.”</text>
            <text syncTime="788.458" offset="3257240">But 1341 (a) (4) is simply the existing rule, the rule that would have been applicable if 1341 have never been passed and then later in the same paragraph, a little below the middle of the paragraph, “Thus, it must be concluded that Congress sought to make no change in the current year deduction remedy but only added the recomputation provision.”</text>
            <text syncTime="819.127" offset="3379911">And in our view, the court was thoroughly sound in saying that but simply did not pursue it through to its conclusion because the majority of the court below reached its result in effect by construing Section 1341 and saying that the word deduction in those several provisions must be read as having the same meaning as the word “item” in paragraph 1.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="946.123" offset="3887835">Suppose they had had a smaller loss or putting it another way, Section 1341 is very much a consequence of this Court's decision in the Arrowsmith case.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.763" offset="3942379">The Arrowsmith case involved a situation where the taxpayer received an amount in liquidation of a corporation in one year and returned that as income as a capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.958" offset="4007163">In a later year, it was required to make a payment with respect to that on the ground that it was a transferee from the corporation and the corporation owed money.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.377" offset="4056900">There was no suggestion that they were not entitled to deduct the amount in the later year.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.181" offset="4080097">The only question in the Arrowsmith case was whether the deduction was as a capital loss or as an ordinary loss and this Court held that since the repayment in the later year arose out of the capital transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.122" offset="4159822">It was to be treated as a capital loss and that is a case which we think supports our position here but the problem which it presented was that capital losses are subject to superior restriction as to their deductibility and they might have included the amount in the earlier year in income be entitled to deduct it as a capital loss in the later year but get very little benefit from it, and it was for that reason that 1341 (a) (5) was enacted to say that if they got little benefit from it in the later year, they could reduce their tax for the later year by the amount of tax which they paid in the earlier year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.200" offset="4332126">You also get similar situations where there are changes in the tax rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.148" offset="4355950">In this particular case, the tax rates were exactly the same in each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.239" offset="4384371">There were no losses that affected the situation, no carryover, so that the only reason the taxpayer wanted to use 1341 (a) (4) was because it thought as the Tenth Circuit held that such deduction in 1341 (a) (4) meant the same thing as the item or an item in 1341 (a) (1) and allowed the taxpayer to deduct the entire amount of the payment despite the fact that 27.5% had already been deducted with respect to the same payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.673" offset="4566079">Now, we contend that that is wrong as a matter of principle, that this is in the area of proper tax accounting long since established by decisions of this Court that Section 1341 was wrongly construed by the court below and that when it is rightly construed, it leaves the well-known decisions of this Court in full operation which would require the adjustment for which the Government contends.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.965" offset="4723231">Now, in some ways the closest of these cases is one that was decided long ago, United States against Ludey, decided in 1927, opinion by Mr. Justice Brandeis who had a very excellent grasp of the accounting background and problems in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.217" offset="4844231">Brief for the United States was written in the time of Solicitor General Mitchell and I was much interested in reading that brief to find that the argument which he then made is essentially the argument which we are trying to present here and it is the argument which was accepted by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.790" offset="4942555">The Ludey case involves the determination of the amount of gain on the sale of a mining property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.238" offset="4984351">It arose with respect to the year 1917 which was before there was any provision in the statute providing for the adjustment of basis of property on the sale of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.815" offset="5054673">The statute provided explicitly that the basis of property shall be its cost or its March 1, 1913 value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.335" offset="5096678">In that case, the taxpayer had deducted the depreciation on its machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.303" offset="5120606">It had deducted depletion with respect to its oil which had been taken out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.979" offset="5155297">But when they came to sell the property, they computed their loss by taking the full cost with no adjustment for the depreciation and depletion which had been sustained and the Court of Claims supported the taxpayer in that and said that there was no basis in the statute for the adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.765" offset="5266474">There was some controversy as to amount of the adjustment if it was to be made namely whether it was the amount which the taxpayer had actually deducted or depletion and depreciation or whether the adjustment to basis should be the amount which they could have deducted if they had taken all that they could and should have taken and this Court in the opinion by Justice Brandeis and let me emphasize again without any explicit statutory provision, simply as a matter of general principles of tax accounting, held that in computing the gain or loss on the sale, the basis must be adjusted by the amount of depreciation and depletion sustained and remanded the case to the Court of Claims to determine that amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.284" offset="5512547">Now the next case chronologically which provides a part of this basis for determining sound principles of tax accounting is Charles Ilfeld Company against Hernandez in 292 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.545" offset="5601573">Now that is a case where a parent company had some subsidiaries and if filed consolidated returns with those subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.066" offset="5647653">The subsidiaries had losses in nearly all of the years involved and the effect of the consolidated returns was that the subsidiary losses were deducted against the parent's income which was entirely right and appropriate as the function of consolidated return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.375" offset="5728841">But in the year 1927 which was involved in that case, the parent liquidated the subsidiaries and since the subsidiaries had had consistent losses, the parent got very little out of the subsidiaries when it liquidated them and it sought to deduct on its tax return the amount of the loss which it sustained on the liquidation of the subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.942" offset="5855169">Here again, there was nothing in the statute which dealt expressly with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.808" offset="5878575">There was a statutory provision giving the Commissioner broad power to make regulations in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.826" offset="5906683">The Commissioner had made regulations but none of them really quite fit this particular situation and in the Ilfeld case, an opinion by Justice Butler, the Court held that the loss could not be taken because in the Court's language and this is quoted on page 19 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.499" offset="6017337">If allowed, this would be the practical equivalent of double deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.835" offset="6050670">And that of course is exactly the situation which is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.389" offset="6068955">If the taxpayer here is allowed to deduct the entire amount paid in 1958, it will with respect to this transaction have deducted an aggregate of 127.5% of the amount paid because it has already deducted 27.5% as percentage depletion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2208.833" offset="8938663">That is true but 1341 says it is the amount included in gross income which prevails.</text>

            <text syncTime="3512.294" offset="14152600">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.839" offset="14170676">And I must say that the election of the percentage depletion of course results in the tax benefits of the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.761" offset="14222399">But there's no way it seems to us that the payment of money which is what happened to the taxpayer here can give rise to a reduction in any basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.366" offset="14288854">There's no way we can add to the basis of our properties because we didn't acquire them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.048" offset="14311528">We never got the mineral back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.582" offset="14325739">We're not talking about the double deduction of the Ludey or Ilfeld cases here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.297" offset="14372551">They're separate complete unrelated deductions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.248" offset="14392404">Settlement of a lawsuit and the payment of the dollars involved in that had no more to do with the prior year's production except as the basis of the claim against this than the payment of compensation or interest in the later year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.364" offset="14456874">We also find it difficult to accommodate the line of cases which the Government decided in which the thrust is that previously deducted items become income in the year of recapture or restoration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.477" offset="14537331">We would point out to you that in the year 1958, the taxpayer never recovered anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.740" offset="14570350">The mineral which it produced was long gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.700" offset="14590203">It's the impact of the settlement of a lawsuit on its operations for that year was entirely disadvantageous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.444" offset="14637119">There was no recovery, there was no restoration and those cases are therefore we submit inapplicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.165" offset="14675989">It seems to us that the percentage depletion allowance, because of its peculiar impact on the taxpayer, because it doesn't relate to cost or discovery value or any other stated amount gives rise to conditions which are probably not reconcilable with established doctrine in other areas with Ludey.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.943" offset="14799182">It had a cost basis for this property and will recover that cost through cost depletion and depreciation or with Ilfeld who had a cost basis in the stock for its subsidiary companies and effectively recovered that basis through the absorption of the subsidiaries' losses against its income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.395" offset="14900955">That is the thrust of our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.678" offset="14910046">If Congress had intended the result contended for by the taxpayer -- by the Government here, it would have been simply done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.985" offset="14943274">I referred earlier to the Court of Claims case decided in 1953 which showed how simply it could be done, United States against Perry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.911" offset="14982980">In that case, the taxpayer donated property to a charity, deducted the amount on its return in the year of the donation and recovered the property in a later year to a tax detriment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.043" offset="15047555">The Court of Claims sought the fair way to do it would be to look back and see what tax advantage did he get from the donation in the year he made the donation and said that that should be the measure of his tax detriment in the year of recovery but the very Government that is here urging that approach to the Skelly case prevailed upon the Court of Claims to overrule the Perry decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.090" offset="15175764">Pointing out that the annual accounting concept so ingrained in the tax law by the decisions of this Court made that result impossible under the law and on the urging of the Government, the Court of Claims recognized this error, went to the annual accounting concept even though the taxpayer in the Alice Phelan Sullivan case suffered tax-wise drastically.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.072" offset="15323617">It's a two-way street.</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.465" offset="15337200">There's going to be tax equalization, it's got to be equalization for the Government and for the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3814.877" offset="15362905">Under the law as enacted by Congress, there cannot be tax equalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3821.089" offset="15387773">The arguments advanced to this Court to overrule the decision below are more properly advanced we submit to the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.204" offset="15424240">Thank you.</text>
