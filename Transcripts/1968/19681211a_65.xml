            <label>Mr. Robert J. Haft</label>
            <text syncTime="12.245" offset="152325">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.528" offset="169462">This matter is before the Court on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals to the Fifth Circuit, involves two offenses relating to the possession of one-half ounce of marihuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.108" offset="215855">The first defense was a conviction under the Marihuana Tax Act and the second was a conviction under the importation statute, Section 176a of Title 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.205" offset="272175">The two questions presented to the Court are first, the -- whether the Fifth Amendment privilege is a defense to a prosecution under the Marihuana Tax Act, and the second question is the constitutionality under the Due Process Clause of the presumption in the importation statutes which presumes importation in fact of marihuana and knowledge in fact by the defendant of such illegal importation.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.285" offset="400488">Both inferences flowing from mere possession alone are facts in the case are quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.725" offset="430268">The petitioner had an automobile trip from New York to Laredo, Texas, tried to enter Mexico, was denied entry, came back to Laredo and was search thoroughly at customs and the less than a half an ounce was found.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.706" offset="498186">At the trial, petitioner took the stand and admitted acquisition of the marihuana in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.239" offset="528280">On the first issue, that is whether the Fifth Amendment privilege is available as a defense to a Marihuana Tax Act prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.499" offset="565373">I think the Court's language in the Grosso case is particularly at, that is at the hazards of incrimination ought to be measured by literal and full compliance with all the statutory requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.139" offset="615946">The Government has no argument on that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.027" offset="627440">They simply say that literal and full compliance with the statute is quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.058" offset="651577">A proposed illegal possessor of marihuana can not pay, prepay the marihuana tax, cannot obtain an order form from the Secretary or the Treasury, and therefore is absolutely prohibited from obtaining marihuana and hence argues the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.850" offset="734751">There were no hazards of incrimination under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.907" offset="746977">You just cannot acquire marihuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.062" offset="759620">Our petitioner's position is that the plain meaning of the Act, the legislative history of the Act and in fact the Government's position in a case before this Court are completely contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.210" offset="808208">A brief review I think of the statutory scheme will be helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.581" offset="825657">The Order form requirement under the Marihuana Tax Act states that a written order form must be obtained prior to any transfer of marihuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.372" offset="868812">There are no significant exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.686" offset="882082">The tax is imposed on all transfers required to be accompanied by a written order form, and of course all must be accompanied by such an order form.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.046" offset="923564">The tax is a very interesting one, it is a dollar an ounce on registered transferees, that is persons whose activities in relation to marihuana are lawful and who have registered and paid the special occupational tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.944" offset="983124">And in the case of all others to with unregistered persons, persons whose possession is likely to be unlawful, the tax is $100.00 per ounce.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.273" offset="1036413">There are very clear schemes for statutory disclosure under the Marihuana Tax Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.506" offset="1065357">The written order form, a duplicate must be preserved in the internal revenue district for two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.004" offset="1091375">It's available to federal state and local prosecutors and admissible in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.818" offset="1114676">Now, against this very clear statutory scheme compelling incrimination, it seems to me we have to deal with the Government's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.087" offset="1151770">Government's position is that they have had a policy since the passage of the Marihuana Tax Act in 1937 of construing that Act in pari materia with the 1914 Harrison Anti-Narcotic Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.217" offset="1212270">Under the Harrison Act, it expressly states that only registered persons, persons who have paid the occupational tax can obtain an order form.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.575" offset="1253648">It's expressly in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.256" offset="1264410">The Marihuana Tax Act on the other hand clearly states the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.489" offset="1281337">It says that every person whether or not registered and whether or not you've paid the special tax must obtain an order form prior to the acquisition of marihuana.</text>

            <text syncTime="322.555" offset="1393560">No, but I think that the pattern is very clear here under the Harrison Act since it permits only lawful transfers, the tax is very low, its one cent per ounce because it contemplates only legal transfers.</text>

            <text syncTime="338.053" offset="1455626">No, it is one cent because everything under that Act is only legal under the Marihuana Tax Act, this is a very clear distinction that dollar an ounce for legal transactions and a $100.00 an ounce for illegal ones for transfer permitted in a $100.00 an ounce case.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="365.342" offset="1564714">These are people who are convicted under this Act for illegal transfers then have to pay the tax?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_j_haft" startTime="372.380" stopTime="730.971">
            <label>Mr. Robert J. Haft</label>
            <text syncTime="372.380" offset="1592926">They have a civil liability to pay it and there have been actually civil proceedings independent of criminal proceedings, and I think United States against Sanchez before this Court raised that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.664" offset="1646007">The legislative history if the plain meaning were not enough, a legislative history of the Marihuana Tax Act clears this point; very clearly that everybody was intended under that Act to be able to receive marihuana under a transfer, under an order form.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.057" offset="1711626">Clinton M. Hester, who was assistant general counsel to the treasury, testified before both the House and Senate committees in 1937 with reference to the Tax Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.315" offset="1756662">He said that this Act is different than the Harrison Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.776" offset="1770454">Under the Harrison Act, only legal persons in licit transactions can obtain Harrison narcotics, but under this Act, the Marihuana Tax Act, anyone can get marihuana just as under the National Firearms Act, and the analogy was bought out by the treasury sponsor.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.435" offset="1853106">Just like under the National Firearms Act, this Act, the Marihuana Tax Act which permit transfer of Marihuana to anyone but of course upon the payment of a heavy tax as in the National Firearms Act, by golly, anybody could get a submachine gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.070" offset="1919666">And in -- in that very same legislative history, Clinton Hester stated and he spelled out exactly. He said, a person who wants marihuana will go to the collect, pay his $100.00, fill out the order form and give that to the transferor as the transferee would do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.573" offset="2009631">The Government itself totally inconsistent with his new argument, I think highly imaginative one in order to meet the Haynes, Grosso, and Marchetti cases, completely inconsistent with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.777" offset="2058428">In United States against Sanchez before this Court in their brief, the Government said that the Marihuana Tax Act does not constitute a complete prohibition upon acquisition of marihuana by unregistered persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.204" offset="2120182">That instead of doing that, Congress shows to levy a $100.00 per ounce tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.731" offset="2146304">I submit that the regulations under the statute do not change the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.701" offset="2166157">The regulation specifically provide in the case of the order form that if the transferee is registered, it says if registered, put down your registration number, thereby clearly contemplating that persons not registered could obtain the order form.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.659" offset="2230000">Now, I think that the hazard of incrimination under my interpretation which I think is the clearest statutory plain meaning of Act plus the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.060" offset="2275662">I think the hazards are very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.575" offset="2285693">Congress has created a special category, it's a clear red light, $100.00 an ounce, we specially reserve that for illicit transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.434" offset="2329057">And by the way, the legislative history makes that clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.548" offset="2341595">It said it in the House report say the $100.00 is for illicit transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.237" offset="2364270">Now, you're going to have a possessor whose possession is unlawful under virtually the laws of every state.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.830" offset="2394676">Go to the Secretary of the Treasury, tender a $100.00 an ounce tax, fill-out an order form which asks for his name, his address, the quantities he proposes to get, and who is going to transfer it to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.590" offset="2449742">I submit that that is submitting the jail key at the time and I think it's clear the hazards are blatant.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.752" offset="2486418">Now, the Government I think also in recognition of the clear force of this argument has said in many places in their brief, well, the petitioner is some sort of fellow who is on psychedelic cloud number 9, who really doesn't care about this Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.265" offset="2564472">He knew about our policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.880" offset="2574921">He knew about this complete prohibition and he never cared in this matter or gave no concern to the Fifth Amendment privilege in connection with his failure to apply for the tax, to pay the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.700" offset="2630196">Now, in the testimony, in the appendix, pages 86, 87, and 89, I think the testimony completely contradicts that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.700" offset="2670216">Question now, “why didn't you pay the transfer tax in this instance on the marihuana which you had?”</text>
            <text syncTime="647.988" offset="2695293">Answer, “well, I knew that I couldn't get such a permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.048" offset="2711594">I also knew that if I had applied for such a stamp, I would probably subject myself to investigation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="659.641" offset="2741896">Now, as I read the next excerpt, I think it's clear that permission in this context, the petitioner meant applying for registration which is as very clear as applicable only to lawful possessors, there's no difference between the Government and petitioner on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.857" offset="2806784">Question, “Do you the tax on marihuana, the special tax on marihuana?”</text>
            <text syncTime="680.396" offset="2824965">Answer, “its my understanding that for one dollar or three dollars, you can buy some sort of permit.”</text>
            <text syncTime="686.851" offset="2850774">And that is by the way the amount of the occupational tax, a dollar in one case and three in another.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.821" offset="2870627">And that -- and if you have marihuana and don't have a permit, it's a dollar an ounce.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.737" offset="2894346">Question, “Wwhy didn't you pay that?”</text>
            <text syncTime="699.761" offset="2902392">Answer, “I was very certain that I would not be able to pay the tax on the marihuana and not -- not only would it be taken away from me but I would be subjected to Action.”</text>
            <text syncTime="711.066" offset="2947636">Question, “Did you or did you not have an honest belief that you could not obtain the permit for marihuana?”</text>
            <text syncTime="716.456" offset="2969161">Answer, "Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.121" offset="2975848">I had a strong and honest belief that I could not get it and that it would cause a lot of publicity and trouble for both the Government and myself.”</text>

            <text syncTime="755.239" offset="3124328">The last point on the self-incrimination issue, we believe that if we're right on this point that you must reverse on the importation count as well, whether we're correct or not on the presumption point, but that count has to be reversed also because of the trial judge's instructions in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.912" offset="3215026">On the presumption issue, he charged the statutory presumption that the jury may convict unless the defendant explains the satisfaction -- his possession to the satisfaction of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.125" offset="3271868">The judge then added to that, he said, “by that I mean unless the defendant explains that his possession was a lawful and legitimate possession, immediately thereafter, the trial judge charged that a failure to pay the tax, the marihuana tax, the failure to produce the order form on demand rendered the transaction illegitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.604" offset="3369775">So that the jury was in a clear position, in fact was suggesting that they find the possession illegitimate on the importation count based on the failure to pay the tax or produce the order form.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.658" offset="3422020">The second issue before the Court is the validity of statutory presumption in 176a under the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.287" offset="3460472">Now, the statute itself, 176a is a very narrow crime that's defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.982" offset="3487326">It is that whoever knowingly with intent to defraud the United States in any manner facilitates the transportation of marihuana after the same has been imported and knowing that the marihuana has been imported is guilty of a crime.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert J. Haft</label>
            <text syncTime="869.791" offset="3582516">Yes, I believe that's what the intent to defraud the United States means because another part of the statute says marihuana which should have been invoiced, meaning that it should have import duly or levy should have been placed on it at the time of importation.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.659" offset="3662033">Now, these narrow statutory elements are swept away by the presumption which just says that mere possession is presumptive evidence of guilt unless the defendant explains his possession to the satisfaction of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.905" offset="3730996">Now, it's our position that that presumption is not rational, it does not comport with common experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.779" offset="3758477">The issue was raised at the trial by evidence which was introduced showing that marihuana grew in the United States, grew any place in the United States, and offer was made to show the amount of marihuana grown domestically and the proportions of marihuana grow domestically as against importer, that offer was rejected by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.809" offset="3858578">Now, my position is that whether marihuana is imported in fact is an arguable proposition but that whether the defendant in fact knew of the illegal importation, the presumption that he in fact knew in any particular case is an irrational presumption and that in either of that applying the standard of reasonable doubt as is required in a criminal case at best in arguably rational proposition is one that ought to be condemned by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.348" offset="3996714">In the reply brief in this matter, a -- I cite a case entitle the United States against Adams which was decided subsequent to the submission of the Government's brief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.671" offset="4046033">In United States against Adams, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York made various findings which I think are important here.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.091" offset="4087724">I think that the legal rationale of that case is something that of course is before this Court and there's no sense citing another precedent on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.121" offset="4123878">I think the findings are important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.905" offset="4130983">The Court held an evidentiary hearing and made the following findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.875" offset="4150836">One, that marihuana is a plant which grows extensively on a wild basis without fertilization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.061" offset="4179571">It also a plant that is easily cultivated and is very hardy in its growth that is impossible to determine whether any quantity of marihuana is imported or is domestic and that is on scientific investigation of the particular quantity, its virtually impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.241" offset="4260342">Most importantly, the judge found that common experience if anything tends to suggest that most people if not all are under the belief that marihuana is grown domestically and that that explains its wide spread domestic use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.049" offset="4339545">In this regard, the judge relied upon what he considered the stuff of common experience, the everyday newspaper plus with federal and state enforcement officials themselves are saying about this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.744" offset="4390327">And the strongest argument it seems to me on the extensiveness of the domestic growth and the judge found it was very very substantial, was it year after year, the enforcement and officials point out that this is a vital problem, a prevalent problem and they proudly report the vast acreage destroyed in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.975" offset="4479248">And the very next year the Bureau of Narcotics reports another vast amount of acreage that they've found that next year leading to the inference it seems to me that there's a substantial amount that is not discovered each year and which does form the source of supply for domestic -- domestically used marihuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.203" offset="4560227">The judge referred to his reading of the everyday newspaper and he said in one not unsensational newspaper he found five accounts in three months that unsensational newspaper was the New York Times, and one of the article that he cited was on page one of the New York Times, on August 21, 1968, it cited in his opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.365" offset="4652805">In that case, in Jersey, near Hoboken in Jersey City, the state officials had found an area of meadow lands that had 20,000 marihuana plants which they proceeded to destroy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.946" offset="4707140">That one growth was enough to supply one cigarette to every one of the 17 million high schools students in the country, that one area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.395" offset="4744965">In some areas, marihuana is so thick that a truck load can be gathered very quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.545" offset="4765550">Plants, some as high as 10 feet grow along the Susquehanna railroad tracks, the parallel route one along the North Bergin segment of the meadow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.455" offset="4801181">Now, this is a problem which was not really before Congress at the time in 1956 that they passed the presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.737" offset="4838275">At that time, they had Commissioner Anslinger's testimony that 90% of seizures in the United State came from Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.006" offset="4875368">The other testimony was of Texas and border enforcement officials, which is by no means representative of the experience in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.006" offset="4915388">Taking just the acreage destroyed by the Bureau of Narcotics in 1965, the last figure that the bureau itself reported which is on page 17 of their annual report for that year, there were 1,900 acres destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.300" offset="4968573">Using the bureau's own estimate of yield and the estimate of the number of cigarettes per pound from the article I read to you, the 1965 seizures alone, destruction of acreage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.342" offset="5020714">If it had been committed to yield would have produced 2 billion marihuana cigarettes or 10th to every person in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.126" offset="5067839">Marihuana does pass from many hands from the source to the smoker, and I think that's important to attesting whether or not a defendant should he held to know or could know the basic source because this is the kind of thing which is transferred often.</text>

            <text syncTime="1576.588" offset="6409697">With the Court's permission, I would like to address myself first to the question concerning the validity of presumption to which the counsel was just addressing himself, because that is the question that is peculiar to this case and is not related to the -- immediately following case, that's United States v. Covington which also raises the issue raised -- second issue in this case as to the validity of Marihuana Tax Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.013" offset="6523382">Section 176a of Title 21 provides basically that anyone who imports or receives, conceals, or facilitates the transportation concealment or sale of illegally imported marihuana, knowing that it is illegally imported shall be guilty of a federal crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.913" offset="6611048">That statute also contains a presumption written into the statute by Congress, and that presumption in the statute appears at page 44 (a) of the appendix, it provides that whenever on trial for a violation of this subsection, the defendant is shown to have or to have had the marihuana in his possession, such possession shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction unless the defendant explains his possession to the satisfaction of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.811" offset="6750647">It is the Government's position in this case that that statutory presumption is valid. At the outset, I think I should make clear that that does not appear to be a dispute between council as to the proper standard to be applied in determining whether or not a statutory presumption is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.232" offset="6836328">All counsel rely on the articulation of that standard which is found in top the United States where the Court said that the validity of the statutory presumption depends upon the rationality of the connection between the fact proved and the ultimate presumed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1820.562" offset="7385631">Clearly, and this is the ruling in top itself that the fact that a man had been convicted of a crime and he had in his possession a gun could not support an inference that the gun had been transported into state commerce after the passage of the Firearms Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.754" offset="7442369">But I think there are two types of presumptions that the law really recognizes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.874" offset="7458879">One of those that flow, would you might say would flow from logic alone, for example, the presumption that a man found in a stolen car in the state other than the state of theft knew that the car was stolen had in fact transported into state commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.678" offset="7518124">That's presumption that really just flows from the basic fact of finding him in the other state in recent possession of a stolen car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.744" offset="7546337">However, there are other types of presumptions and I think that the presumption in Gainey is one, which depends upon an assessment of certain empirical data.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.325" offset="7584684">In Gainey, you had a situation where Congress determined that it was a reasonable presumption that someone present at an illicit steal side was engaged in the business of operating the illicit steal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.322" offset="7640691">Now as the Court pointed out in that case, I don't think that it necessarily would flow from a matter of logic alone from possession, from presence at the site that the party was engaged in the operation of the steal until you look at some other facts, assess some empirical data relating to the operation of a steal, and that is that people engaged in that type of operation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2708.139" offset="10935881">It may have been that the man in Gainey just wanted onto the site of the steal, but the Court said it was still rational to allow the presumption to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.361" offset="10972766">It maybe a man found stolen car across the border 10 minutes after the car has been stolen in another state, didn't steal it, it just happen to come in, he was tired and sit down but I think that the question here is the rationality of the presumption.</text>
