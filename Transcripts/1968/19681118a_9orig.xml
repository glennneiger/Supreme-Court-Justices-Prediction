            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="87.120" offset="451897">Mr. Justice Black and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.045" offset="467571">Let me make clear at the outset that despite the title of the case, this original action or this face of this original action involves only the State of Texas not Louisiana or as might be otherwise in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.267" offset="532459">It's perhaps fitting that the Court herein apology first for having to hear for the third time since the passage of the Submerged Lands Act another aspect of this title lands controversy between the United States and Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.793" offset="598497">One might have hoped that eight terms ago, when the Court decided that Texas unlike most of the gulf states was entitled to historic claim in the gulf that that historic claim was based on the Republic of Texas Boundary Act which defined the belt of Texas as nine miles from land and the Texas coast being relatively uncomplicated, that might have been the end of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.401" offset="720959">Unfortunately, however, there was that non-resolved matters which came before the Court only at the last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.725" offset="762232">The question then was where you start measuring this nine-mile belt, whether from the present coast or rather from the historic coast, that is the coast in 1845.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.183" offset="820120">The Court there determined that it was measured, was to be measured.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.417" offset="837047">This nine-mile historic belt to Texas had been adjudicated, that it was to be measured from the historic coast, the coast in 1845.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.146" offset="875917">Therefore, one could not take into account artificial jetties that had been put outside of harbors at the Galveston and Sabine Pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.548" offset="925550">When it came to translating the Court's opinion into a decree, we discovered that we've left another problem unresolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.526" offset="977481">It was easy or it was done, it wasn't easy.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.174" offset="996080">The parties did stipulate where the 1845 coast was and that has been stipulated in a written client stipulation which is before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.591" offset="1045713">Texas thought that the next step was simply to measure nine miles out from that which was done and that line has been stipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.184" offset="1088136">However, the Submerged Lands Act contains a provision that no state not even a state in the Gulf of Mexico is entitled to submerge lands more than nine miles from its coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.161" offset="1151979">United States takes a position that nine miles from its coast of that purpose, for the purpose of its limitation means nine miles from the present coast not from the historic coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.850" offset="1210807">Now, it so happens that the Texas coast has eroded substantially over the last century.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.803" offset="1238601">One of the little drawings which have been distributed to the Court indicates the extent roughly of the erosion and the extent of the accretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.972" offset="1275277">The portion of shown in red indicates the erosion.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.896" offset="1302967">That's what concerns us today.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.632" offset="1313938">Because most of the coast has eroded rather than accreted, we do have a difference as to where this nine-mile belt ends up depending on where it begins.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.357" offset="1368795">Now, the real question is as I said, whether this limitation which Texas acknowledges and which is stated in plain words in the Submerged Lands Act that no state shall take more than nine miles from a coast means from the present coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.803" offset="1446536">If it means from the present coast, then we cannot measure from the old coast because that would push the line beyond nine miles from the present coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.142" offset="1527933">Now, the effectiveness is --</text>

            <text syncTime="371.224" offset="1588224">Mr. Justice Black, this problem cannot arise with respect to any other state except Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.040" offset="1615496">It arises with respect to those two states only because they have received grants which come to the very edge of the maximum, the maximum for any state being nine miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.717" offset="1670248">Otherwise, the problem would never arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.703" offset="1686235">While Florida was -- may be affected by the decision here and was duly notified of that fact, it shows not to participate in this face of the controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.374" offset="1736913">Now, as I say, the effect of this translated into one small segment of the coast is depicted on the chart behind me, a copy of which in small form has also been distributed to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.832" offset="1790725">This is chart prepared by the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.760" offset="1806399">But it shows rather clearly what the difference is.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.768" offset="1826461">Last term, we were arguing about the effect of accretion, artificial accretion in that case but the same principle applies to natural accretion whether that pushed out the nine-mile belt.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.267" offset="1884453">The answer was it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.928" offset="1895111">This time, we're arguing about whether the effect of erosion is to bring in the line because otherwise, this final line would be more than nine miles from the present shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.984" offset="1959267">Again, we say that this territory is not properly attributable to Texas under the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.429" offset="1997093">Now, you can see from just that statement that Texas appears to have at least two advantages in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.084" offset="2035754">One is that we appear to be saying, heads we win, tails you lose.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.264" offset="2060413">Whether it's accretion or erosion, Texas gets the benefit of neither.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.760" offset="2086431">Secondly, our position results in a changeable, movable line as the modern coast shifts whereas Texas would have a fixed, permanent line nine miles from the stipulated 1845 coast which would not be affected by any future changes one way or the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="561.092" offset="2347760">Now, as I say, the superficial attraction of a permanent line which is already been stipulated which would certainly spare this Court of any necessity for future litigation if the Texas position where adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.421" offset="2409096">We recognize the simplicity, the attraction of that position but let me say as to the first point, to the point that we seem to be same to Texas on a manner which way it shifts, you don't get the benefit of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.271" offset="2484433">That's not entirely true.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.693" offset="2494151">When there is a shift, when there is accretion of more than six miles, whether that be by natural accretion or by the building more likely, by the building of harbor work, then we would push the line out because in that instance, we would say to Texas, “Now, you're taking not under the historic claim, you're taking three miles which every state has a right to do from its modern coast.”</text>
            <text syncTime="624.947" offset="2603133">This example is illustrated on pages 20 and 21 of our memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.502" offset="2637406">That may be a small compensation for the other effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.576" offset="2653706">The reason it's a small compensation is simply because Texas is in the unusual position of having a nine-mile belt whereas every state but one has only a three-mile belt.</text>

            <text syncTime="1021.363" offset="4188871">There is a more dispositive answer to all this which is that the text of the Submerged Lands Act makes it crystal clear that this nine-mile limitation beyond which no state can take whatever its historic boundary was that this nine-mile limitation reads from “the coastline”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.806" offset="4286568">That word is the same operative word that defines the three-mile grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.390" offset="4308929">That word is expressly defined in the Submerged Lands Act in Section 2 (c).</text>

            <text syncTime="1081.918" offset="4431078">If I am right in that premise, then it follows that this nine-mile limitation must also be measured from the modern ambulatory coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.328" offset="4468694">The confusion here arises only because it so happens that Texas' historic claim is nine miles and the limitation is also nine miles and there's a temptation to make the two read on the same points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.937" offset="4531075">It's the -- case would be far easier to view if there had been a 12-mile historic grant -- historic claim by Texas only nine miles of which was cognizable under the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.198" offset="4600142">In that case, I don't think it would ever occur to anyone to go plot the 1845 shoreline because it would be evident that you only took the first nine miles of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.113" offset="4647790">And even clearer case perhaps would be if the boundary historically in the case of Texas had for instance been set for the southern part on the 97th meridian without any reference to the coast whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.368" offset="4712887">In that case, it would be a great waste of effort to go back and see where the coast was at 1845 since the historic boundary was not related to the coast but was set geographically arbitrarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.552" offset="4777566">In that instance, one would of course read the nine-mile limitation of the Submerged Lands Act read as reading from the modern coast readily available.</text>

            <text syncTime="1962.474" offset="7953220">As I remember, the last time we were here, our positions were almost exactly opposite and here we are simply because there is a difference in who gains an advantage as the simple truth no matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.404" offset="8004942">We were told quite plainly in the opinion that what Congress intended was to give us back what if we had in 1945 all that area that we've had in 1845.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.572" offset="8065651">Even one sentence in the majority opinion states that it's extremely clear, no new state boundaries being created by a state which qualifies and I'm talking about this historical claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.651" offset="8113925">Simply is being given the same area it had when it entered the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.381" offset="8132942">Now, there is only one possible way to do that and that's to use a fixed historic boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.725" offset="8154258">Otherwise, erosion is going to take away something from Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.861" offset="8174843">That's the only possible way to give that effect to the congressional intent is to measure from the fixed historic 1845 boundary as the majority opinion said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.236" offset="8240358">I'm saying simply this sir that the only way that the Court can give effect to the congressional intent to give back to Texas the same area it had when it entered the union is to measure from fixed historical boundary three leagues out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.791" offset="8314546">And that's the only possible way to include all of that area because we have lost somewhere between 17 and 35,000 acres through erosion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.964" offset="8359267">Now, I can't tell you the exact amounts involved because we don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.324" offset="8376717">We have one set of engineers that said 35.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.784" offset="8390510">They have another set of engineers that said 17 while it's somewhere in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.647" offset="8409945">In any event, it's important enough to tell his position on as far as the Government is concerned, they started out saying, “You're stuck with 1845 because they didn't want us to have the jetties.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.695" offset="8458115">We were saying we want 1953 or present because we want the jetties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.197" offset="8484133">Well now that they got the jetties cut away from us, they want to use the historic boundary only when it hurts us and use the modern boundary when it hurts us.</text>
