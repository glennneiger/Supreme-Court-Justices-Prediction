            <text syncTime="80.342" offset="424730">Mr. Nagin.</text>

          <turn speaker="jeffrey_l_nagin" startTime="84.337" stopTime="447.806">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Nagin</label>
            <text syncTime="84.337" offset="440717">Mr. Chief Justice, this case is here on a writ of certiorari to review a decision of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia which reversed a District Court dismissal of the complaints of respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.562" offset="505605">The decision of the Court of Appeals required that the District Court restrain the operation by petitioner under a concession granted by the Secretary of Interior of a mobile interpretive service on the Mall in the District of Columbia, until petitioner secured a certificate of convenience and necessity from WMATC, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Commission, the local agency created by interstate compact between the States of Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.271" offset="672475">A mobile interpretive service which is a term we're going to be using throughout this proceeding, the purpose of this kind of a service is to provide essentially the same type of narrative guided tour as the park service which of course is a department within the Interior Department, the park service provides two visitors of national parks across the country, except that instead of providing the service on a tour which goes on foot, the Secretary is determined that it would be appropriate to provide it in this instance by using motorized trams which would move at speeds not to exceed 10 miles an hour through the points of interest and around the points of interest permitting the tour to go on.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.285" offset="848541">The principal issue in the case is whether the operation of such a mobile interpretive service by the Secretary through a concessionaire is subject to the certification and regulatory requirements of WMATC.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.614" offset="921788">If the operation proposed by the Secretary of Interior is subject to WMATC jurisdiction, then even though the Secretary is determined that there is a need for the service on the Mall, WMATC would not be allowed to permit the service to be conducted unless it, WMATC, the local agency determined that there was a need.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.320" offset="1024606">Furthermore, WMATC would have the obligation to determine that petitioner was qualified to render this service even though the Secretary had made the same determination and if the certificate of convenience and necessity were granted, the local agency would also have the responsibility to supervise under its general regulatory powers the operations of this concession on the Mall.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.656" offset="1134007">The setting of the case, the actual physical setting of the case takes place on the Mall of the District of Columbia and when I use the term Mall, not -- I'm using a little bit generally because it could -- it embraces park areas that are adjacent to the Mall such as the Jefferson Memorial, the Ellipse but these are areas all within the exclusive charge that control of the Secretary of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.617" offset="1233795">I think the -- perhaps the best description of the Secretary's responsibilities in this area are set forth in Sections 1 and 3 of Title 16, United States Code says, the Secretary is charged with the obligation to preserve the -- by such means and measures as conformed to the fundamental purposes of said parks and which purpose is to conserve the scenery and natural and historic objects and the wildlife therein which I guess on the Mall is probably limited to squirrels and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.259" offset="1436400">In line with this responsibility, the Secretary determined that the facilities on the Mall, the interpretive facilities on the Mall were already crowded to the point where both because of population, pressures and vehicular pressures, he could no longer provide adequately for the visitor interpretive services which he wish to provide under his charge of responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.503" offset="1533367">Using the authority conferred upon him by Title 16 including Sections 1 and 3 and Section 20, the Secretary issued a proposed -- requested proposals from private concessionaires to operate an interpretive service on the Mall and a number of private persons responded including petitioner and including the respondent D.C. Transit with proposals.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.392" offset="1636916">The proposal of petitioner was selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.704" offset="1650186">The Director of the park service Mr. Hartzog stated that he felt that the proposal by the petitioner provided the “Best means” of interpretation and operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.636" offset="1701909">He also stated what impressed him most about the petitioner was its “interpretive qualifications.”</text>
            <text syncTime="406.850" offset="1730748">The Secretary and the petitioner entered into a contract in March of 1967 which called for the rendition of this interpretive service.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.591" offset="1765752">The contract specified that the services to be provided on motorized trams, each tram would be manned by a driver and by a guide.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.948" offset="1811205">The guide or interpreter would use a script prepared and or rather approved by the Secretary in interpreting the Mall, this because he felt that the and expressly provided for it in the contract that interpretation, the narration part of the service was a prime consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.218" offset="1892289">The Secretary wants to have --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="447.806" offset="1894588">You don't have First Amendment issue in this case, do you?</text>

            <text syncTime="450.882" offset="1906918">No sir, there is no -- no First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.573" offset="1921651">At least -- at least if there is one, I think my client would be the person who would be in the position to raise it and we're not raising it Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.379" offset="1952893">The Secretary would have complete control over all facilities, over the employees, over the qualifications, over the training, over the time and method of operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.350" offset="1996779">The franchise -- a franchise fee of 3% of the gross would be paid by the concessionaire to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.948" offset="2031156">At the time Universal entered into this concession arrangement, they were advised or actually prior to that they were advised by the Secretary that no other agency had economic regulatory jurisdiction over this particular activity, including, since we had asked the question, WMATC.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Nagin</label>
            <text syncTime="510.489" offset="2145364">Actually, I wasn't aware of the fact that they would make use of any streets outsides of the park area because the streets, the Section 8144 of the District of Columbia Code provides that the streets between park areas are under the regulatory or under the regulation of the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.284" offset="2236479">The trams would cross streets such as 14th Street and so --</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="537.135" offset="2251943">So there -- there would be no pick-up point outside the park area that is so defined.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Nagin</label>
            <text syncTime="544.351" offset="2280782">There would not be any pick-up points outside the park area.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.822" offset="2294680">There's one problem at the end of the park you know where they're doing this construction at 2nd avenue or 2nd street where the trams might have had to go over one small area outside the jurisdiction and control of the park service.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.648" offset="2349955">As a matter of fact, the temporary service which is being operated now to which I'll address myself later that is not going that far and staying wholly on park territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.497" offset="2381406">There is authority if the service is to be extended just in say for one block or for a short turnaround area of a park territory for the Secretary to arrange -- to have this permitted by an exchange of letters with the D.C. Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.232" offset="2444309">Arrangements to do this were initiated but pending the outcome of this litigation, the Interior Department did not pursue them.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="592.794" offset="2474506">Because the Washington Metropolitan Transit Commission or whatever it's called does have jurisdiction, does it not on the District of Columbia streets?</text>

            <text syncTime="607.613" offset="2533857">It does Your Honor, although, one of our theories which I will discuss later would I think even if the trams operated for some distance off the park property would mean the service still exempt from regulation by WMATC for reasons that have nothing to do with Section 8144 and 8108 specifically.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="625.578" stopTime="638.768">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="625.578" offset="2605641">So that it's your understanding that this Court may consider the case as if the -- these trams operated solely on park service area?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jeffrey_l_nagin" startTime="638.768" stopTime="773.533">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Nagin</label>
            <text syncTime="638.768" offset="2658408">Yes, except to the extent that may at some future date because of the turnaround problems go on to District of Columbia streets for a -- you know, for almost what I would cal it de minimis distance and provided of course that the Secretary were able to arrange with the district government for the necessary exchange of regulatory authority which this would require.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.392" offset="2744926">The DC -- WMATC initiated this action in the District Court when petitioner after being advised by the Secretary refused to apply for a certificate of convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.108" offset="2795813">The United States immediately intervened by filing a representation of interest and has participated throughout these proceedings as a party in effect either under the representation of interest or as an amicus at all times supporting the position of petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.344" offset="2856730">Pending the outcome of the loss -- of this action, the petitioner has not operated the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.236" offset="2884315">Starting around September 1, the Secretary utilizing park service personnel and leasing equipment from petitioner has in fact been conducting the service for, well, I guess that's about almost two months now.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.568" offset="2941680">The WMATC complaint at page 5 of the appendix, I think in a sense really sums up or at least gives a feeling as to what WMATC is seeking.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.278" offset="3004479">They say that unless the petitioner applies for a certificate of convenience and necessity, WMATC will be deprived of the opportunity to determine whether the petitioner is qualified to render this service to the Secretary and for the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.176" offset="3080025">Now, significantly, an underplayed throughout this proceeding is the fact that the WMATC has not particularly emphasize the fact that if the compact applies not only with the Sec -- not only with WMATC have the right to determine whether we are qualified but they would also have the right to determine by virtue of the very same sentence that gives them the former power, the right to determine if the service is even needed.</text>

            <text syncTime="910.703" offset="3746147">The records to be kept by the petitioner, the insurance to be maintained, in other words, throughout the entire contract are this complete scheme of regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.137" offset="3783868">If WMATC is correct, then they would have the power to determine the service -- the hours of service, the rates to be charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.316" offset="3820648">They could suspend the rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.496" offset="3825351">They could postpone the effectiveness of rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.770" offset="3834441">They would have -- they would have the usual plenary jurisdictional powers which they do over other regulated agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.448" offset="3873207">The petitioner has consistently throughout these proceedings resisted these assertion of power by WMATC on a number of grounds which I would like to just summarize at this point then we can explore the ones which are most susceptible to oral argument at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.082" offset="3955649">The first is that the propose service is exempt from regulation under the compact by virtue of the exception contained within the compact for transportation by the Federal Government, that's in a sense in answer to Mr. Justice Stewart's question, namely, that even if the service were off of the Mall for some distance if -- if this is transportation “by the Federal Government when provided by a concessionaire, it would be exempt from the compact coverage.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1044.126" offset="4279881">No, not at all, that -- that's the very first issue that -- to which we would address ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.131" offset="4303914">The second of course is that the Mall itself, that is there's a territorial exclusiveness of the jurisdiction here at which the Secretary possesses and since this takes place in -- within that area it's within his exclusive charge of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.037" offset="4355532">The third is that this kind of transportation does not fall within the basic handle by which WMATC claims jurisdiction because it is not “transportation for hire.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.903" offset="4402970">This is a question of course of what is meant by the term transportation for hire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.428" offset="4425122">Lastly, D.C. Transit has claimed that under its franchise which is granted in 1956, it has quite a part from the compact an independent basis for claiming that before the petitioner can operate its service, it must obtain a certificate of convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.500" offset="4489383">I'd like to focus on the point that Mr. Justice Fortas has just mentioned and that is whether this is transportation by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.145" offset="4531911">In our view, transportation by the Federal Government is present in this case because the first place, the Secretary is discharge -- is discharging through this concessionaire a fundamental function which he has traditionally and historically furnished either directly or through concessionaires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.756" offset="4610382">Secondly, the Federal Government through the Secretary has control over every phase of this operation to the same extent as it would if it were conducted by its own employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.499" offset="4661373">Perhaps even more because you don't have certain things like civil service regulations which would permit people -- prevent people from being discharged in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.812" offset="4694601">Thirdly, the petitioner's day to day activity will be physically intertwined with those of the park service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.269" offset="4720410">The trams will bear a park service emblems, the personnel will wear uniforms approved by the park service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.252" offset="4740368">The script, the narrative script, the First Amendment problem which is the very heart of the service will be subject to the park service's approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.314" offset="4772655">The schedule of service, the operation will be tailored to the day to day changing needs on the Mall so that if something has taken place at this Masonian Institute, the service can be rerouted either to take that into account or move around it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.782" offset="4822497">Whether viewed from the standpoint of the public who are the beneficiaries of this service or from the standpoint of WMATC's own regulatory jurisdiction, it makes no difference that the Secretary has decided to do this service through a private concessionaire as opposed to simply using his own vehicles and his own personnel, the control element, the discharge of his responsibility elements are all there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.040" offset="4935555">Finally, quite apart from this of course is the exclusive charge and control which the Secretary enjoys over the Mall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.193" offset="4964185">Since 1898, in a statute not codified in Section 8108, the exclusive charge to control has been delegated now to the Secretary of Interior over these areas and this was made clear in 1909, when Congress extended this charge to control to the roads between park areas and to the sidewalks adjacent to park areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.794" offset="5066585">The Public Utilities Commission and the ICC never were given any statutory authority to regulate activities within this Mall area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.789" offset="5118516">Now, petitioner's -- we've been met by the point by respondents that the PUC in fact did regulate bus lines because they certified an example, one example was given of a bus line that went through a various points to the District of Columbia and went on Washington Drive which is of course is part of the Mall over by the National Galleria and National Art Gallery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.730" offset="5202317">Well, of course, this regulation was not hostile to the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.836" offset="5218722">There would be no incentive for him as long as he wanted to permit the -- as long as he was willing to permit the service to be conducted on the Mall there and did not exclude the vehicles, there really wasn't worth anything for him to do, was he to go to WMATC and say take that one line out so that your certificate will read up to the Mall then we'll be silent about what happens in the Mall and then extends beyond the Mall?</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.628" offset="5317883">No, there is no point to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.245" offset="5324361">There is no advantage to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.619" offset="5329899">The point is that when there is not conflicting -- when there are not conflicting regulatory schemes and if the Secretary is willing to let the activity continue, there is no reason for him to interfere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.665" offset="5378069">However, here we have an activity on the part of a Secretary himself through a concessionaire which he does not want interference and that I think is the essential point, the difference between the fact that the PUC might have in the course of regulating carriers whose activities were -- could be and were substantially outside the Mall area, also, probably without even thinking about it inserted the reference to the traveling one block in the Mall area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.853" offset="5486738">The same thing of course would apply to taxi cabs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.615" offset="5493844">We've seen the maps in the back of a taxi cabs and there is not a big block out there for the rates to be charged in the Mall area but what good would that would have done?</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.102" offset="5527803">I'm sure the Secretary activity if he's going to permit cabs on the Mall, I'm sure he's not going to try and prevent them from a rate structure to be imposed by the applicable authority who gets jurisdiction because the activity is outside of the Mall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.470" offset="5605230">Finally, I'd like to address myself to D.C. Transit's point that its franchise gives it the right to insist on certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.176" offset="5640025">The franchise which is set forth on page 36 (a) at sect of our brief towards the rear provides first a grant of authority to D.C. Transit to operate a mass transit system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.599" offset="5729782">Then in Section 6, there is also a grant to the D.C. Transit the right to operate special charter and sightseeing services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.248" offset="5764368">Section 3 contains a provision that no competitive street railway or bus line, that is a bus line for the transportation of passengers or the character which runs over a given route on a fixed schedule should be permitted without a -- without certification by WMATC as to its necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.691" offset="5838137">Now, we interpret that to apply number one only to the regular route service of D.C. Transit because this in effect not monopoly but this protection to be afforded to WMATC was meant to protect the service which he was being required to render and that is its regular route service, not a permissive -- not a permissive service of sightseeing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.374" offset="5928835">The language competitive Street Railway Line which runs over a given route on a fix schedule, if they didn't insert the competitive, maybe you could argue it also protected the -- the sightseeing service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.024" offset="5991424">And certainly, as the District Court found, this not -- this does not compete at least any significant way with the regular route service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.325" offset="6020681">I think it's rather hard to envision a tram moving at less than 10 miles an hour from various points around the Mall as competing with the regular route service of D.C. Transit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.445" offset="6061119">But even if Section 3 extends its protection to D.C. Transit's sightseeing activities, we still believe that it is not applicable because it requires that the service which is being limited or prohibited itself must travel over a given route on a fix schedule and this service being provided by petitioner will be subject to change from day to day by the Secretary to meet the changing needs on the Mall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.674" offset="6174072">Also, it is not within the usual concept of what is regular route service in the meaning usually given to that term in public utility proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.647" offset="6213987">It says a given route on a fix schedule, that is language which is meant to mean regular route service as far as we can see it and regular route service, the best discussion of that I've seen is in the case cited by respondent -- by respondent D.C. Transit in Bingler, where the District Court pointed out that sightseeing service or tourist service even if it went basically on a relatively fix schedule does not come within the concept of regular route service unless it -- if there is something significant added in addition to the expeditious transportation between points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.065" offset="6371662">In our case, we don't even have expeditious transportation between points, its going to too slow and we have the something substantial added in the sense that the interpretive service which is certainly within that concept of something substantial added, that's the reason why people would be taking the service is -- is present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.514" offset="6449403">Therefore, we can see that D.C. Transit's independent argument has no merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.568" offset="6469674">For the reasons which we have advanced, we believe the Court and respectfully request the Court reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals or remand the case for the direction that the complaints be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.407" offset="6517008">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1674.577" offset="6801638">Congress as the petitioner has shown has vested the Interior Department with exclusive charge and control over the Mall area, one of the most heavily frequented national parks in the whole United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1972.144" offset="7991986">The first, Wittek against or United States against Wittek on the question whether a National Agency Authority within the District of Columbia is going to be impliedly negated or qualified by the enactment of general District of Columbia legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.803" offset="8114552">A second question arises under Yearsley against W. A. Ross Construction Company as to the question whether a concessionaire operating under the close supervision and control of federal officers in the performance of governmental functions is an agent of the United States and acts in place of the United States and in context would be subject to the exclusion for transportation by the Federal Government set forth in Article 12 Section 1 (a) of the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.005" offset="8295424">And third, by analogy to Leslie Miller Incorporated against Arkansas where this Court said the mere existence of duplicate regulatory authority over a federal activity by the Federal Government under one hand and by a Local Government on the other creates conflict and is a frustration of the federal purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.909" offset="8410990">We submit contrary to the broad opinion of the Court of Appeals that if this be so, it is inconceivable that Congress would place administrative control over any part of the National Park program in a tri-state local administrative body.</text>

            <text syncTime="2108.664" offset="8538049">So here, confusion has arisen between the operation in effect of congressional action in the national sector and the operation in effect of congressional action on the local sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.022" offset="8607431">The problem on Wittek was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.150" offset="8619969">Did the Emergency Rent Control Act of the District of Columbia of 1940 apply to federal low rent housing and defense housing within the District of Columbia which was then under the control of the National Housing Administrator and operated by the National Capital Housing Authority?</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.310" offset="8720593">In that respect, this Court said on page 351, it is practically inconceivable that Congress would have subjected the government-owned low rent housing program in the District of Columbia to the additional control prescribed by the District of Columbia Emergency Rent Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.963" offset="8859251">And on 355, the issue is whether the United States through whatever agency it operates is to control -- be controlled in its rental policies by the District Administrator Rent Control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.758" offset="8918392">Here, we were not concerned with an interstate or a state agency but a very creature of Congress in the District of Columbia legislation that was denied that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.252" offset="8976384">But more -- even more important on 358, I think the Court uses language that could almost be paraphrased and applied to the problem before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.921" offset="9023091">It said the Act, referring to the District of Columbia Emergency Rent Act, contains no express reference to the United States as a landlord or to the application of the Act of government-owned housing of any kind.</text>

            <text syncTime="5050.968" offset="20307257">Now, transportation is not defined in the compact but it is not given a restricted meaning other than its general term and we believe that the service that will be engaged in by Universal will be or any concessionaire that its secretaries will be transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5071.534" offset="20389491">The Senate Report to this legislation stated that Title 2 provides the regulatory law which is to be administered.</text>
            <text syncTime="5079.255" offset="20420420">Section 1 defines the scope of the compact and the transportation covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="5084.858" offset="20442781">Now, Section 1 does not say mass transit or any other kind of specialized service but is -- uses the term transportation which we feel embraces all types of transportation services.</text>
            <text syncTime="5098.327" offset="20496697">That language is clear non-unambiguous, nevertheless, it is urged and decided below in the Court -- in the District Court that the term transportation does not really mean transportation, it means mass transit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5112.306" offset="20552600">Now, the Court of Appeals quite obviously reversed that decision and felt the transportation must be construed to mean simply all forms of movement by motor vehicle of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="5124.949" offset="20603173">To reach the determination that its mass transit rather than transportation per se, one must ignore, number one, the plain language of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5134.170" offset="20640057">He must ignore the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="5136.856" offset="20650820">He must ignore the historical concept of regulation and he must ignore previous decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="5146.998" offset="20691362">In each case, that Court said that this Commission's jurisdiction is -- should be given the broadest construction possible and embrace all forms of transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5158.025" offset="20735457">It also conforms to the major principles of law that remedial statutes of the like the compact shall be broadly construed in all exemptions narrowly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5175.612" offset="20805778">The Commission feels it cannot be argued or denied that the function under Universal's contract is that Universal is to perform a movement of people in motor vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="5198.576" offset="20897625">This service is going to be operated on streets.</text>
            <text syncTime="5201.624" offset="20909850">It's going to be operated on public streets regardless of who is the owner and maintainer of that street.</text>
            <text syncTime="5208.744" offset="20938376">It will be in a vehicle that will be owned by a private carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="5213.037" offset="20955512">It will be driven by employees of that private carrier and as the contract itself specifies, those employee shall be dressed so as to be distinctly known as Universal employees, not park service employees but Universal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="5234.368" offset="21040880">Now, what happens when a man gets on at the end of the -- of the Mall to take a tour, he's not only getting in Universal's vehicles driven by Universal's drivers, he pays Universal a fee and that money then becomes Universal's.</text>
            <text syncTime="5250.556" offset="21105560">Clearly, the act of any carrier, any common carrier in this country, this is the role that it performs and that's the role that a -- that a utility carrier provides whether that act is done for the general public which is this case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5265.874" offset="21166895">This is not a service for the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5267.950" offset="21175150">It's a service for the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="5271.178" offset="21188106">Now, contrast that if you will that the USAC transport case in which the transportation being provided there was to the Federal Government itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="5281.404" offset="21228962">Here, the service is not being provided to the government, it's being provided to the millions of people who will come down under the Mall.</text>
            <text syncTime="5294.823" offset="21282670">The federal government is giving up or allowing a carrier to come on its property and operate and perform certain services that it request and would like to see perform for the public and in turn receives a percentage fee of the fares collected through the fare box of that contract carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="5313.929" offset="21359052">Now, today, we have numerous carriers operating under contract with various governmental agencies, department of state, department of defense, the army, the navy and each case, those carriers have authorization from the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="5330.822" offset="21426657">Now, that service is regulated in so far as the standard of service is concerned and in so far as fares are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5337.167" offset="21452048">We have not had one single conflict with those governmental agencies in so far as what service they want and what service is directed and authorized by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="5347.721" offset="21494262">Not one single bit of difference and we submit Your Honors that this would be the case under this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5356.147" offset="21528012">Thank you very much.</text>
