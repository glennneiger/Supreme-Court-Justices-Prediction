            <label>Mr. Earl W. Kintner</label>
            <text syncTime="30.392" offset="224946">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.333" offset="244694">Permit me to premise my remarks by stating that I will focus primarily upon the principle Clayton Act questions presented in this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.359" offset="296835">And Mr. Kucik, my colleague will examine both the questions of causation and damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.092" offset="327764">This case has come to the Court on a petition for writ of certiorari from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit filed on October 9, 1968 and granted by this Court on January 13, 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.873" offset="410833">The petitioner, Clyde A. Perkins filed this suit against the respondent, Standard Oil Company of California in March of 1959, 10 years ago alleging violations of Sections 2 (d), 2 (a), (d) and (e) of the Clayton Act as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.263" offset="500381">In December of 1963, the jury awarded the petitioner actual damages of $336,407.57 which was trebled and attorney's fees of $289,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.784" offset="578539">The case was -- the cause was argued before the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in June of 1965 and then in November of 1967 early two and a half years later after oral argument and four years after the jury have reached its verdict, the Ninth Circuit set aside the jury verdict and ordered a new trial approximately eight months later in July 16, 1968 Court of Appeals denied the appellee's petition for rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.740" offset="722317">Now, before proceeding to a discussion of the Ninth Circuit's Clayton Act holding, I would like briefly to identify the persons involved and state the facts which I think are essential to an understanding of this portion of the Ninth Circuit's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.242" offset="796296">Petitioner Perkins was one of the largest independent distributors in the Pacific Northwest states of Oregon and Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.091" offset="831718">He began business in 1928 with a single filling station and over the years built a wholesale and retail gasoline of business and during the claim period March 2 to December 2, 19 -- March 2, 1955 to December 2, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.463" offset="921266">He lease to operated approximately 60 retail stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.723" offset="942268">Perkins was a wholesaler operating trucking equipment and bulk storage plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.110" offset="967764">He purchased substantially all his requirements from Standard Oil of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.521" offset="993468">There is some indication that he purchased a little else where but the record shows that this was at the instance of Standard to test the market, the price.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.609" offset="1041847">He was required to maintain a bulk storage plant and an inventory on which he paid taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.330" offset="1084688">He could not represent the sole major brand gasoline.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.205" offset="1100152">Now, standard is engaged in all aspects of the oil industry from drilling for crude oil to selling gasoline of retail and during the claim period, he had nearly 30% of the gasoline market in the Pacific Northwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.214" offset="1168280">It was the price leader in the Pacific Northwest, selling its gasoline through its own branded dealers, the Chevron and Signal brands and the wholesalers like Perkins and Signal Oil and Gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.845" offset="1250722">Signal Oil and Gas purchased during the claim period its requirements from Standard Oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.175" offset="1280084">Now, Signal Oil and Gas is a large integrated company engaged both in the production of crude oil and the distribution of gasoline in the western United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.891" offset="1326895">Signal has been both a supplier and a customer of Standard since the early 30's.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.815" offset="1350614">It drew, it supplies directly from Standard storage facilities in near Portland and in Seattle during the claim period and it purchased during that period only from Standard in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.679" offset="1426056">It reinvoice its purchases from Standard, had no storage facilities, had drove from the Standard bulk facilities, it was in competition with Perkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.606" offset="1489795">It reinvoice to Western Hyway Oil Company which was incorporated in 1950 with Signal owning 60% of its stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.200" offset="1528142">Western Hyway functions as Signal's transportation arm in Oregon picking up gasoline from Standard's Willbridge Terminal in Portland and delivering it to retail stations in Portland operated by the Regal Stations Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.162" offset="1600031">Now, these stations there were three were no more than 150 blocks from the bulk plant and Western Hyway's function was to take its trucks and transport to gasoline to those stations from the Standard bulk plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.516" offset="1673488">Regal was formed in 1956 when with Western Hyway owning 55% of the stock and in 1957, Western Hyway, the Signal Oil and Gas subsidiary acquired 100% of the stock of Regal.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.938" offset="1751124">It operated three stations in the Portland area which competed with stations owned by Perkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.673" offset="1786023">Now, these stations were set up near the third quarter of 1956 at the time when -- through to 1957 and early 1957 these three Regal stations in the Portland area.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.199" offset="1856136">At the time when Signal Oil and Gas or when Regal was -- when Signal Oil and Gas which was -- of which Regal was part of the family was carrying on its books, a rebate, an anticipated rebate which was later paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.080" offset="1939728">In fact, the rebate was paid in January of 1957 by Standard to Signal.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.612" offset="1965850">Signal already and anticipated that and had it on its books and had been negotiations since spring for this rebate.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.545" offset="2005556">Now, these stations were set up in that time context these three Regal stations in Portland and they immediately started a price war.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.372" offset="2052890">The Court of Appeals set aside the entire jury verdict in favor of Perkins because some of the petitioners proved on the two-way aspects of his claims, the Section 2 (a) of the amended Clayton Act demonstrated that Signal, the wholesaler obtaining the better price resold the gasoline to Western Hyway who in turn resold to yet another subsidiary Regal.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.967" offset="2151215">The Ninth Circuit rule as a matter of law that Section 2 (a) of the Robinson-Patman Act “does not recognized a casual connection essential to liability between a supplier's price discrimination and the trade practices of a customer is far removed on the distributive letter as Regal was from Standard.”</text>
            <text syncTime="534.388" offset="2240972">In other words, the Court of Appeals says, -- said that Section 2 (a) was limited and terms to three levels of cognizable competitive injury and that the injury to Perkins occasioned by Regal's marketing activities did not come within the purview of those three levels limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.520" offset="2321429">Since, a large part of Perkins' damage was attributable to the activities of Regal which operated at the fourth level distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.683" offset="2354134">The entire verdict was been deemed tainted and set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.711" offset="2374196">We respectfully submit that the Court of Appeals aired in so holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.003" offset="2395408">First, the jury properly could have returned the verdict against Standard on the ground that the effect of its price discrimination the favor of Signal may have been substantially to lessen competition in the Pacific Northwest wholesale and retail gasoline market.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.704" offset="2462177">Section 2 (a) of the amended Clayton Act contains two independent test of illegality.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.001" offset="2491329">It prohibits price discrimination where the effect may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend, to monopoly in any line of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.581" offset="2537723">And then it has another test to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any person who either grants knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with the customers of either one of the then.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.130" offset="2627897">The Ninth Circuit completely ignored the substantiality to lessen competition Standard, a carry over from the original Clayton Act Section 2 and setting aside this jury's verdict.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="643.445" offset="2677112">And tried the case on that basis?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_w_kintner" startTime="647.343" stopTime="794.887">
            <label>Mr. Earl W. Kintner</label>
            <text syncTime="647.343" offset="2692786">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.990" offset="2699368">The -- this was before the Ninth Circuit, it was before the jury, both Standard and Perkins offered charges to the jury and the judge I think substantially and properly charged the jury so that this question of over all injury to competition and tendency toward monopoly was proper before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.271" offset="2812426">Now, I would say that that in retrospect, both Perkins and Standard could've been far more explicit and extensive in submitting proposed charges to the jury and the judge perhaps could've been more explicit and could've charged more extensively.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.220" offset="2892257">But the fact was that the whole question of injury to competition and a tendency toward monopoly was before the jury and the jury even though not as elegantly charged as one -- as some might wish that it were charged was substantially charged and knew what the raise just I was, knew what the questions of fact were, knew what they had to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.966" offset="3039274">The Court of Appeals exalted form at the expense of economic reality by imposing an artificial three-level limitation on Section 2 (a) to prevent discriminations which tends substantially lessen competition in any line of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.808" offset="3114611">It failed to assign any way, the Ninth Circuit failed to assign any way, the fact that Standard's price discrimination has caused a substantial lessening of competition in the Pacific Northwest wholesale and gasoline markets driving out of business one of the areas largest independents.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.030" offset="3195486">Moreover, by basing that limitation exclusively on the number of persons in the distributive chain established by the favored purchaser, that decision, if the Court please, unless reversed will enable large buyers virtually to insure statutory immunity to suppliers which grant them favorable price concessions.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="794.887" offset="3282944">Mr. Kintner, suppose Regal, Western, and Signal had all been totally independent of Standard, no control, no interlocking directorates, no stock ownership up the line, would you still contend that 2 (a) applied?</text>

            <text syncTime="817.679" offset="3374059">I think we have a different factual situation but the realities and petroleum marketing are such that it is the price of the retailer.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.103" offset="3431737">The competition exist at that retail level and if any one went up that change gets a better price and is able to pass along at the retail level that you can have absolute chaos at the retail level.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.899" offset="3494954">And this is a business --</text>

            <text syncTime="848.166" offset="3495999">Well, what I'm trying to get at as I understand that there is stock ownership all the way down the chain here in this case some sort of stock ownership, is that right?</text>

            <text syncTime="909.927" offset="3743117">Well, we have alternative theories on this of course depending on how you read the evidence but the -- we believe and I urge upon the Court that these were two families of gasoline dealers and that through the economic realities that the retailers are tied to particular suppliers, the gasoline business and that it wouldn't matter if there was a lack of ownership here and family connection if the discrimination were passed from Signal down to Regal Stations and Perkins who had his own chain of stations was unable to compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.846" offset="3954709">The damage occurred at the retail level because Perkins either had to take a loss or he had to see his stations compete on an unequal basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1066.372" offset="4368906">Signal and Perkins -- Signal Oil and Gas and Perkins are both independent of Standard Oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.417" offset="4401089">Perkins was required to purchase his oil from Standard Oil and signal did purchase all of its oil from a gasoline from Standard Oil but they were both independent of Standard Oil, they were independent dealers and wholesalers and if the Perkins Company is unfairly discriminated against.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.985" offset="4507355">It is unable to pass down to its chain of distribution the equivalent benefits that can be passed through by Signal and the proof of the putting is in the eating at the retailer level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.736" offset="4586350">Now, I think it makes a harder case if there's a family relationship as there is here and you got alternatives which one didn't have in the Hamm Brewing case where and Duluth and Superior, the distributor -- two distributors of the Hamm Company were unable to compete across the state lines although this was one market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.052" offset="4707558">But the superior distributor was given a better price and his retailers then were able to take advantage of the retailers on the other side of the state line and the same market take the customers away simply because the better price was passed on the line at the retail level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.921" offset="4851022">As we read it, Section 2 (a) prohibits all price discriminations the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition in a commercially significant product and geographic market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.246" offset="4900342">Regardless of the functional level, this is our theory of the case, it was before the jury and all of the economic setting and the charges given by the judge and it is in this instance that we feel that basically the Ninth Circuit was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.827" offset="4986650">And George Van Camp and Sons versus American Can, a 1928 case prior to the passage of the Robinson-Patman Act in 19 -- amendment in 1936 decided -- and decided prior to that amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.576" offset="5045687">The Court rejected the defendant's argument that its price discriminations could not be challenged by a purchaser because the words in any line of commerce must be confined to the line of commerce in which the distributor is engaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.846" offset="5102738">In other words, confined to what is called primary line injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.945" offset="5119143">The Court ruled if the words in any line of commerce literally were satisfied if a forbidden fact is produced in one of the buries in one out of all the various lines of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.142" offset="5175986">The point in the favored purchaser's chain of distribution of which injury to competition is first felt is a concern only with respect to the factual question of causation not with respect to whether the statute has been violated as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.949" offset="5243173">And we feel that this Court should bring its Section 2 of the Clayton Act in harmony with its interpretations in the Van Camp decision prior to the passage of Robinson-Patman Act and in harmony with its uniform interpretations of similar language of the same language in Section 3 and 7 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.340" offset="5340766">Standard was a price leader and the principle supplier of gasoline in Pacific Northwest and Perkins was bound to purchase the vast bulk if not all of his gasoline from Standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.350" offset="5392802">It was a market dominated by the majors where the independents had been declining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.743" offset="5418297">In fact, Perkins was marketing 8% of Standard's gasoline and one-third of that market to which he was confined and during the claim period he lost 13% of his gallonage, he lost 50% of his fuel oil business which is tied to gasoline as the record shows, and Signal, the distributor, the independent distributor from Standard in whose favor the discrimination was granted, gained 50% during that claim period in gallonage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.615" offset="5585795">And as Perkins' expert witness, Dr. Mann testified in response to a hypothetical question covering the same record evidence, the foreseeable market trend in that area was toward increase concentration a decline of small business and a higher gasoline prices and he said this significant to leave which I doubly believe that in other words price discrimination and monopoly are Siamese twins.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.221" offset="5716302">And Perkins during this period for he went out of business constantly begged Standard for price assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.663" offset="5754023">It was only one month before Signal's present one on the stand they've been denying they were giving price assistance that they finally admitted a discrimination of $1 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.864" offset="5818807">And Perkins finally got some price assistance, it was a small amount and it amounted for all of his 60 stations to what standard gave one of its branded stations in a 75-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.261" offset="5900413">Signal was even able during the claim period to offer, to sell to Perkins gasoline at three-fourths of a gallon or on regular and eight-tenths on ethyl.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.222" offset="5956211">Although, Standard when faced with this denied that it was discriminating in favor of Signal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.518" offset="6005426">We submit on a basis of the forgoing that the jury could have found not only that a substantial lessening of competition was threatened but that as a substantial diminution in the vigor of competition had already in fact occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.735" offset="6066343">And thus, the jury's verdict was affordable on this basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.735" offset="6086301">We do not believe that it was the intention of the Congress in changing only a split infinity in correcting only a split infinity when it pass the Robinson-Patman amendment that it was the intent of Congress to weaken the Robinson-Patman amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.966" offset="6167280">This Court itself has said quite positively to the contrary in the Anheuser-Busch decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.094" offset="6207718">The legislative history and I quote the opinion of this Court, “the legislative history of these amendments leaves no doubt that the Congress was intent upon strengthening the Clayton Act provisions not weakening them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.799" offset="6278562">The Congress did not intend that that language of regarding competition injury to competition and a tendency toward monopoly should become mere surplusage with respect to the amended Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.896" offset="6362990">It conferred upon small business a less stringent remedy when it pass that Robinson-Patman amendment but it left the more stringent remedy to those like Perkins who are amply able with an ample record to prove the violation of the original standards of the Clayton Act Section 2.</text>

            <text syncTime="1599.496" offset="6501334">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.996" offset="6523382">I will address myself to the questions of causation and damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.454" offset="6549191">The first question is causation and the issue there is simply whether there was enough evidence before the jury from which it could reasonably infer that Perkins' destruction is an independent marketer of gasoline was approximately caused by the price discrimination in favor of Signal Oil and Gas Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.266" offset="6644485">Now, in the context of the Ninth Circuit's opinion in its reversal, the causation period in question which is important for the purpose of this case is a period from September of 1956 through December of 1957 and it involves in the beginning the Portland area in Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.230" offset="6736332">The parties the most important parties for Signal which was purchasing gasoline from Standard and Regal Stations Company which was marketing the gasoline in the Portland area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.151" offset="6783979">Western Hyway which was repurchasing from Signal was trucking the gasoline to and from that the Willbridge Terminal to the retail outlets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.924" offset="6827029">Now, the period as I pointed out is September 1956 through December 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.280" offset="6852524">Immediately prior to that time, none of the members of Signal's corporate family were in the Portland area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.125" offset="6883871">Signal was lifting no gasoline from Standard's Wilbert's terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.784" offset="6902471">Western Hyway was trucking no gasoline and there were no Regal retail outlets in Portland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.869" offset="6926817">In late August, Signal began its first lifting at Willbridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.024" offset="6947506">Regal opened its first station in Portland in September and Western at that time began to track the gasoline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.104" offset="6991809">Throughout the period, there was an admitted discrimination in price in favor of Signal Oil and Gas by Standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.168" offset="7028067">It wasn't always admitted or in fact it was hardly contested prior to the deposition of Signal's president but the day before that Standard admitted the discrimination and it's an admitted fact before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.035" offset="7091493">So, the price of gasoline was always lowered going into the Signal chain of distribution at wholesale and it always came out lower.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.336" offset="7128691">Regal consistently underpriced Perkins in the market throughout the period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.334" offset="7156694">Indeed, when Regal first opened its station, it dropped retail prices by four cents.</text>

            <text syncTime="2458.615" offset="9937795">Standard's terminal was in Willbridge which is in Portland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.312" offset="9952632">There was a price to Signal which lifted at Willbridge and it was at priced to Perkins which lifted at Willbridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.593" offset="9977710">The Perkins -- Standard, Perkins though had to transport his gasoline across the river because his stations were in the Vancouver area within the same trading area, within the same relevant market but across the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.618" offset="10037896">That cost him approximately three-tenths of a cent per gallon of gasoline and Standard gave him an allowance for that but Standard deducts its allowance from his price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.426" offset="10073109">We contend that since he had to pay to freight anyway, there should be no deduction from the price he paid Standard and therefore the prices should be equalized at the price in Willbridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.736" offset="10118353">But there's an additional factor on this as Mr. Kintner pointed out there was evidence in the record that Signal offered Perkins during this period a price which ranged from 75 one-hundredths of a cent to eight-tenths of a cent better than the price Standard offered Perkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.320" offset="10208632">And Standard at that time was supplying all of Signal's gasoline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.964" offset="10223261">Now, the jury could've inferred from that if you believe respondent's price discrimination figures that Signal was selling to Perkins at a loss and was willing to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.403" offset="10280939">Or the jury could've believe that Signal was going to make a profit on these sales which would've meant that they would've been getting a better price then either party have been able to demonstrate the upper limit of it would not be able to be determined on the record but the jury was certainly not bound to find that the prices are set forth in the schedules and the amounts of the differentials are set forth in the schedules where the only prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.519" offset="10389400">Beyond this, it's a very substantial -- it comes to be a lot of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.692" offset="10406118">Perkins sold over 20 million gallons of gasoline during the claim period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.130" offset="10419911">A half a cent per gallon would've been a $100,000.00 which should have made the substantial difference in his ability to remain viable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.847" offset="10462751">During the time, during this period, Standard was giving as I pointed out this lower price to Signal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.147" offset="10492008">Standard also was providing price assistance to its branded dealers who competed with Perkins at retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.655" offset="10521997">Now, the branded dealers were independent operators of Chevron and Signal stations, the Signal stations being independent of Signal Oil and Gas Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.757" offset="10558360">They were purchased from Signal Oil and Company by Standard in the late 40's were operated as a division of Standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.667" offset="10590020">Standard gave price assistance to those branded dealers both in Portland and located many miles distant from Portland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.486" offset="10621367">The result was that the market went down even further and stayed down precisely because Standard was the price leader in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.274" offset="10652505">There is testimony in the record that when Standard dropped his prices or raised its prices other companies could not alone remain at equilibrium.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.666" offset="10690017">They had to go that way as one Shell dealer testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.312" offset="10708616">It was the Signal brand the dealer that he looked to when there were two retailers under pricing him in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.733" offset="10734320">So this was a further depressing effect and it was one which caused the market to stay down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.140" offset="10755950">Now, the Ninth Circuit reviewed the facts underlying -- the Ninth Circuit reviewed the facts involved in most of this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.231" offset="10804328">The Ninth Circuit pointed out there was substantial evidence in the record that Regal cause the price worst, that those price were spread throughout the Pacific Northwest, and that Perkins had demonstrated that those price worst at harm did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.644" offset="10869948">In his business, it adversely affected him causing his ultimate destruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.739" offset="10894294">Now, petitioner was harmed in two ways, he lost customers and his sales declined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.951" offset="10927208">He was selling gasoline as a minor Standard would not permit him to testify and I would not permit him to advertise that he sold of major brand gasoline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.613" offset="10969840">The accepted major-minor differential was two cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.636" offset="10985932">At times during the period involved here, Mr. Perkins was unable to keep his price two cents below unless he was willing to absorb great losses, he ended up one cent below the majors, he ended up even with the brand of dealers at times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.331" offset="11056671">When he did that, he lost sales, when he maintained the differential he lost -- when he maintained the differential he lost profits on the sales he did make either way, he was cut.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.496" offset="11113305">Perkins went to Standard during the period and asked them for assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.542" offset="11133576">He said, he will be willing to take assistance at the wholesale level for the same type branded Signal and getting the same price or else he would appreciate getting some assistance comparable to that being received by the branded dealers at the retail level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.054" offset="11195538">Standard not only declined to give him the assistance, they denied that they have been giving price assistance to the branded dealers or that they had been discriminating him price in favor of Signal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.267" offset="11256456">As a result, Perkins received no help and he went out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.948" offset="11275160">Now, there was evidence before the jury and this is the evidence I referred to before is the evidence of passing on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.424" offset="11309119">There was evidence before the jury that Signal wanted a lower price from Standard precisely so that he could give that lower price to its customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.415" offset="11349034">The price didn't just happen, it was negotiated and it was negotiated at the behest of Signal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.691" offset="11374111">Signal had Standard in somewhat of a box because Standard was dependent on Signal's crude oil to run its refineries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.369" offset="11404831">So Signal kept insisting on a better price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.076" offset="11415698">During those negotiations, the Signal negotiator who was there marketing vice president pointed out that and he took the position that unless he had a lower price, he couldn't pass it on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.650" offset="11461987">After he got the lower price and after Regal entered the Portland area two Standard executives acknowledge that Regal had a better price than Perkins in the Pacific Northwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.656" offset="11514023">And they predicted that unless Standard did something to alleviate the situation, Regal would wreck that market and they were right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.800" offset="11546624">Standard also knew of Perkins' position, Perkins had told him and unless they held him not only was the market going to be wrecked but he was going to be driven out of business as he pointed he told them that he couldn't live under the existing arrangement and that too turned out to be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.260" offset="11612453">He went out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.537" offset="11621543">It is our feeling that this -- there was substantial evidence before the jury on which the jury could've based the finding that it was the price discrimination in favor of Signal supported by the price assistance to the branded dealers which approximately cost Perkins' destruction that the jury in short could've inferred the same causal connection which Standard executives have predicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.225" offset="11732302">The remaining issue was one of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.409" offset="11749021">The evidence that I have discussed on causation proves the requirement of legal harm, Perkins was injured, he went out of business, he lost sales and he lost profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.729" offset="11790294">And there was substantial evidence before the jury from which the jury could've inferred the amount by which he was injured which is the remaining requirement that he must meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.964" offset="11835225">His evidence of damage included his business records for the entire claim period, his purchase invoices for the claim period, his sales invoices with of his lost customers mainly distributors, it contain evidence of his declined in gallonage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.799" offset="11918608">It contained evidence that he could've increased the sales above what he was selling during the claim period without any additional cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.541" offset="11953507">The record contained evidence of the amount of gross profit Perkins was making during the claim period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.755" offset="11982346">Contained evidence of his expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.385" offset="11992900">It also contained evidence of the minimal gross profit necessary to survive as an independent jobber in the Pacific Northwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.054" offset="12023620">It contained evidence of the amount of the price differential and it contained the formula by which the jury could ascertain the going concern value of Perkins' operation where they defined that it had to go in concerned value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.486" offset="12089344">Now, the Ninth Circuit did not rule that there was not substantial evidence to support the jury verdict or left their -- the amount of the award was unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.228" offset="12144306">The Ninth Circuit ruled contrary to Perkins on one damage item.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.209" offset="12168234">It held that there had been evidence improperly admitted as evidence of damages and that this evidence was evidence of brokerage commissions which Perkins had not been paid by these corporations for getting them gasoline, an evidence of loss rentals from retail stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.988" offset="12247333">Now, a little bit of history is necessary to explain that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.195" offset="12260185">This was a lawsuit brought on behalf of Perkins as an individual and two corporations which he had formed to run his business in the 50's.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.933" offset="12291114">The evidence demonstrates the Standard never recognized the corporations and they dealt with Perkins independently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.945" offset="12323192">But when the lawsuit was filed, Standard insisted that the corporations bring the suit and there were assignments in the corporation suit in addition to Mr. Perkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.277" offset="12364466">In that context, Mr. Perkins has been trying to prove that he had standing to sue as an individual and that he had suffered legal harm introduced evidence of these items of -- these items of proof, the brokerage and the lost rentals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.993" offset="12423293">He introduced them to prove that he had standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.201" offset="12432175">That issue wasn't in the case anymore because the district judge charged the jury that Mr. Perkins was a purchaser from Standard and that is not contested but that is how it came in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.377" offset="12480867">Our answer to that point is that the evidence was not introduced, this evidence have damages that it was introduced as evidence of legal injury and that in any event it could not have misled the jury because it was not included in Perkins' damage computation exhibits nor was it included in the judge's detail charge on damages as one of the items which the jury might properly consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.050" offset="12579610">And just one final point, it is important, I think, that Standard argued this point at great length of the Ninth Circuit, the point at which the Ninth Circuit ruled at first in Perkins are damage question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.688" offset="12638124">But they don't say a word in defense of it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.631" offset="12649932">Here, they take a different attack and they suggest that there are many other errors which preclude reinstatement of the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.176" offset="12680025">We discussed those in our reply brief but it is our position that none of those errors, the errors which the Ninth Circuit didn't see fit to discuss are of any greater substance than the errors discussed in the reply brief and indeed, that our reading of the brief fails to disclose any significant differences between the issues raised in the brief and the issues in the specifications of errors more elaborate but essentially the same questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.442" offset="12809174">We respectfully submit that this Court should reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit and affirm the judgment of the District Court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard J. Maclaury</label>
            <text syncTime="3195.661" offset="12885974">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.065" offset="12907604">At the outset, we emphasize that this is not case of predatory or widespread discriminations aimed by Standard at eliminating a customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.079" offset="12963715">To the contrary, in the 1950's, petitioners and some four or five other jobbers were important customers of Standard in the Northwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.581" offset="13001644">These jobbers accounted were a large percentage of Standard's sales in that area, enabled Standard to gain access to a market, it could not otherwise reach and this was a market comprise of people who thinks they don't buy major brand gasoline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.109" offset="13075832">They prefer to purchase minor brand gasoline from the local dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.963" offset="13107179">In these circumstances, there was absolutely no commercial risk why Standard should wish to drive whether of its customers in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.911" offset="13155035">Predatory pricing after all is associated with the marketer who attempts to enhance his position in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.476" offset="13185233">But after all when Perkins terminated his contract with Standard, it was Union Oil Company of California gasoline that was sold through his stations not Standard's and certainly that was not a situation that Standard sought to instigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.892" offset="13254928">And similarly, it was not in Standard's interest to instigate widespread price loss which would cost the company vast sums of money by way of prices assistance to its dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.742" offset="13322324">This case involves three basic claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.454" offset="13341236">One is the discrimination in price of the gasoline to Signal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.864" offset="13366836">Two, the claim discriminations in the price of gasoline to Standard's branded dealers; and three, the Section 2 (e) and 2 (d) discriminations in favor of branded -- of Standard's branded dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.729" offset="13430262">Now, as to Signal, there are two claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.438" offset="13445099">Counsel so far I believe it mentioned only one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.995" offset="13459310">It was the claim in the Centralia-Seattle area and there was a claim in Portland-Vancouver area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.407" offset="13488985">The facts are that in 1955, Signal first purchased gasoline from Standard in Seattle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.716" offset="13526288">There, Perkins was buying gasoline but it was Union's gasoline which Perkins purchased through Westway and Perkins competed with Signal's customers Harris and others in Seattle but he competed with Westway gasoline or Union gasoline not Standard's gasoline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.489" offset="13617298">Now, some 80 miles to the south of Seattle there's a small town in Centralia and there Perkins had a customer named Carter and it was claimed that Signal reached out to one of its wholesalers and took this customer Carter away.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.896" offset="13682918">The facts are that neither Signal nor any of Signal's customers ever sold any gasoline in Centralia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.249" offset="13724400">Now, the second market involving Signal is Portland-Vancouver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.652" offset="13746030">Signal commenced buying from Standard, in Portland in August of 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.465" offset="13773197">Signal resold all of this gasoline to Western Hyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.087" offset="13795767">Signal by the way had absolutely no stock with ownership connection with Standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.750" offset="13818337">Western Hyway was owned 60% by Signal and the remaining of the stock was owned by Western's corporate officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.122" offset="13863894">Western sold all of this gasoline except for a minor amount which is not pertinent to this lawsuit, the three Regal stations in Portland.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.603" offset="13909765">Those Regal stations were owned 55% of the stock by Western and the remainder by persons having no connection with Western.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.233" offset="13952293">The important fact is that when Regal opened the business in Portland in September, Signal was paying Standard a higher price for gasoline then Perkins was paying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.835" offset="14018748">And at all times in this lawsuit from September from 1956 until June of 1957 the price paid by Western Hyway, Regal supplier the gasoline was higher than the price paid by Regal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.456" offset="14093145">I say that was until June of 1957.</text>

            <text syncTime="3503.654" offset="14118013">The price paid by Regal, excuse me, when I said that I misspoke myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.864" offset="14142777">The price paid by Western Hyway Regal supplier for gasoline was higher than the price paid by Perkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.373" offset="14180916">There was no evidence in this case of the price paid by Regal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.613" offset="14221876">After November 1, 1957, Western's price was some 35 ten-thousandths of a cent higher than the price paid by Perkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.872" offset="14282898">So the summary on Signal is that Signal never sold to a retailer and Signal never sold through its wholesaler or directly to anyone in Centralia.</text>

            <text syncTime="3831.585" offset="15429674">But this Court rejected that concept of competition and said specifically that despite the broader term distribution used in Section 2 (d) which is broader term than the term resale in 2 (a), the Congress did not intend the word “competition” as used in the Robinson-Patman Act would have that broad meaning.</text>

            <text syncTime="4961.785" offset="19950529">Our point here is that this standard was presented to the jury in the alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="4969.975" offset="19983235">Certainly, the standard of the Robinson-Patman Act provisions was more or less onerous burden in the standard of the original Clayton Act and one would expect that the -- having a choice the jury would make the decision in -- on a basis of the -- or simplified unless onerous Robinson-Patman amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="4995.416" offset="20085008">But before the Court of Appeals, our objection here to raising this problem here is not a technical one.</text>

            <text syncTime="5047.889" offset="20294928">So, I don't disagree with the proposition of law but my only suggestion is that this Court has before it the abstract question of whether or not the standard of the original Clayton Act is limited to the fourth level or to the third level or to the second level.</text>
            <text syncTime="5071.367" offset="20388864">The answer to that is no, Van Camp settled that and there isn't a record here that would support a holding that the original Clayton Act should apply here in this case.</text>
