            <text syncTime="19.872" offset="183860">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.654" offset="199011">We have before us case arising in the State of Ohio under a conviction under Ohio's Criminal Syndicalism Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.726" offset="231299">We have indeed before us something of rarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.007" offset="244464">It is as far as I know a third case ever tried under Ohio's Criminal Syndicalism Act and the first to ever reach the appellate level.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.448" offset="286156">I -- there was earlier in Ohio when their peculiar proceedings in which a prosecutor could bring a proceeding before the Supreme Court on appeal for a question of law only.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.200" offset="345192">A proceeding in which -- a motion was made in the lower court in Ohio, attacking the constitutionality of Ohio's Criminal Syndicalism Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.827" offset="383749">The lower court in Ohio held the law to be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.763" offset="399423">It was appealed to the Supreme Court in State versus Kassay and in what is basically in advisory opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.194" offset="433173">The Court stated that it was constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.589" offset="446757">If the Court also stated several engaging other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.152" offset="460967">It stated that the First Amendment did not apply to the states of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.546" offset="482597">It also stated that the measure of its application was an issue in its constitutionality and it would attend the first trial of a case to see what is the proper measure of its application.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.616" offset="554904">The Court waited patiently for the first application to a case that arose some 40 years later in this case and surprisingly despite the invitation here sent out in Kassay, the Court declined to even hear his constitutional question on the application in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.138" offset="632957">It in fact defaulted to this Court, Ohio's privilege are setting forth the limitations of the application of its statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.960" offset="648213">Ohio's privileges are setting forth potentiality of clarification and delineation of a statute which obviously on its face rushes head long into the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.150" offset="721042">These are the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.074" offset="740686">A television reporter receives a telephone call indicating that if he wanted to he could come and take movies of a Ku Klux Klan meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.535" offset="778512">He came.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.311" offset="785617">He met some hooded figures and arrangements were made for the taking of a movie.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.996" offset="808396">A movie was taken in which a cross was burned, some figures milled about, and yelled some stupid and rather, a senseless slogans and then a single figure was panned on, and he made a speech, a speech full of conditions, precedents, and reservations, hyperbola self-evidently stupid and silly.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.176" offset="917065">The --he asserted that the clan was the largest organization in the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.504" offset="946427">He then went on in a -- with a condition precedent that if the various branch is the Government including this Court, do not mend their ways that revengeance, a word of his own coining I assume would be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.334" offset="1013718">He did not specify the revengeance and we do not know what particular aspect of the democratic process he was going to involve himself in revengeance.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.308" offset="1057604">He then spoke of a March not in identifying it as an armed march or any sort of march of any force or violence into Washington and then into two southern states, incidentally, raising federal questions perhaps rather than internal state questions.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="allen_brown" startTime="267.020" stopTime="525.002">
            <label>Mr. Allen Brown</label>
            <text syncTime="267.020" offset="1172438">In both films.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.386" offset="1177976">There were guns.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.804" offset="1191664">It is also to be noted that the film was taken on a remote, private farm in which apparently there is no evidence whatsoever that these people were not invitees present on that farm by authority of the ownership of the farm.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.401" offset="1254045">There was nothing, nothing adduce an indictment was returned, I have to some preliminary move, maneuvering including a frontal attack on the constitutionality of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.043" offset="1308588">The case came on to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.379" offset="1317888">The state produced nothing but the film in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.130" offset="1336905">The only other evidence that the state produced was basically geared to identifying the personnel involved in the film.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.252" offset="1381418">In other words, showing that the man Brandenburg had a gun similar to the guns in the film and that he had markings on his person similar to the markings and that his voice was similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.145" offset="1437006">Other than this, the state offered nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.672" offset="1451112">It is critical that the state offered nothing on the nature and history of the Klan.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.730" offset="1487266">It offered nothing showing that the course of the Klan's history any continuing historical or expert opinions concerning any possible commitment to violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.572" offset="1534704">It offered nothing on the continuing organization of the Klan, nothing whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.879" offset="1563961">It offered nothing other than the film itself and the words intrinsic in the film itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.341" offset="1593741">The state then rests the defense in which I was not involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.238" offset="1609310">I'm appoint of counsel -- appointed for purposes of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.570" offset="1626655">Made a motion for dismissal at that time, I will frankly admit that the motion for dismissal which was made by then counsel was simply our weight of evidence motion and he did not specifically denote the constitutional question that had arisen at that point in the presentation of the state's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.636" offset="1702933">I suggest that it is completely immaterial but he did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.841" offset="1719756">The defense then preceded forward and offered basically a defense of the positive testimony in which various members -- officers of the Klan testified as to their ostensible peaceful purposes and things of this sort and the historical evaluations of the presence of weapons and the burning of a cross.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.813" offset="1839606">The Court then charged the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.062" offset="1856637">The Court's charged the jury and I specifically asked this Court to consider it carefully.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.969" offset="1884223">Begins in the appendix at page 72 and met with the statute that thrust itself clearly within the First Amendment makes on its face no attempt to give us a life indication of a line demarcation between the mere abstract teaching in advocacy or even advocacy in relation to a clear and present danger as to advocacy in a hypothetical sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.351" offset="2005849">That in no way on its face does this.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.899" offset="2015984">The Court perpetuated the evil of the statute by making the charge even more general, in which he indeed define the term advocacy as involving intrinsic in it in his own charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.100" offset="2084843">Teaching, so that we have at this point a man who had been tried with none of the safeguards of the First Amendment applied to the trial of his cause to the measure of his evidence or to the instructions to those who worked to be the triers of the fact which would demarcate the point at which the First Amendment would be operative in relation to what happen on that isolated farm on that isolated day.</text>

            <text syncTime="1612.634" offset="6554917">The Court's permission as I take it basically there are two points involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.485" offset="6590339">One, is the Ohio Statute on Criminal Syndicalism and two, the evidence that was presented to a judge and jury upon which a finding and verdict of guilty was returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.123" offset="6656899">Now, counsel, I believe that the Ohio Criminal Syndicalism law is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.922" offset="6692112">I have cited various authorities relative to my beliefs in this matter in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.605" offset="6726802">I believe that the basic matter before this Court is the application of the evidence as was presented to the jury to determine whether or not there was sufficient evidence upon which a jury could return a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.957" offset="6804229">I believe that in this case when counsel says sending the Jews back to Israel, let's give them back to the dark garden that this might not involved violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.865" offset="6871834">I would like him perhaps in his reply to explain how the statement, “Bury the niggers” would not constitute a violent form of actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.112" offset="6932856">Now in this case, there is two basic parts of the film.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.405" offset="6954068">One, that was taken inside of a room in which the defendant Clarence Brandenburg was identified and I don't believe there is any question or any in the record either between the appellant and the appellee in this matter relative to his identification as he being the person saying, this is an organizer's meeting we have had quite a few members here today which are we have had hundred -- hundreds of members throughout the state and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.860" offset="7055841">Then there is a second portion of the film in which a group of people are walking or marching around a burning cross, hooded, armed, shouting profanities in which there is a question whether or not the defendant himself said the words as attributed to him in the transcript and on page 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.938" offset="7148105">“How far is the nigger going to -- yeah.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.778" offset="7159495">“Send the Jews back to Israel” and so forth with the other profanities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.479" offset="7182273">There is some evidence in the transcript itself which could indicate as a jury sitting and listening in that the defendant himself made one or more of these statements, and I apologize to the Court for not having this as part of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.199" offset="7261163">I notified counsel of the possibility of my bringing this matter up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.420" offset="7278090">Ohio has a section in its code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.668" offset="7287077">Ohio Revised Code Section 1.17 which provides, whoever aids, abets, or procures another to commit an offense may be prosecuted as if he were the principal offender.</text>

            <text syncTime="3077.650" offset="12415018">To win my case, Justice Fortas, may I submit that the State of Ohio as just as this moment indicated the massive invasion into the First Amendment that we have here into when Mr. Kirschner suggested that I could run down through Harlem saying, “Kill the Negroes” and Justice Marshall responded, “You wouldn't last very long.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.418" offset="12530061">That Justice Marshall who is safe for the moment because the venue is in Washington D.C. but in Ohio could be indicted for suggesting a violent reaction by the Negro community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.228" offset="12585336">This is the state of invasion under this statute into the First Amendment rights because under the proposition that Mr. Kirschner outlined here legally that is precisely the effect of Justice Marshall's remark.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.320" offset="12645627">I suggest further that we have this unusual situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.985" offset="12664330">We have such a deep-seated invasion the First Amendment rights that we get in meshed in difficulties of Mr. Kirschner outlines when he says there was no objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.613" offset="12742802">Incidentally, I was not counsel of record and I have never at this point because I feel certain professional loyalties raised the question of competency of counsel in the original trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.093" offset="12784807">But assuming Mr. Kirschner's reasoning what he has stated here is that the Supreme Court would have stated the record before it, was saying in effect that a constitutional issue is a mere error of omission and it is further saying that the instructions that you have before you to read are the dimensions that Ohio sets upon this statutes invasion of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.642" offset="12910926">And I suggest that if that is the state of the record, that perhaps my earlier response to you Justice Brennan is not correct and perhaps, we must then reach the statute and declare it unconstitutional.</text>
