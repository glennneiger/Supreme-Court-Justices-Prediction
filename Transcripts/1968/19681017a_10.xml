            <label>Mr. James M. Marsh</label>
            <text syncTime="38.410" offset="257024">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.679" offset="262040">This is an appeal from the Supreme Court of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.746" offset="274369">It presents a single clear issue of constitutional law, which is whether or not a state can permit its municipalities to tax certain property used within New Jersey by a foreign, nonprofit corporation which has qualified and based in New Jersey, and at the same time, permit them to exempt from taxation same type of property when used by a New Jersey nonprofit corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.457" offset="381158">We believe of course that is denial of equal protection as that term is now applied by this Court over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.593" offset="417729">Now the appellant here WHYY was one brought under Pennsylvania law in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.659" offset="441971">It's also license by the Federal Communications Commission for the transmission of noncommercial radio and TV programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.769" offset="474467">It is subject to great many restrictions by both the state and the FCC.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.510" offset="493380">It is not permitted to sell time, it is not permitted to accept advertising, it cannot engage in any activity which inures profit to any corporation or person, it's not permitted to pay dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.669" offset="537997">The property involved in this case is the only property which, WHYY has in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.086" offset="559731">As a site where there is a tower for transmission of television programs on the Channel 12, the site must be personally involved is what lead to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.416" offset="609050">All the programs in WHYY from Channel 12 are educational, cultural or recreational.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.546" offset="637576">They broadcast daily for the benefit of schools in a number of school district in the three or four states involved including a number in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.525" offset="673520">They have other programs in evenings and on Saturdays.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.561" offset="689612">The population of the area reached by Channel 12 was about 8 million people and the record shows that about 29.5% are located in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.686" offset="726079">Now at pages 47 to 67 there is a detailed statement as to a nature WHYY activities, his background and the restrictions imposed upon, this was put in the record of the request on the Supreme Court of New Jersey before argument in that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.967" offset="795251">In the last two pages list programs which were geared strictly to New Jersey people with -- to show the court what benefits were confertly in census in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.086" offset="839764">That statement also shows that WHYY has supported completely by grants and donations from the federal state and local governments, by appellant from school district, by grants from foundations, by donations from corporations and by general public, all these donations are tax deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.132" offset="911862">The grantors of WHYY who are unpaid they are either public officials in the states involved where they are civic leaders.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.665" offset="950000">WHYY is exempt from federal state and local tax as except to this particularly tax and a few tax they paid because they were de minimis.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.465" offset="989184">Now all the broadcast and all the services performed by WHYY are supported by the source that I mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.117" offset="1015829">They have no sales of advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.843" offset="1022725">They have no commercials.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.160" offset="1028054">This is a -- which you might call 100% two-way charity operation, everything is given to WHYY for nothing and everything we do is done for nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.551" offset="1065566">And on this circumstance it's obvious that it is very important that we receive every proper economic advantage so that this station can survive.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.964" offset="1099212">Tax involved in this case are substantial, excuse me, at least they are substantial to WHYY.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.716" offset="1138186">The assessed valuation of the property which the state seeks to tax is $113,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.241" offset="1160338">There are four years involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.903" offset="1170996">This case involved only 1964 but this result will govern 1965, 1966, and 1967.</text>

            <text syncTime="289.620" offset="1261902">And during the course of this case, the New Jersey legislature amended that statute to grant this exemption to non-profit educational television station.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.750" offset="1294399">So for 1968 on, we have no problem but we do have this problem with these four years and they're substantial amount of money.</text>

            <text syncTime="304.918" offset="1323029">You have no quarrel with this amended statute.</text>

          <turn speaker="james_m_marsh" startTime="309.049" stopTime="517.197">
            <label>Mr. James M. Marsh</label>
            <text syncTime="309.049" offset="1339538">No sir, we're happy with the amended statute and we were saying we have it retroactive or take some other remedial action but strictly prospect on operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.235" offset="1376319">Now in New Jersey we run the gambit of the administrative proceedings that time strictly on the ground that WHYY having been domesticated was in a fact that domestic corporation had other language in the statute could be grant this exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.221" offset="1436296">The New Jersey administrative officials didn't see it that way in order the Supreme Court in New Jersey and they went solely in that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.987" offset="1463359">The federal postures issue was not raised until the case in the Supreme Court in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.803" offset="1482585">That court then asked for the statement, which I mentioned which is at pages 47 to 67 at the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.763" offset="1502438">So they have a full background to make their judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.778" offset="1514454">Unfortunately, when they made their judgment on equal protection argument, they made it very summarily and very abruptly.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.067" offset="1535666">They did not discuss or distinguished any of the cases in this Court up to that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.639" offset="1553951">They simply said that there is a presumption of validity of a statute and they indicated -- they believe there is a possibility of different treatment of foreign nonprofit corporations and local domestic nonprofit corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.754" offset="1610376">Now we feel this is clearly wrong under the case this court which we are citing could starting with Southern Railway, where this Court said that a division of corporations entered domestic and foreign for purposes of taxation, taxing the foreign and not taxing the domestic on the same property and in the same operation is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.253" offset="1688430">And this Court has said many times that once a corporation has been admitted is entitled the exactly the same treatment as every other corporation in the same class within a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.278" offset="1724479">Now the idea was the New Jersey Supreme Court expressed that faced with a discriminatory statute, a court can say well the legislature had some basis where it could have had some basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.452" offset="1773171">You could imagine the basis in which they would make a finding that there will be some reason for not taxing domestic corporations and taxing foreign as also disowned by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.998" offset="1819355">As long ago as the Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe case in 165 U.S. where Mr. Justice Stewart said that “To so treat the Due Process and Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment would make a mere rope of sand out of those clause and would afford no protection against state action.”</text>
            <text syncTime="446.673" offset="1890095">I would think they say an apt description of what happened and in this case and addition to that the question is whether or not to accept a particular group of taxpayers or group of corporations from taxation is the legislative function.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.156" offset="1944012">The New Jersey legislature made this judgment and that statute which was set forth on page 26 of the record, page 26 of our brief rather and pages 14 and 15 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.003" offset="1983404">That statute provides that a nonprofit at a foreign corporation of any kind can qualify New Jersey and get a certificate telling it to offer in New Jersey simply by following certain information about its composition, its capital and nature of its activities, and find certain documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.965" offset="2047248">The WHYY did this and it's our view that the state Supreme Court cannot now retroactively in effect to kind of take back that certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.445" offset="2081102">Because they have a thing that have more day have been requested perhaps the legislature would have come to a different conclusion what they have done is kind of dream up a phantom session of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.781" offset="2126451">And said “Well these faults probably could have found some basis and if they could have why then, they would have” and we have a right to say, “You have no right to complain.”</text>

            <text syncTime="747.834" offset="3094758">Well, they have entered their appearance for the State of New Jersey but they've only entered a statement in lieu of a brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.978" offset="3131329">And appeared that none of hearings to argue is a matter and throughout all the record you'll see that the Deputy Attorney General's name is listed there but never appeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.286" offset="3176469">This is one of the problems faced in this matters that the State of New Jersey of course receives and none of this taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.033" offset="3207502">This is a law of course passed by the New Jersey legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.039" offset="3227564">Where the tax situation as I'm sure you're aware of in New Jersey it's for the local, a local purpose for the fire protection and police protection for the local municipalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.530" offset="3269465">None of this money ever inures to the State of New Jersey and since the Borough of Glassboro the one interested in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.001" offset="3303424">We of course carried the ball through the fight and the upholding the state statute on this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.692" offset="3334144">Now the -- in addition to the facts that were set forth by the appellant I'd like to add that the Channel 12, WHYY never applied for an exemption under the statute 54:4-4.4.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.432" offset="3409063">This was not handled in the New Jersey Supreme Court because they felt they didn't have to handle that they've upheld the statute so therefore they did not consider this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.827" offset="3450650">The reason this may be very important is that the procedure is set forth where a form is filled out for the tax assessor to review the statements by someone claiming the exemption and why they should be exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.183" offset="3504149">The record is clear that the Borough was put on noticed, a letter was sent by this attorney for the television station asking for an exemption, which was referred to the local solicitor who then referred to the states statute and says, you're not exempt because under the New Jersey statute which is set forth in the appendix on page 17 the Section which excluded them of course and which was the argument I might say all through the New Jersey courts up into the Supreme Court that the foregoing exemptions shall apply only when the association, corporation or institution claiming the exemption owns the property in question that is incorporated, were organized under the laws of this state, and authorized to carry out the purposes on account of which the exemption is claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.287" offset="3700485">We agree that this Channel 12 is a nonprofit corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.494" offset="3717308">There's no question that they comply in every way with what New Jersey would consider a nonprofit corporation that is not our argument today.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.701" offset="3750222">The situation is that the Borough of Glassboro has filed the law in New Jersey by denying this exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.476" offset="3777285">We had to list this over a hundred thousand dollars of ratables both real and personal on our books.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.568" offset="3805602">The local citizens had to pay these taxes because we have the county government that relies on what you access on your local municipalities to run the county government in Gloucester County which Glassboro situate.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.066" offset="3855653">Now they have been paying these taxes and they have to make up this deficit every year, which now amounts to a sum of $60,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.461" offset="3885223">It is true we are only arguing back taxes now.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.323" offset="3896613">The new Act that became effective January 1, 1968 and I might say the same question was raised by the New Jersey Supreme Court whether this was a -- an Act to clarify the existing law or was it a modification to carry on after January 1st.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.941" offset="3967143">And I might only add that the law firm that was handling the matter in the state level was from a law firm where the Senators sponsored the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.419" offset="4009044">So I think it's safe to say that it was not a declaratory act but it was an act to amend 54:4-3.6 and to carry on after 1st of January.</text>

            <text syncTime="1003.169" offset="4116041">It just includes them in there domestic or foreign corporations are included in the exemption of the section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.326" offset="4152717">Down at it's -- the taxes as I said amount to approximately $60,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.425" offset="4177063">I would like to address myself to the procedural point here that the fact that the federal issue was never raised in this matter to all the Supreme Court in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.801" offset="4214575">And it might not have been raised then, had it not been for the fact that the appellate division of the superior court was unanimous in upholding the statute as it was argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.023" offset="4251460">Because it was argued that by Channel 12 that they are organized under the laws of New Jersey because they qualified -- because they had a registered agent in the state that could be served, service of process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.795" offset="4306526">So therefore, they were “organized”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.351" offset="4316766">Of course, the word “organized” as shown in the opinions of the superior court appellate division and the state Supreme Court, New Jersey State Supreme Court meant that it dealt with organizations such as religious organizations that are not incorporated but nevertheless are organized in New Jersey and are available for the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.027" offset="4395447">This is the argument that prevailed to the Supreme Court then the appellant in this matter was faced with a problem on how to get into the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.052" offset="4431600">Because there was no dissent in the appellate division and no constitutional issue raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.457" offset="4449155">It then for the first time raised the issue of equal protection of laws under the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1124.536" offset="4601501">The New Jersey Supreme Court when faced with this problem simply stated as it's outlined on page 9 of the appendix, this Court may not need -- this Court may but need not accept the constitutional question not raise below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.007" offset="4675375">As this constitutional contention is one of the great concern to many municipalities and nonprofit foreign corporations the public interest in this question demands that it would be decided.</text>

            <text syncTime="2034.917" offset="8243075">I don't think unless there was a complaint lies against someone that was circumventing the nonprofit status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.887" offset="8270869">New Jersey wouldn't be concerned because the taxing problem is a local one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.536" offset="8289468">So the local tax assessor must review the situation to make sure that they are fulfilling this status and there is a provision wherever here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.870" offset="8326875">They're supposed to re-file to show that their activities do continue to be nonprofit, so they are entitled to the exemptions as set forth in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.458" offset="8365223">I would like to reserve anytime remaining to any rebuttal for Mr. Marsh.</text>

            <text syncTime="2070.547" offset="8385599">I think the order of our argument is that you complete you're argument now, and Mr. Marsh then conclude his.</text>

            <text syncTime="2078.714" offset="8418200">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.358" offset="8432828">A case was alluded to in the appellant's brief the Board of Education of Kentucky versus Illinois case which was, is the only case involved in the appellant's brief with nonprofit corporations as of situation where a state did discriminate on it's taxing, on a taxing basis for a nonprofit corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.465" offset="8537213">And it was upheld and that the basis being that this money was going to be used -- have to be used exclusively in the State of Kentucky therefore Illinois would not receive any benefits from it and therefore could tax it on it, it was an inheritance tax, I believe in that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.769" offset="8622477">Now it can be differentiated in the fact that the WHYY is claiming that they do some benefits for the State of New Jersey in Southern New Jersey with their transmitter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.919" offset="8679006">The problem of rebutting the voluminous information that was supplied was that this information was supplied just prior to argument before the New Jersey Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.264" offset="8724459">This question apparently came up in their mind “What benefits does New Jersey receive from your Channel 12?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.913" offset="8751000">And this was supplied as an outline in their appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.204" offset="8768240">However, I don't think it would be outlined at an extension of that rule of the Illinois case could be applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.281" offset="8808469">And that the discrimination that New Jersey is attempting or this alleged discrimination is not that far and unfair to the local residence of Glassboro that that rule could be extended to this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.451" offset="8877223">That they should incorporate in the State of New Jersey so that the Glassboro wouldn't have taxed them and then be bound in the situation they find themselves today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.490" offset="8913377">And the case cited that Railway Express Agency versus Virginia were Justice Holmes wrote the opinion in that where they forced a foreign corporation to incorporate to do any business in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.321" offset="8972622">And this was held not to be unreasonable and if they want to do business in the state they should incorporate and this was upheld.</text>

            <label>Mr. James M. Marsh</label>
            <text syncTime="2230.153" offset="9024031">Just to clarify a few matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.048" offset="9031555">First, Mr. Justice Brennan's problems about the Attorney General, I think it may be explained by raising the facts that during this litigation and up to today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.949" offset="9067186">The Attorney General of New Jersey is the member of the Board of WHYY which might have made this participation a little awkward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.367" offset="9112848">The other problem about the statue, the statute we talked about was passed after decision of the Superior Court of New Jersey but before the decision of the Supreme Court in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.813" offset="9154644">So it was, I supposed you say was repealed or the decision of the Supreme Court in New Jersey but it had no bearing on the --</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2272.052" offset="9191528">Well, i thought you say Mr. Marsh that the new statute had no retroactive application that's why you didn't --</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="2282.817" offset="9234683">Intervene in the Superior Court and the Supreme Court?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_m_marsh" startTime="2285.000" stopTime="2391.532">
            <label>Mr. James M. Marsh</label>
            <text syncTime="2285.000" offset="9243355">Yes, it intervened between any Superior Court's decision and the Supreme Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.267" offset="9256417">So the Supreme Court had nothing to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.317" offset="9268642">As far as the statement that we should have been required to incorporate in New Jersey and New Jersey legislature carry that they don't make any sense in provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.974" offset="9307303">And we have comply with all the laws and all the regulations I did put down and we feel we have fully qualified for all the rights approach that nonprofit corporations have in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.776" offset="9350457">This is also the sense between the Kentucky case which I myself went out to the court in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.705" offset="9370206">Because in that case you had it questioned -- a Kentucky corporation which had not qualified in Illinois, which could not possibly spend any money in Illinois couldn't get any benefits to people of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.570" offset="9405628">And Illinois said rightly, I think that they didn't have to give them this inheritance free of tax like its quite duly case in every possible respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.036" offset="9443558">The only other question I want to talk to you on is the question of the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.961" offset="9459231">First of all the requirement that you applied for this exemption is not in this exemption section it's in another quite general section of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.341" offset="9488697">Secondly, the duty raise is place on the assessor not on a taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.196" offset="9508133">Thirdly, there was substantial compliance in that and we didn't like a request on November 7, 1963 I supposed to November 1st, which would be the date of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.486" offset="9545331">And the final thing, probably the most significant thing, is the Supreme Court in New Jersey did not decide the case on that ground and now had they thought much of it, it's the same scenario it would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.562" offset="9585664">Because they could have avoided it deciding in federal constitution issue by just simply telling us whatever your rights where you gave them up, they didn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.276" offset="9612518">I guess that's very significant and I submit that we have comply well in the laws in New Jersey and required to be treated as a New Jersey corporation for this purpose and otherwise would be a protection, with this the judgment should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.520" offset="9661419">Thank you very much.</text>
