            <text syncTime="56.445" offset="330146">This case involves the constitutionality of the Arkansas anti-evolution law.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.568" offset="374659">Mrs. Susan Epperson, a teacher an H.H. Blanchard, the father of two would be learners challenged the constitutionality of the Initiated Act number 1 of 1926, which was the so-called monkey bill of the anti-evolution law.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.970" offset="480298">A challenge was based upon the contention that the Act violated and collided with the First Amendment freedoms to freedom of speech, the freedom to teach and to learn, the freedom and the question of freedom of religion, the question of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.037" offset="580504">We have briefed these points as well as we possibly can.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.437" offset="606104">We have the benefit of supporting briefs of amicus to excellent briefs and I shall not burden or impose upon the time of the patient of this Court to argue to any great extent the question of the First Amendment Freedom is what I would like to discuss with emphasis -- greater emphasis that in our brief, the question of the vagueness of the Act that is the failure of the Act to meet the permissible statutory vagueness of the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.195" offset="749150">From the time that this Act was enacted or adopted, teachers were in Arkansas were in -- have been and are genuinely confused and concerned, uncertain as to whether or not the language of the Act which forbid the teacher to teach the theory or doctrine that man ascended or descended from a lower form of animals.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.316" offset="865656">Whether that language forbid the teacher to discuss the matter or permit the theory or permit a classroom from discussion of the theory or whether the actual meaning of the Act was that the teacher could not teach that the theory was -- had been established or it was true.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.697" offset="951233">Now, at the time of the trial of this case and the lower court, the plaintiff Mrs. Epperson testified that she did not wish to teach that the theory was true but simply to explain it because it was contained in a chapter in the Biology of book that had been furnished to her by the Local School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.356" offset="1053842">May I say that in my -- as I understand it, there is simply is no Biology textbook that does not have some references or some explanation of the theory of the evolution of man.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.712" offset="1111207">Judge Reed, the trial judge committed on the question of whether or not the language of the Act permitted a discussion of the Act of whether it forbid the teaching of the, that the theory was true.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.552" offset="1174632">We devoted 12 pages in our brief and the Arkansas Supreme Court to a discussion of statutory vagueness under the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.768" offset="1215488">It -- the Supreme Court of Arkansas in a two line opinion, memorandum opinion held that this was a proper exercise or valid exercise, this Act was a valid exercise of the power of state to control the curriculum of the schools.</text>
