            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 44, William Skinner et al., petitioner versus Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.579" offset="193703">Mr. Leppert.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="george_m_leppert" startTime="24.119" stopTime="216.462">
            <label>Mr. George M. Leppert</label>
            <text syncTime="24.119" offset="199868">Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors and Associate Justices.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.652" offset="229961">I represent the three petitioners in this case, who were convicted in a marijuana prosecution at which petitioner Skinner received 10 years, Gueldner 16 years, and Chauvenet, the Negro defendant received 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.318" offset="316688">Although we're relying upon strictly legal issues here, it is necessary to present to you some of the highlights in the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.622" offset="361827">Mr. Skinner who received 10 years was never shown to have been a user or an addict or a vendor or pusher of narcotics in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.449" offset="409161">He engaged in a -- he was successfully engaged in two second-hand automobile places in New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.803" offset="438627">And it was admitted by the narcotics agents that they undertook initially to make a case against one of his employees, they were not after Skinner at all, and failing in that apparently, it made a case against him along with Gueldner, his salesman and Chauvenet who was alleged to be the pusher.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.024" offset="527444">Now, the indictment, the information charged a single transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.793" offset="554506">There were two counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.306" offset="564642">On May 21, 1965, a sale of about $10.00 with marijuana cigarettes in possession of the same cigarettes.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.372" offset="604871">The manner in which Skinner became involved in this is set forth clearly in the preliminary hearing and in the trial on the merits, all of which is referred to in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.835" offset="650742">It amounted to a plea of entrapment but we're not urging that because that's factual issue but it is necessary to understand what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.407" offset="685014">The undercover agent Fullington had gotten as a cover job, a position of a financing manager of a company which had the yes or no on loans used by Mr. Skinner in his business.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.318" offset="740603">He ingratiates himself with Mr. Skinner.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.326" offset="752724">He went out to the race track with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.567" offset="761605">He let him put up money for the bets.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.756" offset="774353">He let him make dates with him with women and then finally when he gotten that far into his confidence, he informed him that he wanted to get some marijuana for a friend of his.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.760" offset="818448">And it was set up according to the state's testimony for it to be delivered on the night of May the 21st at which time the allegedly took place on the lot on Skinner's lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.263" offset="876440">Then under Louisiana system evidence which is very broad, the state was allowed to bring in quite another transaction on May 28 involving another portion $13.00 worth of marijuana which allegedly took place on the same lot through a meeting with Chauvenet set up in the same way.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="216.462" stopTime="217.758">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="216.462" offset="969226">Between the same parties?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="george_m_leppert" startTime="217.758" stopTime="714.988">
            <label>Mr. George M. Leppert</label>
            <text syncTime="217.758" offset="974451">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.640" offset="977899">Now, under the Louisiana system of evidence which I say is the broadest in the country, they were also permitted to bring in another transaction which neither Skinner nor Gueldner had in connection with and which the agent said that after he got the second marijuana, he told Chauvenet he wanted to get some heroin and he says that Chauvenet on that same day went somewhere else in other part of the city and got some heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.231" offset="1088345">So there was -- on that original deal that was engrafted, these other two transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.169" offset="1112064">One of which two defendants the same, were the same and one of which that had no connection well except the fact that it started on the automobile lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.489" offset="1153337">Now, we won this case originally by vote of five to two in the State Supreme Court on the theory that the Court had erroneously given a full blown conspiracy charge whereas none was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.777" offset="1206523">There was a separate conspiracy case turning and we contended that the lower Court, the trial Court had become confused and went further than saying that admission of evidence of one conspirator statements could be used against the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.021" offset="1259499">But he gave a full blown partnership theory of conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.062" offset="1275591">We won it five to two and on a rehearing, they reversed themselves and ruled six to one against us and then denied all the other bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.455" offset="1317177">I'm not pressing that point now because I believe that that procedure was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.568" offset="1337657">I have not abandoned it in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.727" offset="1346330">I believe that the two errors are more of greater national interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.719" offset="1370258">And we come therefore to the main point, two points which we urge here.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.033" offset="1391470">The defendant Chauvenet, this indigent Negro, 33 years old was arrested and he had a series of court-appointed counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.291" offset="1432534">He had three counsels appointed before my associate, Mr. Link finally got into the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.520" offset="1457403">He stayed in jail a nearly a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.515" offset="1469419">He had a bail bond of $50,000.00 and nobody did anything for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.772" offset="1490422">Now, it is misleading to state as the state does that none of these three counsels did anything because of illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.604" offset="1517798">The only thing about illness of previous counsel is that passing reference in a motion which indicates that at some time, one of them was ill but there's no evidence about any continued illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.545" offset="1561579">There's certainly no suggestion that all three of them were ill for a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.644" offset="1573909">Nobody did anything for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.630" offset="1585925">Finally, after the case, after the -- while he was still in jail, and while he had no notice of anything that was going on, as far as there were, not even notice of any hearing, there were extensive hearings filed on behalf of our clients, that is Mr. Gill, for whom I have loss because he tried the case for Chauvenet and Gueldner.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.339" offset="1676727">And Mr. Link finally tried it for Chauvenet.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.461" offset="1701177">I mean, we represent Skinner and Gueldner and he represent Chauvenet.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.003" offset="1711417">Excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.014" offset="1727404">There was a motion for preliminary examination, a motion to quash, a motion to suppress and motion on bill of particulars.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.163" offset="1763976">As we note in our brief, there was some 40 odd pages of testimony taken on which went right to the vitals of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.356" offset="1800756">Now, under the Louisiana system, as to these preliminary hearings, the preliminary hearing says, the premise of preserving evidence and under Article 265, this evidence could have been used later.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.320" offset="1860629">The fact that it was -- was not as of the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.947" offset="1871182">It was a part of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.193" offset="1880168">And moreover, as the Court noted, these preliminary hearings were taken in connection with the pending motion for bill of particulars, so it was exploratory in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.161" offset="1931995">But Chauvenet had nobody there.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.319" offset="1940668">He languished in jail while all this went on, and then finally, when Mr. Link got into the case, got his bond reduced to $5,000.00 and got him out jail shortly before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.317" offset="1992600">He was faced with this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.466" offset="2001272">He got a copy of the transcript of all his other motions and he knew what it happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.146" offset="2023946">And in that motion, there was a part that the state had a made an error as to the vendee on one of these transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.073" offset="2047666">They were later to amend it virtually on the eve of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.651" offset="2061981">They said it was sold to a different agent, Fullington instead of Abe.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.677" offset="2086118">But he actually didn't want to disturb that and he could not have gotten a preliminary hearing as a matter of right because under our Louisiana system, under Article 295 -- 292, the Court of criminal procedure, the right to a preliminary hearing is granted right only before the information or the indictment and he could -- and it will be highly status urged that he waived the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.240" offset="2220283">It's obvious that after having heard all of that testimony and after the trial Court said that he had no interest in those motions anyway because he didn't file them, the chances of either one out of a thousand, they would have granted him.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.375" offset="2272841">So Mr. Link did not file the motion and he relied on the error which was in there, which was cured by an amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.325" offset="2316622">Now, the state urges that even if we were -- even if there were errors to as to Chauvenet that we have no standing that challenged it that Skinner and Gueldner were not prejudiced.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.941" offset="2387153">It is our position because those motions would have been a real hearing if this man had been there.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.991" offset="2423306">The record shows that the state officers were interviewing this man in jail, trying to get a statement out of him, obviously trying to get him into state's evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.300" offset="2480567">We were not representing him.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.605" offset="2485791">We couldn't talk to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.024" offset="2491434">For all we knew, he might be state's evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.748" offset="2502405">And the most significant thing is that when they came to the trial, this is where they're prejudiced hits us right between the eyes.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.558" offset="2541589">For the first time, they come in with this completely unrelated heroin transaction in which Chauvenet alone was involved with the agent Fullington.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.679" offset="2590072">So we contend that that alone was clearly prejudicial and moreover, if this was a part of the trial, if this preliminary hearing which preserves evidence for the trial, which affects three co-defendants was a part of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.210" offset="2648168">We were entitled to have him there.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.873" offset="2654856">We might have found out something about it because the Court said that he was going to consider all that evidence in connection with the bill of particulars so it was exploratory.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.039" offset="2695502">So I now pass to the next point.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.865" offset="2702817">I would like to save myself 10 minutes for rebuttal if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.413" offset="2720998">The problem of the all night session and the sleeping jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.210" offset="2756211">This case started at 10:30 in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.112" offset="2767809">My associate Mr. Gill is a man 68 years old, suffering from diabetes and other complications which were testified too by his doctors and he's able as the record show to try a normal day but at 11:40, he begged the court to recess, 11:40 that night.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.203" offset="2848162">He had been going all day, hammer and tongs.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.213" offset="2860178">He asked him, he said, “I'm sick, you know I'm sick.”</text>
            <text syncTime="692.281" offset="2872508">And I'm quoting it all in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.200" offset="2884211">“Please give us a recess.”</text>
            <text syncTime="697.125" offset="2891839">They gave him a three-minute recess which he extended, generously extended for 35 minutes and then made them go nearly three o'clock in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.603" offset="2929768">Three o'clock, they recessed, came back at 9:30 and argued the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="718.000" offset="2975326">They had a -- I think he was technically arrested the night but there was no more testimony that night.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.306" offset="2996642">Yes.</text>

            <text syncTime="742.081" offset="3071666">Then it was brought out to the jurors who were sleeping.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.517" offset="3093400">There was considerable testimony, pro and con on that accorded the principal sources of it that covers many pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.262" offset="3128404">The most significant thing is though that there were two very strong witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.880" offset="3158915">The court's own trial of Mr. Marchi's in the face of the court's aggressive attitude of hostility toward decided that anybody was sleeping in his courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.397" offset="3200920">He took the stand and he said, he sure look like he was sleeping.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.227" offset="3216280">And then there was the one little sentence I'd like to read it from one of the witnesses, one of the other witnesses who was respondent of the District Attorney's very aggressive cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.099" offset="3283780">He was trying to get him to say, you got to say whether he was sleeping or not and the answer was this, answer: “When somebody's eyes are closed and his head is hanging down and he has to be woke up, I will draw the conclusion he's sleeping.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.227" offset="3336234">If somebody had to wake me up, I'd be sleeping.”</text>
            <text syncTime="812.543" offset="3353579">To which the prosecutor counted.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.609" offset="3361834">That is subjective, that's you.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.311" offset="3372596">There's no opinion there.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.953" offset="3379179">Answer: “If he wasn't sleeping, why would he have to be woke up.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1049.413" offset="4300988">Before beginning the argument, I'd like to inquire if the Court -- is the Court interested in this third point on which it grants certiorari, the conspiracy charge to the jury or is this Court interested only in the two points which petitioners have briefed?</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.213" offset="4352188">When this Court granted certiorari, three points were presented to this Court as allegations are there in the Court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.812" offset="4374653">One of them was that the trial judge charged the jury in this case on the law of conspiracy although conspiracy was not formerly charged in the bill of information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.344" offset="4412792">Now, although petitioners urged this strongly in their application for certiorari in their brief in this Court, they don't brief this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.237" offset="4448319">They say they don't think this Court is interested in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.572" offset="4457618">Now, we briefed it very strongly, however, if this Court is not interested in it, naturally, Louisiana will not argue it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1098.673" offset="4498056">Very well, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.518" offset="4501400">I'll answer three of the points then.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.619" offset="4517804">As far as the facts of the case go, I'll just briefly recapitulate what Mr. Leppert said that this charge grows out of a May 21st sale of heroin on Skinner's motor lot, motor mart to state undercover agent Ben Fullington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.722" offset="4602232">The test -- undercover agent Fullington testified that he went to Skinner's motor mart that day, met Skinner and Gueldner, told him that he was interested in getting some marijuana that either Skinner or Gueldner place to telephone call, told the undercover agent he could have the marijuana later that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.446" offset="4685197">Fullington testified that he return to the motor mart around 8 that evening was introduced by either Skinner or Gueldner to Chauvenet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.669" offset="4718007">The third accused in this case, that Chauvenet told the agent the stuff as they call the marijuana is in that white Lincoln parked on the lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.789" offset="4762520">That Fullington went and got a matchbox of marijuana out of the Lincoln and paid Chauvenet $20.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.382" offset="4792926">Now, a week later on the 28th of May, undercover agent Russell Abe who was working in close collaboration with Ben Fullington on this case, the testimony shows that on this week later that Gueldner phoned Russell Abe and told him that the connection that he'd spoken to him about was that the lot and that would sell him marijuana that Russell Abe went to the lot and was introduced to Chauvenet on this date a week later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.207" offset="4932211">Chauvenet took him into an office, sold him nine marijuana cigarettes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.871" offset="4950810">Gueldner also testified that he had told Gueldner -- I mean Russell Abe also testified that he told Gueldner a day or so beforew this meeting, that he was interested in contacts that would sell the heroin or marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.807" offset="5006608">On this second date, May 28, after Chauvenet had sold Abe the nine marijuana cigarettes in the office at the motor lot, he said, “How about some heroin?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.874" offset="5054882">And Chauvenet said, “I'll get you some, let's get in my car.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.462" offset="5069197">They went in Chauvenet's car to a spot away from the motor mart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.764" offset="5086438">There, Chauvenet obtained some heroin which he sold to Gueldner then on Chauvenet's instructions, Gueldner drove Chauvenet back to Skinner's lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.921" offset="5135026">On this date, Skinner and Gueldner were at the lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.571" offset="5149654">Gueldner had spoken to them about getting heroin and after the sale of heroin, Chauvenet was taken at Chauvenet's direction back to Skinner's lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.478" offset="5185285">Now, Louisiana will first discuss the absence of Chauvenet from the preliminary motions filed at the hearing of the preliminary motions filed by the other two accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.974" offset="5235231">These three men were arrested on July 30th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.232" offset="5248293">Skinner and Gueldner employed Mr. Gill to represent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.805" offset="5266578">Chauvenet appeared with the other two for arraignment, had no lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.594" offset="5289775">The Court entered a plea of not guilty for him, told him to return in a few days to determine counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.380" offset="5324884">The September -- the Betsy storm came in there somewhere, anyway, because the Court proceedings were delayed but anyway the Court appointed the first lawyer to represent Chauvenet sometime around at the end of September.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.729" offset="5382248">Unlike the allegation, contrary to the contention made by my opponents, a year did not elapse between the arrest of Chauvenet and his retention of Mr. Link here, six months elapsed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.052" offset="5443584">Chauvenet was arrested around the first of August, that is on the 30th of July.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.641" offset="5461974">He retained Mr. Link on the 18th of January of the following year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.800" offset="5478588">During that six months period, the Court appointed three lawyers for Mr. Chauvenet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.057" offset="5499591">None of them did anything for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.053" offset="5507636">However, Mr. Link concedes in his motion that he filed later which I will refer later that it was because of illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.812" offset="5542640">In fact, one of them died, Mr. Bentley Burns who was a prominent lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.129" offset="5559881">I don't know Mr. Joseph Mooney myself, the first lawyer appointed but I do know that Mr. Bentley Burns and Mr. Morris Burke are competent lawyers that -- who take care of their clients there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.785" offset="5602513">The allegation is that they were sick.</text>

            <text syncTime="1395.556" offset="5685582">Our position is this Mr. Justice that Chauvenet had a lawyer all this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.022" offset="5711496">Because of illness these lawyers could not -- did not file pleadings on his behalf nor did Skinner and Gueldner notify Chauvenet or his lawyers that they had filed these motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.368" offset="5752874">Now, right off Louisiana will concede that it would have been better if Chauvenet had been in present at those pre-trial hearings of Skinner and Gueldner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.483" offset="5785266">There's no doubt about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.429" offset="5789132">Our position is if this Court should give Chauvenet a new trial because of this -- his absence from these motions, he would be on no better position than the trial judge placed him in at this trial for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.725" offset="5842317">These hearings were held on behalf of Skinner and Gueldner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.023" offset="5859453">Before the trial, 60 days before the trial, Chauvenet engaged Mr. Link to represent him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.515" offset="5893413">On -- Mr. Link went into Court at this time and filed a motion set out on page 11 of Louisiana's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.895" offset="5935000">A written motion in which Mr. Link said pointed out to the Court that because of illness, the three lawyers whom the Court had appointed to represent Chauvenet had been unable to do anything for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.982" offset="5979303">Therefore this motion reads, a permission is asked to this Honorable Court to permit Chauvenet's attorney Mr. Link to determine whether it's necessary to file supplemental motions on Chauvenet's behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.336" offset="6032697">And that a minimum of 30 days delay be granted in order for defense counsel to properly study and evaluate the record already taken in these matters in order to file such pleadings as may be necessary in behalf of your defendant and he asked the Court to enable him to do justice to Chauvenet to furnish him with the transcript of all the pleadings and testimony which had been taken in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.775" offset="6122454">At very day, the trial judge ordered the Court reporter to furnish Mr. Link with the whole, the entire transcript of the proceedings that had gone before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.089" offset="6167698">He ordered the Court that the trial delayed for at least 30 days to permit Mr. Link to file similar pleadings on behalf of Chauvenet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.810" offset="6210644">In fact, the trial was delayed 60 days because a continuance is what we're asked for after that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.001" offset="6235408">So Mr. Link had all the transcript of the testimony, all of the motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.296" offset="6264560">He filed not one single thing on behalf of Chauvenet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.962" offset="6279189">As a matter of fact, he did two things which show clearly that he didn't think his client had been prejudiced by what went before three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.879" offset="6314924">And that he sort of adopted the proceedings as they were on the basis that Chauvenet's rights had been fully protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.887" offset="6338957">These are the things he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.045" offset="6347525">On the first day of trial, Mr. Link moved, the record all show this, as the trial was about to proceed, Mr. Link asked the Court that all motions previously filed and all bills of exception reserved be allowed to include his client Chauvenet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.813" offset="6430595">The Court ordered that it should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.601" offset="6437804">Anyway, under Louisiana law, joint defendants, when one reserves the bill, they automatically go.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.275" offset="6456508">He asked that all his motions be attributed to Chauvenet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.191" offset="6472182">The Court ordered it done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.699" offset="6478137">Moreover, as Your Honors will see in the written bills themselves, they filed first written bills which were reserved to the overruling of these preliminary motions all recite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.077" offset="6523695">During the trial of this case, Skinner, Gueldner, and Chauvenet filed motion to quash, motion for preliminary hearing which were overruled and we reserve these bills.</text>

            <text syncTime="1653.431" offset="6717106">Not only that, he used the transcript of the pre-trial proceedings to attempt to impeach witnesses at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.613" offset="6741870">Now, Louisiana's position is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.272" offset="6752423">It was too bad that Chauvenet wasn't at those preliminary hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.396" offset="6764962">We can see that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.530" offset="6769455">But unless this Court is going to hold that double jeopardy has set in and that Chauvenet can never, never be tried because of this mishap, then how will Chauvenet be put in a better position if this Court gives him a new trial than he was in already here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.701" offset="6830164">Because he had the transcript of the proceedings, all of the pleadings, he was given 60 days to file any motions of his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.838" offset="6858689">He adopted these pleadings as his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.583" offset="6865690">He used the transcript at the trial to cross-examine the witnesses any -- the two witnesses who appeared at these pre-trial hearings, Russell Abe and Fullington appeared again at the trial of the case so we don't have the point of situation here at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.079" offset="6935698">We don't have the point of situation because the two -- the only two witnesses who appear to these preliminary hearings appeared at the trial were cross-examined by Mr. Link using the testimony before trial to try to impeach them, so Louisiana as I said before and will say for the last time, if this Court should give Chauvenet a new trial because of his absence and unfortunate we conceded from these preliminary hearings after the trial judge did everything in his power to repair the damage and Mr. Link never before trial complained that his client was injured, then Louisiana doesn't see how he can be helped any further unless this Court says it's double jeopardy has set in and you can never try this man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.278" offset="7112495">And I will conclude Your Honor that point unless some of the members of this Court would like a further discussion on that particular point.</text>

            <text syncTime="1763.722" offset="7158262">Yes, they said that they didn't see how Chauvenet had been damaged by this point because this motion was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.633" offset="7189922">I tell you Your Honors a few more little things that are coming in my mind since I said I'd finish the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.025" offset="7211447">There was a motion to suppress filed and I concede that if this motion to suppress had been a valid motion, we would have problems here but it turns out a law of search warrant was sworn out in this case and the motion to suppress was based on the search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.484" offset="7273305">As a matter of fact, the motion to suppress fell flat on its face because it became immediately clear after a couple of minutes that the motion is suppressed that the police officers who had searched in his motor mart under the search warrant had found nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.223" offset="7344253">You see the evidence which was introduced at the trial of this case was the marijuana which was bought by the undercover agents in the transaction when -- so nothing and when the police officers searched Skinner motor mart under a search warrant after arresting these three men, they found nothing in the motor mart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.989" offset="7419277">Therefore, Mr. Gill withdrew his motion to suppress because it became moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.261" offset="7440384">There was nothing to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.108" offset="7447803">So the absence of Chauvenet, the fact I concede that if a motion to suppress was filed in the case involving three joint defendants and one of them wasn't present there and the evidence was later introduced against him at the trial, I concede that we would have a problem but that didn't happen here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.245" offset="7528364">So the preliminary hearing that was held applied only to Skinner and Gueldner and whether Louisiana had made out a prima facie case bind them over for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.083" offset="7567653">It didn't affect Chauvenet at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.124" offset="7583848">And the fact that Chauvenet wasn't present at these earlier meeting as Louisiana's position as we've said was unfortunate but we feel that trial judge did everything in his power to repair this as much as anything which is done can be repaired and that Chauvenet couldn't be in any better position in a new trial that he was in here because of what the judge did before trial to bring him up to day as it were, give him time for pleadings and everything to file in his own.</text>

            <text syncTime="2756.205" offset="11128142">These three men were jointly charged with sale and possession of marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.067" offset="11151653">Now, the actual delivery of the marijuana to the undercover agents took place just by Chauvenet although Skinner and Gueldner were on the lot and introduced the undercover agents to Chauvenet, they were not there when the marijuana was actually handed to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.300" offset="11236603">Therefore, during the trial of the case, Mr. Gill objected when say, agent Fullington, agent Abe there was testifying as to how he bought, how they bought the marijuana from Chauvenet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.207" offset="11284250">Mr. Gill objected Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.335" offset="11292714">This act is inadmissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.597" offset="11297729">It took place out of the presence of my client.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.366" offset="11316851">Well, certainly this is a good argument if there's just one defendant being tried because as Your Honors know, he can only introduced against an accused statements all acts that were done in his presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.674" offset="11362095">But the exception to this rule, the recognized exception in all jurisdictions is that if a conspiracy is involved in the case, you can introduce acts of any of the conspirators and if that the jury finds that a conspiracy existed, it's imputable to everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.635" offset="11449866">In other words, three people could decide to murder or rob and one person to stay home the whole time and the other one go out and do it, if you could prove that they conspire to do this, the person who stayed home would be just as guilty as the murder or so forth as the person who went to do the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.777" offset="11518516">So in the instant case, the trial judge allowed in this evidence of acts which took place out of Skinner and Gueldner's presence, allowed it in because the state, the judge's rule had made a prima facie showing of conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.888" offset="11574941">That a conspiracy existed between these three accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.629" offset="11589883">Now, when the trial judge came to charge the jury, he told them very --</text>

            <text syncTime="2900.063" offset="11703672">Therefore, the state feels that he was protecting, in fact the state knows that he was protecting the rights of Skinner and Gueldner when he told them this.</text>

            <text syncTime="3240.327" offset="13064652">And I'll use half of my five minutes just to read that if I may.</text>

            <text syncTime="3247.364" offset="13092864">The Court said, “It is true that the minutes of court must show that the accused was present at every important stage of a trial for a felony when the moment of his arraignment to his sentence stating a number of state, deciding a number of state cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.637" offset="13153886">But at stated supra, defendant Chauvenet pleaded not guilty and was thereafter represented by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.383" offset="13192861">Well, he was represented only in the sense that he had one on paper who never showed up for a period of --- she is correct, it wasn't a whole year, it was about seven months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.562" offset="13229641">But for seven months he was represented on paper only.</text>

            <text syncTime="3286.185" offset="13248136">His counsel did not file a motion to suppress under such circumstances, we conclude that it was imperative that he be present at the trial of the motion to suppress and dismiss, filed by defendants Skinner and Gueldner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.565" offset="13301635">Chauvenet suffered neither prejudice nor violation of his constitutional right.</text>
