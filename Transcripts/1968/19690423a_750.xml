            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 750, Glen Martin Harrington, petitioner versus California.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.188" offset="160162">Mr. Hanson.</text>

            <label>Mr. Roger S. Hanson</label>
            <text syncTime="15.367" offset="164864">Chief Justice Warren, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.043" offset="175522">This is a first-degree murder case out of the State of California from the City of Los Angeles and my client Mr. Harrington according to evidence participated in the robbery of a liquor store in the City of Los Angeles along with three other codefendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.377" offset="240828">The interesting thing about it was the -- three of the codefendants were Negro, Mr. Harrington was a Caucasian, and that is a significant factor which I'll point out as we go along here a little bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.551" offset="289625">The Court held the preliminary hearing in the case, according to California procedure, and at the time of the preliminary hearing why it showed quite conclusively that there's going to be a lot of problems in the way of confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.717" offset="342288">It seems that all three of the other codefendants Mr. Rhone, Mr. Bosby, and Mr. Cooper had made confessions which implicated themselves and each other and Mr. Harrington in this particular crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.644" offset="401951">At the time of the trial setting in various preliminary motions counsel for Mr. Harrington attempted to get a severance of the trials because of this problem and at that time he cited case of Delli Paoli versus United States and the Jackson versus Denno decision of this Court in an effort to get these trials severed.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.803" offset="486588">These motions were denied by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.887" offset="498918">And at various times during the trial motions were made to sever the thing each time as to Harrington being denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.665" offset="530056">I think it rather interesting that throughout this trial, numerous pages were devoted to in-chambers discussion between the counsel and the Court in an effort to alter these various confessions in such a way that no incriminating statements were made as to one man versus the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.128" offset="619917">I set that out in my brief and it's contained in the single appendix for the Court and I think it's very exemplary of the impossibility in this particular case that is in most cases to make a meaningful deletion of the names to the point where in this case it became so ridiculous that the Court upon being accused by Mr. Harrington's attorney at that time of trying to make the matter more difficult for his counsel said, "I'm going to let all of these confessions going in just the way they stand unedited."</text>
            <text syncTime="157.394" offset="732975">Now, Mr. Rhone made the confession which was probably the most damaging and I suppose the single possibly weak point in my position here is that Mr. Rhone in fact did take the stand for cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.367" offset="792848">The other two gentlemen, Mr. Cooper and Mr. Bosby are referred to Mr. Harrington as the white man, the Caucasian and various other terms never actually calling him by name which is a probably cause of the fact that they didn't know each other too well.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.701" offset="850213">And so in that particular sense neither one of the other two actually named Mr. Harrington but without a doubt because all four of them were being jointly tried, all four of them setting at the counsel table together, three negroes and the Caucasian Mr. Harrington coupled with Mr. Rhone's confession actually naming Mr. Harrington where there's little doubt that in my opinion all four these confessions, there are three of the confessions, solidified each other and brought home the inevitable result that took place in this particular trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.141" offset="983960">Now, it's my contention here of course when I filed the petition for certiorari of this Court it was prior to the decision of the Court in Bruton versus United States and Roberts versus Russell.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.149" offset="1035995">At the time I filed petition, I was going after a reversal of the Delli Paoli case and so when the Court handed down the Bruton decision, Roberts versus Russell decision, I anticipated the cases being remanded to the Second District Court of Appeals in California with the usual admonition to reconsider the case in a matter not inconsistent with this particular opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.385" offset="1128887">And so I was elated to have a chance come to Washington when the Court granted a hearing in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.185" offset="1164100">It's my contention upon reviewing all the decisions of this Court and the prime one that I hang my head on is the Brookhart versus Janis case, 384 U.S. 1 decision by Mr. Justice Black which I've cited throughout my documents that I've filed that if there was a denial of confrontation of witnesses without waiver why it be a constitutional error, the first order magnitude and no amount of prejudice -- one, a prejudice would save this error from the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.923" offset="1295026">Of course in the Brookhart case as the Court knows with malice aforethought, the confession of the codefendant was actually used against Mr. Brookhart.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.664" offset="1334000">It was introduced for that particular purpose and so the Court without hesitation in an eight-man opinion by Mr. Justice Black reversed that case without recourse to any consideration of harmless error rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.730" offset="1382275">In the Bruton case then if I interpret that case correctly the Court went on to acknowledge that in its opinion it would be impossible for a jury to discern the difference between confession to this type being given by (a) with an instruction do not consider against (b) only considered against (a) never against (b), by Mr. Justice Brennan in that case if I add Brookhart to Bruton, it's my position in front of this Court today that it calls for an automatic reversal of this case and all such cases on a national basis without recourse to any harmless error rules whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.615" offset="1557817">Now, in the concurring opinion by Mr. Justice Stewart in Chapman versus California there is numerous type of errors at the setout which call for automatic reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.149" offset="1604002">As I understand Mr. Justice Stewart in that case you took position that no harmless error rule should be applied at all with these particular type of errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.926" offset="1643081">And as I go through the various types of cases that this Court has passed judgment on the Gideon versus Wainwright type of denial at counsel reversed without recourse to a harmless error and retroactively so.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.832" offset="1702745">The Jackson versus Denno case which is a very analogous type of error reversed without the recourse to a harmless error rule, retroactively so.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.674" offset="1738062">In other words, we have in one hand as I study the cases, the type of errors that actually took place during the trial itself the denial of counsel at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.265" offset="1780381">The introduction of course confessions, this type of thing which actually permeated at the very trial itself as opposed to certain pretrial type of maneuvers in the way of the Miranda errors where the Court said that it's a reason for reversing and not making it retroactive was because of the fact it wanted to discourage police conduct in this errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.075" offset="1879646">The search and seizure issues of course are along the same line but this type of error which we have in front of the Court today; to me, there can be no question whatsoever that it has to be resulting in a reversal without recourse to any harmless error rules whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.854" offset="1958745">I think based to my own personal experience in Los Angeles and trying some major cases that I can think of no more severe error that a defense counsel would have to attempt to overcome in this particular one that took place in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.165" offset="2016005">I think it alters entirely the defense of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.386" offset="2028962">The State of Illinois in its amicus curiae brief pointed out that after all Mr. Harrington did no more than what the State of California to its test to see if it had enough evidence to convict him, he did not take the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.978" offset="2079326">He put on next to no defense whatsoever and I simply contend and point out to the Court that in my opinion when a magnitudinal error such as three confessions were introduced against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.460" offset="2129168">The entire strategy of the case would change.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.925" offset="2139094">He was -- I must admit a previous loser.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.255" offset="2152364">He'd been doing time up in San Quentin for previous crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.057" offset="2163649">He therefore had the problem that he would be impeached as a witness by previous convictions of a felony and so the counsel at that time apparently elected to not put him on the stand and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.405" offset="2208998">Therefore, I contend the entire strategy of the trial is altered by this particular difficulty and it's impossible for any reviewing court to say with any certainty that harmless error did not take place if the Court is constrained to even apply harmless error rule to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.635" offset="2281932">The -- this Court of course is considered in analogous situation in the Barber versus Page case of the past term where the preliminary hearing testimony was introduced at the trial without making an effort to get the witness in front of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.563" offset="2361657">Again, the reversal without recourse to harmless error rules and in the recent case of Berger versus California, the Court made it again retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.520" offset="2401468">And I can only conclude that this Court did the requisite amount of soul searching during the deliberations in chambers as to the magnitude of this particular error.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.676" offset="2442115">I don't think the Court would make an error of this magnitude retroactive and unless it considered it to be a severe one, tremendously severe one.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.606" offset="2481821">And it's my contention that because of this severity of this error, it is not at all applicable to any type of harmless error rules that must be reversed per se throughout the nation when this type of thing takes place.</text>

            <text syncTime="929.302" offset="3820544">The interesting thing about it was when these people reported the crime and made their statements to the police, the man without hesitation admitted that he said four Negroes carried this crime out.</text>

            <text syncTime="978.462" offset="4017194">I would ask the Court to in its opinion attempt to spell out with very specificity this Bruton, Roberts versus Russell error that has been one that has hang around for many, many years.</text>

            <text syncTime="1036.708" offset="4250206">I just can't believe that this type of error has any different in the Gideon versus Wainwright error if I look at the Sixth Amendment and read it I see the right of counsel and the right to confront witnesses in the same paragraph.</text>

            <text syncTime="1407.384" offset="5732916">At this point, I would like to tell this Court the experience of California as the joint trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.560" offset="5757576">We have a penal code statute which authorizes joint trials and we have obtained statistics from the Los Angeles District Attorney's office with regard to joint trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.669" offset="5806059">For the years 1967 and 1968, statistics for these two years, from this particular county reflect that approximately 20% of the trials involved two or more defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.862" offset="5870843">Now, if this percentage prevails throughout the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.327" offset="5884635">This represents a sizeable number of cases in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.426" offset="5905115">For instance in 1967, there was a total of 13,500 contested criminal matters tried in the Superior of Court of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.208" offset="5940224">In 1968, there was a total of 16,140 contested criminal matters tried in the superior courts throughout the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.086" offset="5975751">As you can tell the figures are progressingly getting higher and if you go back 10 years, you go back 20 years, you go back 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.813" offset="6022666">The adequate number of cases affected by Bruton is truly staggering.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.907" offset="6043042">Now, let's turn our attention to Mr. Hanson's first contention that the Chapman harmless error rule is not applicable to a Bruton type situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.353" offset="6092779">As I have indicated in my brief, the vast number of cases subsequent to Bruton which had discussed this issue have held that Bruton is not automatically reversible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.340" offset="6148681">I submit that logic and some policy support this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.534" offset="6169475">It is obvious that there are material variances in codefendant's statements with regard as to their incubating effect as well as to whether the fact they added critical weight to the prosecution's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.940" offset="6231124">Now, if an automatic reversal rule is adopted by this Court, then a Bruton situation would be reversed regardless if the particular error conceivably played any part in the verdict either on direct appeal or on collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.828" offset="6318686">Indirectly, you -- this Court has indicated in Gilbert versus California that a harmless error rule is applicable to a Bruton type situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.129" offset="6355884">There, if you recall the petitioner had a confession used against the man which he was mentioned approximately 159 times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.173" offset="6392038">The petition -- the petitioner there requested that this Court overrule Delli Paoli at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.571" offset="6421608">And this Court declined to do so noting that the California Supreme Court had adopted in random we have -- which had rejected Delli Paoli.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.168" offset="6464031">This Court also noted that the California Supreme Court had held the particular Bruton error harmless in Griffin and in this Court noted that the harmless error standard applied by the California Supreme Court was substantially and compliance with Fahey and Chapman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.951" offset="6547205">Therefore, this Court declined to rule on overrule a Delli Paoli at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.142" offset="6575940">Now, I would submit that the fair import of these remarks is that Bruton is subject to a Chapman's harmless errors standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.343" offset="6624737">It should be noted that the Bruton case was an extreme case factually.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.561" offset="6645635">The codefendant's statement was not admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.416" offset="6660995">I guess the codefendant Evans as a result since it was inadmissible against Evans there is nothing on the other hand in which to alleviate any possible prejudice against Bruton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.574" offset="6713657">Also, the identification evidence was much weaker against Bruton than against Evans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.589" offset="6741765">And as a result on retrial, Evans was acquitted and so therefore the Solicitor General indicated because of these facts that case should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.906" offset="6783039">Now, we contend that the evidence in the instant case is much stronger than was the situation in Bruton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.275" offset="6816475">Before I apply the Chapman harmless error standard to the instant case, I would like to delineate six factors which I think is pertinent to any inquiry in applying Chapman to a Bruton type situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.759" offset="6882408">The first situation -- the first factor to consider of course is the quality of the limiting instruction given by the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.791" offset="6918562">If a particularly lucid and precise instruction is probably given to the jury before the statement is introduced in the evidence, I would think this would help alleviate some of the prejudice of an incriminating statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.684" offset="6986062">And I note with interest Frazier versus Cupp which was rendered by this Court yesterday and which in the context of an opening statement this Court indicated that a limiting instruction can be affected to that extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.307" offset="7048652">The second factor to consider of course is the nature of the codefendant's statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.951" offset="7075192">There, the defendant assumed his fair share of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.242" offset="7088358">This Court noted in Bruton that it is common with codefendants to shift the blame but if the defendant assumes his fair share of the guilt that is something to consider also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.287" offset="7136528">The third factor to consider also is the amount of detail concerning actions of other parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.066" offset="7167666">In other words, if the details in the incriminating confessions is quite skimpy in comparison with the other prosecution evidence, I would think this would be a pertinent inquiring applying Chapman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.756" offset="7218448">The fourth factors take in consideration is the weight of the other evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.231" offset="7244257">Now, if the weight of the other evidence is quite strong then it would be my contention that it would -- the jury would be more unlikely to disobey a Court's limiting instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.053" offset="7307577">And the fifth factor to consider of course is the nature of the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.244" offset="7332342">Did the defendant offer any testimony in support of his defense or did he just put the prosecution to its proof.</text>

            <text syncTime="2342.369" offset="9472815">It is true the standard utilized by the lower court that the state harmless error standard but it is my contention in view of the language of the lower court that the harmless error standard utilized as such is the equivalent of Chapman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.251" offset="9540420">I'd like to point out that in Gilbert versus California, a comparable situation was thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.038" offset="9567483">There, the California Supreme Court had utilized the state harmless error standard in reference to Griffin error and the -- this Court indicated that that standard was substantially equivalent of Fahey and Chapman as a result indicated that it may not overruled Delli Paoli.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.520" offset="9645432">So, I would indicate that the same reasoning it can be applied here since it is the -- it is virtually inconceivable as what I would equate beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.851" offset="9694751">Now, let's turn our attention to Bosby's statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.400" offset="9712933">In regard to Bosby's statement counsel for petitioner Harrington made an interesting comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.784" offset="9738533">This is contained at page 237 of the single appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.533" offset="9757550">And his state as follows in reference to Bosby's statement "largely here in the Bosby statement we have a statement which is not in essence terribly incriminating against Harrington as it was originally given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.518" offset="9825468">He didn't even know Harrington's name."</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.628" offset="9841873">And that's true, he didn't even know Harrington's first name.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.967" offset="9859218">He further described Harrington as a blonde headed fellow and this is contained at page 286 of the single appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.662" offset="9906030">All the prosecution witnesses in the instant case indicated that the defendant was red-haired man that he had a bright red shinny hair and yet Bosby describes him as a blonde headed fellow and if the jury literally followed that description they would think that some other defendant besides Harrington was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.561" offset="10005608">Furthermore, in comparison with Rhone's confession as compared to Bosby's confession the details of the white man is extremely limited for instance, Bosby indicated that he presumed that the white man entered the store with Charles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.854" offset="10086797">Bosby did not know where the white man was at the time of the gunshot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.004" offset="10115427">Furthermore, Bosby never saw him with a gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.872" offset="10130892">So, when you compare Harrington's statement which is not -- I mean when you compare Rhone's statement which does not fall within the Bruton ambit, Bosby's statement is extremely limited with reference to the incriminating details as to the white man's role in the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.243" offset="10208319">Now, let's turn our attention to the two statements of Cooper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.751" offset="10222425">Cooper actually made two statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.126" offset="10231829">The first statement of course is an exculpatory statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.994" offset="10251368">There, he denied any involvement in the crime whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.469" offset="10269236">He merely indicate that he entered the store, approached this cashier's register, attempted to cash a check, and noticed that there's a scuffle subsequent gun shot, he became frightened he then ran out the store, got in his car and three other people got in his car.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.896" offset="10346977">Interesting enough, he mentions the fact that there were other Caucasians around the store before he entered the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.304" offset="10380622">While he is attempting the cash to check at the cash register, he indicates that there was a white guy behind him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.876" offset="10406849">Now, we don't know that this white guy that was behind and refers to petitioner Harrington to some other Caucasian who -- that Cooper had made reference to before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.772" offset="10458467">He also indicated that there is a white boy in Cooper's car at the time Cooper got in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.710" offset="10486262">At no time did Cooper get in to -- at no time did Cooper see the white boy with a gun which is again a variance with the prosecution testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.547" offset="10541537">Details of the white man's role in the robbery is even more skimpy than Bosby's confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.814" offset="10574660">Now, Cooper second statement that is the Cooper's confession is only three pages long.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.029" offset="10599528">It has a few more details of what the white man did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.279" offset="10616456">Now, the four of them did go to the store, four of them did go into the store, the white man followed Cooper into the store and that is the only reference that we have with reference to the white man as to Cooper's confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.951" offset="10675179">Again, we don't know what transpired in the store, we don't know whether Harrington had a gun, we don't know whether Harrington tried to get in the cash register or not, in short, the references to Cooper and Bosby's statement are very limited in describing the activities of the white man involved in the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.308" offset="10776639">The white man's role implying the robbery, we don't know about and comparison with Rhone's confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.892" offset="10806941">Rhone is quite explicit on all these things and I would contend that Cooper's and Bosby's statement are merely cumulative of detail which was admissible in Rhone's confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.820" offset="10858663">In addition, the other address presented by the prosecution was exceedingly strong for this was no circumstantial evidence as was the situation in Chapman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.856" offset="10906833">We have not two witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.139" offset="10915924">We have three witnesses who positively identified petitioner Harrington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.890" offset="10938911">We have Mrs. Robins, the proprietor of the store, her brother Mr. Ashbreath (ph) as well as a customer by the name of Mrs. Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.880" offset="10982902">Now, two of these witnesses described Harrington as a red-haired chap.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.379" offset="11012890">It should be noted at the time of trial Harrington did not have red hair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.343" offset="11032743">He had black hair because Harrington had dyed his hair black after the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.788" offset="11062523">And I would claim that this is significant in strengthening their identification since they recognized the fact that this was the red haired chap that they had seen going into the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.709" offset="11110170">Furthermore, we have Harrington's very incriminating statements he made to the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.762" offset="11130441">Harrington admitted the fact that he was the red hair chap that had entered the store with three Negro companions that after the murder he run to the car with three other Negroes that subsequent thereto he dyed his hair red, he shaved off his red mustache and I must agree with the lower court it is virtually inconceivable that any jury would have concluded come to any other conclusion that it did even absent the error of admitting Bosby and Cooper's statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.064" offset="11287594">Furthermore, I would think that the -- as I've indicated earlier I think the lower court has resolved the harmless error using a Chapman test and I would analogize to the situation in Gilbert versus California which this Court indicated that when a California Supreme Court utilized a standard comparable to Chapman that was permissible and I would think the lower court did since the lower did the same thing in the instant case that should -- that rational should be applicable here also.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.996" offset="11419355">Next, I would like to discuss retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.351" offset="11436805">I approached this subject with the little bit of concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.028" offset="11467525">It is my purpose in discussing retroactivity with the hope that you would reconsider Roberts versus Russell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.988" offset="11511306">Now, this Court has indicated there are three criteria in determining whether rule should be prospectively applied or retroactively applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.455" offset="11549236">They are the purpose of the rule, the reliance on the old rule, the effect on the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.187" offset="11576090">Now, the purpose of Bruton obviously is to insure the reliability of the fact find process but that purpose may not necessitate the fact that the rule has to be applied retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.453" offset="11629171">For instance, in Johnson versus New Jersey, this Court indicated it's a question of probability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.241" offset="11652368">She have to look to see if there's other safeguards and by comparison I would compare the situation in Stovall versus Denno which this Court limited the retroactivity as the line of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.007" offset="11703359">Now, surely there can be no greater effecting of the reliability of fact-finding process than to have this suggested lineup and a mistaken identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.544" offset="11753514">Certainly that leads to miscarriage of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.486" offset="11765321">Yet, this Court indicated that in that situation you decided to limit retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.094" offset="11795728">Now, I would quarrel with this Court with the fact that Bruton does not affect the integrity of the factfinding process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.857" offset="11826761">To me, it does not and I would rely on the language of Judge Learned Hand who stated that while Bruton, Delli Paoli procedure rest on a fiction it still helps the jury in ascertaining the truth and I would like to emphasize the fact that statement of codefendant's traditionally have been viewed with suspicion and distrust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.559" offset="11949641">A statement of a person himself has a lot more impact on a jury that a statement of a codefendant who's blaming somebody else and I would submit that a limiting instruction in the proper case in view of the fact that a codefendant is blaming something else --</text>

            <text syncTime="3010.332" offset="12144724">For over 70 years, this Court has indicated that Delli Paoli procedure is all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.724" offset="12174294">As late as January 23, 1967 in Spencer versus Texas, this Court has cited Delli Paoli and indorsed Delli Paoli and as late as June 12, 1967 a Gilbert versus California this Court declined to overrule Delli Paoli.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.059" offset="12251617">And I submit that as late as 1967 in view of Spencer and Gilbert that it would been have most difficult to predict the demise of Delli Paoli.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.649" offset="12301981">It should be nor that Jackson versus Denno which this Court indicate for shall Bruton was decided June of 1964 and Gilbert is nearly three years later and yet this Court declined to overrule Delli Paoli.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.624" offset="12361853">And I would like to emphasize the fact that this does will effect the significant number of cases throughout the courts, throughout the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.844" offset="12398738">I think this new constitutional rule of doctrine of Bruton should be prospectively applied because Bruton only assist those who really bond together, those vicious criminals who engaged in robbery such as the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.179" offset="12456103">And Bruton helps those criminals who have been in jail, the longest if retroactivity doctrine is still adhere to by this Court that means that a conviction is 20 years old would have to be reversed and the chances of retrial are almost de minimis because of the fact that witnesses cannot be located and the fact that witnesses recollection fade.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.159" offset="12580028">A fully retroactive Bruton along with the fact that it is not subject to a harmless error rule were truly have a profound effect on administration of criminal justice throughout in every jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.695" offset="12642200">This is demonstrated by the fact that we have over 28 amici joined respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.303" offset="12668635">They show us the concern of the states as to applying this rule retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.592" offset="12689742">So I earnestly solicit this Court and earnestly ask this Court to reconsider Roberts versus Russell since Roberts versus Russell had not been briefed and these considerations are not being brought to the Court's attention before its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.622" offset="12757870">So therefore, we would urge that the judgment of the lower court be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3180.138" offset="12823907">As far as the retroactivity facts of this case go, I'm sure this Court has pondered that time and time again in its decision on Barber versus Page and Berger versus California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.401" offset="12873017">I feel that the damage that is going to take place in this nation has already taking place by the judgment of retroactivity by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.245" offset="12916381">It's my contention that if we're going to have a minimum of litigation in this country at appellate level, the only way that that can really be taking care of is a reversibility per se because if a court honestly, honestly applies the federal harmless error rule which I think is the very minimal that is going to come out of this discussion today.</text>
