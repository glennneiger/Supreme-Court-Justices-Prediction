            <label>Mr. Dean H. Bilton</label>
            <text syncTime="43.826" offset="278653">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.644" offset="289938">This is an appeal from the entry of interlocutory injunction by a three-judge court after that three-judge court found one subsection of the Illinois intimidation statute unconstitutional on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.066" offset="343646">That court said that the statue was over broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.525" offset="357439">The statute is part of the Illinois Criminal Code, Chapter 38, Section 12-6 (a) (3) and it's a rather short statute and may I just read it to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.034" offset="395473">It says that a person commits intimidation when with the intent to cause another to perform or to omit the performance of any act, he communicates to another a threat to perform without lawful authority any of the following acts, and the part that we are involved with today is a threat to commit any criminal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.416" offset="477080">I was quite shocked this morning when I opened up the Washington Post and found out that this was supposed to be a case that dealt with violence and some kind of mob action and for a year and so in the Law Week they ascribe this is some kind of a statute that prohibits threats.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.533" offset="553462">This statute does not prohibit threats, it is not a public order statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.622" offset="573837">This statute is a crime against a person and it's so codified in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.500" offset="593377">This is an extortion statute, an extortion is a robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.862" offset="610826">The only difference between extortion and robbery -- robbery is, "give me your money or I'll do something to you right now" and extortion is, "give me your money or I'll do something to you in a short while or a little bit later."</text>
            <text syncTime="138.740" offset="658369">And I see that this morning we are joined here with the Younger case which is the Criminal Syndicalism case and the Samuels' case and Fernando's, all of them involving anarchy and public order.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.576" offset="697657">The gun case coming up tomorrow is disorderly conduct case, Dyson and Karalexis are obscenity cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.606" offset="721795">This case is quite, quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.004" offset="731408">This is a crime against a person and the object of protection here is the person and his right to keep his money in his pocket and we think that threats to take that man's money away or threats being used as weapons to remove that money are never considered free speech and for that reason of course, we feel that very initially this statute is just not unconstitutional, it's being a violation of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.079" offset="835688">We may have misled this Court in reaching these conclusions about this being a statute that prohibits threats when we set out our question presented on page 4 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.281" offset="880515">Our question presented said that this statute is an extortion statute that deals with threats to commit crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.973" offset="911235">A more accurate statement would be that this was a statute that prohibits one from taking or attempting to take the property or to protect the rights of another through the use of threats to commit crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.314" offset="956583">And we think it's in that light that this statute ought be viewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.132" offset="975914">The very first issue in this case is one of standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.649" offset="997961">The plaintiffs here were seven subclasses of black people in Chicago, all claiming to be black activists and all under certain pending state charges and the defendants here were all, who are the appellants in this case, all members of the official dome of the City of Chicago in the County of Cook who were charged with the prosecution of the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.019" offset="1099421">None of the appellees were charged with this intimidation statute at anytime and there are no pending state charges against the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.007" offset="1139440">The appellees in their complaint stated that all the statutes involved and there were five of them including violence, resisting arrest, aggravated assault, aggravated battery and intimidation were all being used by the defendants in furtherance of a bad-faith conspiracy to keep these appellees from exercising their First Amendment rights and they used the Dombrowski allegations of a chilling effect and bad-faith conspiracy and they say these words.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.447" offset="1265142">There was an answer filed denying the existence of this conspiracy and a three-judge court sat and heard the threshold question of the constitutionality of this statute on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.160" offset="1316028">By the way, there never has been a trial and onto the merits of this complaint there has be no proof of any bad-faith conspiracy existing among these appellants, defendants below to do the acts of which they were accused in the complaint.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="351.735" offset="1510275">It was a declaratory judgment in the broadest advisory sense, was it not?</text>

          <turn speaker="dean_h_bilton" startTime="357.984" stopTime="685.048">
            <label>Mr. Dean H. Bilton</label>
            <text syncTime="357.984" offset="1535352">In a very pure broad abstract sense, that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.427" offset="1561057">By the way the one subsection of the intimidation said statute that was said out in the complaint was a section that refers to intimidation by public officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.771" offset="1606405">It wouldn't have applied to the plaintiff's at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.244" offset="1624377">It was intimidations by a public official in withholding his own action or doing something that he shouldn't have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.753" offset="1654366">So truly, when we went to our hearing before the three-judge court, no one under -- really understood what was the problem with the intimidation statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="398.197" offset="1696162">It wasn't until after the three-judge court opinion that we find out and discover that the court thought that this one subsection is over broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.537" offset="1733569">Now, looking at standing, the court said that the plaintiffs had standing because they were not charged with any of the offenses here and that therefore they came under the right of the Dombrowski case and the Zwickler case to give such people declaratory judgments when they claim that their First Amendment rights are being infringed upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.323" offset="1824684">We submit to this Court that both Dombrowski and Zwickler are quite distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.966" offset="1847254">In both Dombrowski and Zwickler, the plaintiffs there had a history in Louisiana and in New York of having the statutes that they complained about being used against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.460" offset="1897200">Mr. Dombrowski held up his organization in Louisiana and he was arrested and he was charged with violating a Louisiana sedition statute and then a motion of quash stopped that prosecution against Mr. Dombrowski.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.586" offset="1961671">He then went into the federal district court and sought relief to stop future prosecutions under that over broad statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.302" offset="1988629">So, we had a history of facts that he could point to and said, "Look, are they going to do that to me again."</text>
            <text syncTime="476.356" offset="2008795">And in fact, the State of Louisiana (Inaudible) Mr. Dombrowski by rating him shortly after he filed his complaint in the District Court and indicted him for the sedition statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.926" offset="2047039">And in Zwickler case, a New York man who was distributing handbills anonymously, he was arrested and he was found guilty under a New York statute that said, "You can't distribute election campaign literature anonymously in quantity."</text>
            <text syncTime="501.951" offset="2111195">His conviction was later overturned by the New York Supreme Court on the criminal elements but didn't reach the constitutional points.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.747" offset="2142333">Zwickler, then went to the US District Court, filed his complaint for declaratory judgment and said, "I'm going to do the same thing in the next election and they're going to apply the statute to me again in the next election."</text>
            <text syncTime="520.250" offset="2184338">So, he too had some facts that he could point to justify his conclusions that the state was going to apply this over broad statute against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.284" offset="2224462">Now, in our case none of the 15 or so named plaintiffs nor the Organization Act or any of the plaintiffs that joined in later on or ever were charged with this intimidation statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.350" offset="2268766">They didn't even set it out in their complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.249" offset="2276394">So, we don't believe that a person has the right to come in to the District Court and to say the magic words, to say that my First Amendment rights are being chilled and that gives him an automatic right to get a declaratory judgment of any statute that he still chooses and that's what happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.958" offset="2347238">So, for those reasons we do not believe that the plaintiffs here in the first place had standing to challenge the act that they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.020" offset="2383496">I will admit however that both Dombrowski and Zwickler do give the federal courts jurisdiction to sit in declaratory judgments when a person is not charged with a pending state case.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.442" offset="2441174">Now, looking at the statute itself or on its merits, we do not believe the statute is unconstitutional and our brief from pages 13 to page 20, we have a compilation of the First Amendment cases as best we could and we drew two conclusions and that is one, that First Amendment cases are treated on a case by case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.495" offset="2537305">The rule of law seems to be that to balance the interest of the speaker against whatever state interest is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.006" offset="2567398">Well, in this statute the interest of the speaker is that of a thief.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.124" offset="2587878">He is attempting to take something from another person by the use of threats and the protected interest involved is the states' right to protect individuals in their person and in their safety and in their possessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.691" offset="2642108">We don't think there's any -- there's no contest here.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.790" offset="2654542">On those -- on that test alone, the statute should be considered a valid exercise of the states' power and not over broad statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.041" offset="2695502">I believe that the three-judge court misunderstood the statute because it said that the statute was over broad because it prohibited threats of insubstantial evil.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.192" offset="2744090">Well, this is incorrect in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.294" offset="2756524">First of all, the statute doesn't prohibit threats.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.296" offset="2768541">It prohibits extortion by threats, it prohibits robbery by threats, but it doesn't prohibit threats in the abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.374" offset="2796857">People can get up and speak about advocating crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.420" offset="2813053">They can get up and threaten all they want.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.727" offset="2822248">If there is no extortion element present, this statute doesn't prohibit that kind of conduct.</text>

            <label>Mr. Dean H. Bilton</label>
            <text syncTime="703.951" offset="2919215">It probably be -- in that sense, it probably would overlap with kidnapping and certainly overlaps with robbery because it's at the same kind of statute depending how close the intimidating factor is.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.968" offset="2971251">If I hold a gun in your head and say, "Give me your money or I'll kill you in five minutes," I might be committing extortion or I might be committing robbery, depending on whether or not the incidence of violence is immediate or delayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.469" offset="3021197">Extortion is that statute which picks up where robbery leaves off.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.614" offset="3037811">Yes, I believe that there is an overlapping here with other state statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.230" offset="3064247">Secondly, that the court in that one statement about the statute prohibiting threats of insubstantial evil, this idea of insubstantial evil was a question that even victim has to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.210" offset="3116178">What might be a very small weapon to a court might be a very major weapon to the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.902" offset="3138957">So, when the court said that there are little crimes which might not be too scary to a person they did not -- the court didn't place itself in the shoes of that victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.669" offset="3182007">He might be just the kind of a person that would be intimidated by a small offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.383" offset="3204890">Now, the point that the court I believe did loss sight of the object of the protection of the statute and thought that this was a public order statute, I'd like to just point to the opinion that's set out in page 94 of our appendix and may I just read these two sentences here or three sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.221" offset="3288273">The court said, "Indeed, the phrase, commit any criminal offense is so broad as to include threats to commit misdemeanors punishable by fine only.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.051" offset="3331532">These evils are not so substantial that the state's interest in prohibiting the threat of them outweighs the public interest in giving legitimate political discussion a wide birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.025" offset="3379493">Since the language of subparagraph a (3) is an over broad restriction and the freedom of speech is invalid, obviously however, if the threat is carried out, the persons who violate the criminal law by their acts are subject to punishment."</text>
            <text syncTime="833.091" offset="3435708">Well, this notion that it is better to let man threaten and speak to preserve the First Amendment and then arrest him when he commits action is a good notion for statutes that protect public order, but if I say to you, "Give me your money or I will break your windows later on" and you give me your money, I never carry out the threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.499" offset="3533406">So, the action here, the threat here is a weapon and the weapon --</text>

            <text syncTime="1612.034" offset="6551489">-- may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.730" offset="6558281">I'd like to first address myself to the standing issue and then to the issue on the merits of whether or not for an analysis of the statute it was over broad and deterred First Amendment freedoms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.556" offset="6613556">First of all, I think Mr. Bilton got himself into a problem with the standing issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.534" offset="6637484">You see in this particular case, the history of this case is such that it's here only on one particle of a broad problem that was brought to court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.546" offset="6681579">This case grew out of a situation in 1967 where there were five mass arrest situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.649" offset="6717942">A committee of 22 lawyers of the local bar and some from out of town got together basically a Dombrowski complaint, taking from some of these mass arrest situations, sometimes there had been 55 people arrested and as many as 100 in other occasions and making them members or representatives of the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.931" offset="6799130">We have here seven subclasses of the total class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.145" offset="6815953">One subclass was arrested as a group on August 01, 1967 charged with mini crimes, mob action and disorderly conduct being the main ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.771" offset="6870497">Another group was arrested on May 21th, 1967 also charged with mob action and disorderly conduct and resisting arrest and a few other charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.563" offset="6913651">September 14th, 1967, another group was arrested and charged with mob action, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.516" offset="6953462">Now, -- then again, on August 23rd, 1967, another group was arrested and charged with mob action, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.521" offset="6993481">And then to round off this particular plus -- also in August 4th, 1967, another group was arrested and charged with mob action, disorderly conduct and I believe also resisting arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.017" offset="7055444">Now, we added also a group known as ACT which was an incorporated association which more or less advocated the confrontation of public issues in a forum of the streets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.021" offset="7115421">We also added as members of the class individuals who had not been arrested and charged with anything, but merely were Negroes who wanted to speak out against what was happening in the City of Chicago at that time in 1967 and we put them in the class and alleged that their First Amendment rights were being chilled by this particular plan of action that was being perpetrated by the City of Chicago on people of arresting them with no hope of convictions, with high bonds and keeping them in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.248" offset="7244361">Sometimes two weeks before we could go in on motions to reduce the bail or could get them out by raising the bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.558" offset="7277589">Now, this Court in the Golden v. Zwickler case set the following language with regard to issue of standing, although there probably they were addressing -- you were addressing yourselves to the issue of mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.327" offset="7332655">But you said the difference between an abstract question and a controversy contemplated by the Declaratory Judgment Act is necessarily one of degree and it would difficult if it would be possible to fashion a precise test for determining in every case whether there is such a controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.989" offset="7411336">Basically, the question in each case is whether there is a substantial controversy between parties having adverse legal interest of sufficient eminence, immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment and you cited in support of that the Maryland case and the company case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.325" offset="7488658">Now, in this particular case, you have to know something about the City of Chicago in order to understand how the intimidation statute gets here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.662" offset="7526066">The City of Chicago has a large corporation of counsel's office which is charged with admitting instances among other things, the enforcement of the City's ordinances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.545" offset="7565563">And in 1967, a gentleman named Richard Elrod who later became a state legislator with who was at that time in the ordinance enforcement division of the corporation of counsel's office was present at every major demonstration in the City of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.674" offset="7626062">And he was the man on the scene charged with the duty of telling the Chicago police who they would arrest, when they would affect the arrest, and what charges would be brought against the alleged defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.842" offset="7674755">Now, he was present at each and every one of these instances that I quoted to you in the complaint of the five groups of people that were arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.904" offset="7706937">Some 50 people sometimes and sometimes as many as a hundred people in these mass arrest situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.427" offset="7729089">Now, it was Richard Elrod who dreamed of the notion to later use the intimidation statute which didn't carry just a year in jail and would carry five years in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.609" offset="7777782">And when we as lawyers representing these people that were on this threat we beat him to the courthouse because we did not want anybody charged with a felony that carried five years for merely protesting in a peaceful way and trying to seek a readdress of their grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.646" offset="7845909">Now, the reason that the standing issue was not raised in the jurisdictional statement and the reason it just came up in the brief of these particular appellants is that there were several groups of people below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.400" offset="7900975">The state's attorney's office represented the defendants who were county officials and the corporation counsel's office represented the defendants who were city officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.155" offset="7944025">And Richard Elrod of course was the corporation counsel, the assistant in-charge of defending the city officials and it was Richard Elrod I tell you who dreamed up the intimidation statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.908" offset="7991045">So, the issue never came up because when the lawyers who tried the case and I'm one of the last of the 22 that are stuck with this case, we're in court with Mr. Elrod and with the other lawyers who represented the county officials, obviously, the issue never came up because we knew and everybody else knew that there was a substantial controversy about this intimidation statute that Mr. Elrod wanted to use it and we be in the court and the three-judge court agree that as the statute was perverted or could be read it was quite a chilling effect and had a chilling effect on First Amendment freedoms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.911" offset="8139003">Now, Mr. Bilton has so appeared and told you about taking money from somebody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.919" offset="8159065">I want to tell you how the statute was intended to be used and how you can read it and in plain English it would stick.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.663" offset="8194069">When you make a victim or a so-called a victim of that particular statute, a public official and then you read the statute that you will threaten him in order to get him to do something or to fail to do something by permitting a crime then I submit to you, you have to read the entire criminal code of the State of Illinois and also the ordinances of the City of Chicago and all of the other municipalities in the State of Illinois to determine whether or not they are threatening a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.362" offset="8340773">For example, as the three-judge court said, if you say to a public official, either you will readdress our grievances or we will picket the city hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.458" offset="8397197">Now, if there is an ordinance in the City of Chicago that prohibits the picketing of the city hall, you have just put yourself in a five-year nuisance to stand trial for the intimidation statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.398" offset="8448920">And that is why we are here and that is why the three-judge court said clearly, this statute as read and it can be read that way is a quite a chilling statute so far as First Amendment freedoms are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.710" offset="8502209">And the court itself went to several examples which I can quote if I can find the examples of people blocking an intersection with baby carriages or people deciding to do things which in and off themselves would be misdemeanors if carried through to fruition and because you've threatened to do a misdemeanor to bring a public official into the public forum to do what he should do then you are charged with a crime that carries with a five-year penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.269" offset="8640449">And I say to you that this statute on its face is void because it is over broad and as Your Honors got into the question with Mr. Bilton, there are many other statutes in the State of Illinois and many other ordinances of the City of Chicago which deal with conduct that may be antisocial or may create harm to property or to persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.089" offset="8755702">I say to you this is not such a statute as it is presently drafted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.227" offset="8776286">And another thing back on the standing issue, Mr. Elrod himself when he became a member of the legislature after the initial three judge opinion in this case entered into the state legislature and had passed a bill repealing this particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.032" offset="8867506">And I don't know today whether or not the governor has signed that Repealer Bill, but I do know that a letter was sent to the governor's office asking him to hold up on signing the repealer because it would moot the issues before the court today and I say to you that what we are doing here in this issue of statute --</text>

            <text syncTime="2953.774" offset="11918503">So, it is not moot, but the only thing I'm saying is that when you look at whether or not there is a case in controversy, I think you have to relax your standard so far as First Amendment cases are concerned because this Court has said and I think that we can't cross over this, that we are not really dealing so much with the people that want to break the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.095" offset="12027800">There are statutes on the books that are available to give these people their just rights and to put them in jail, commensurate with the crime that they have perpetuated in their actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.952" offset="12075133">But when they backup a step and say that when you use language and you verbalize your grievances open in a public forum and you address them to a public official and you say, "Do something for us please or we will do X" and it turns out that analysis of all the statutes they're been contemplating X is applied, that you're then subject to five years imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.341" offset="12192684">I say this runs smack down into what we are trying to start out with in this country of having truly conflicting interests balanced and I'm saying that they're always on a collision course that anytime that you take to the public forum and say, "Do something for us --"</text>

            <text syncTime="3061.585" offset="12349733">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.079" offset="12359659">I would like to at this point just digress and point out to Your Honors the problem I think that was bothering this particular Court and that is that I feel and I have a feeling that you have a fear of being inundated by this type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.407" offset="12429040">If you relax the standing required in a declaratory judgment action to the degree that we feel is necessary in order to protect First Amendment freedoms, but I would like to say two things and try to make this clear to the Court so that you understand it from really a practicing lawyer's point of view, one who is concerned with First Amendment freedoms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.410" offset="12529037">First of all, I would like to say to you what I feel would have happened had the state in this particular proceeding one to race to the courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.655" offset="12566026">Now, it has been called in many circles that this is the so-called race to the courthouse whether or not the state will file the charge or whether we will get to court and ask for declaratory judgment on these over broad statutes first in federal forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.009" offset="12623391">I like to say that this is from the lawyer's point of view, had the state in this particular proceeding won the race to the courthouse in addition to the complex, legal, and factual issues that I have had to address myself to hear, myself to hear over the last three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.047" offset="12691519">I would have then had to deal with in another forum also the issue of bail, the issue of defense in a criminal case, the issue of being prepared to try the case if it was not enjoined and also the anti-injunction statute in the federal system.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="3166.188" offset="12768110">Well, isn't that the normal course of litigation in the whole general scheme of things?.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ellis_e_reid" startTime="3171.045" stopTime="3532.139">
            <label>Mr. Ellis E. Reid</label>
            <text syncTime="3171.045" offset="12787545">Well, I'm saying it does not have to be for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.149" offset="12799979">We have a problem here and I think that the Court is trying to address itself to that problem because in Dombrowski and in Zwickler, this Court said that it would be enough to have a threat of arrest under the proper facts and circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.848" offset="12858807">And I detect from not only some of the questions today, but the previous time I argued this case that this Court also is dealing in its own mind with the floodgate problem and that is whether or not it should be inundated with this type of litigation if we're able to sit back in our office and go through the Criminal Code and say, "That's a good statute, that's a bad statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.013" offset="12943444">We'll file a suit on the bad statutes and then come to court."</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.016" offset="12955460">I don't think it's going to happen that way because these cases are expensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.253" offset="12972387">These cases are varietous and they take as you can see in this case three to four years of a lawyer's time and that's one issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.630" offset="13005928">But on the other hand, if the state wins the race to the courthouse and there is a threat and we have to wait even though they are threatening us like today to file a suit tomorrow and then we have to wait until tomorrow when suit is actually filed, then in addition to the complex problems in this type of case, in this federal forum I'm also put to the task of dealing with the complex legal and factual issues in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.393" offset="13112926">So, I'm saying to Your Honors that the floodgate argument that might be thrust upon you today will be found to be wanting in this particular type of case because it is a very burdensome type of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.131" offset="13159946">And number one, you must get one judge of a District Court to hear your case, look at your complaint and decide whether or not in his discretion he will convene a three-judge court as was done in this case and motions for this dismissal of your complaint may be found as they were found in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.332" offset="13236746">And I like to point out that these issues were met ahead on, on a motion to dismiss filed in this particular case and I'd like to in the time I have remaining address myself to four portions of the appendix which I think are important, which are four specific portions of the three-judge court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.127" offset="13315845">Now, at page 57 of the appendix the court said as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.035" offset="13347506">It said, "Plaintiff's filed their complaint on October 27th, 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.494" offset="13365373">Simultaneously, they moved that a three-judge court be convened to hear and determine the issues presented therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.878" offset="13390869">Shortly thereafter both the state and city defendants moved to dismiss, contending interalia that the complaint failed to disclose a basis for equitable relief and the adoption of federal abstention should be utilized to allow the state courts an opportunity to adjudicate the issues presented in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.104" offset="13459832">An opinion dealing with these motions was issued on December 28, 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.769" offset="13482402">The defendant's motion to dismiss were denied."</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.098" offset="13495777">Now, at page 62 of the same opinion, it's found on page 62 of the appendix, the court there said as follows, "The principles announced by the Supreme Court in Dombrowski and Zwickler appear clearly applicable in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.083" offset="13563695">Plaintiffs claim that statute is invalid because of vagueness, indebtedness and over breadth, have been used by defendants in furtherance of a scheme to discourage plaintiff's legitimate exercise of First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.223" offset="13612283">In Dombrowski, the court indicated that defense in a state criminal prosecution is not sufficient to correct either of these evils.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.329" offset="13644675">Arrest, detention, and threats of prosecution may have an interim effect on free expression where prosecutions are instituted in bad-faith in furtherance of a scheme to discourage protected activities, the ultimate success of the defendant does not alter the impropriety of the unconstitutional scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.431" offset="13733073">The adjudication simply resolves the guilt or innocence of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.443" offset="13749164">It does not purge the scheme of its impact upon federally protected rights."</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.269" offset="13772466">And then at page 94, the same court, the three judges continues and they say there, "The provision is not vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.211" offset="13828263">It is however over broad, I am speaking now of the particular statute, since it prohibits threats of insubstantial evil, the commission of criminal offenses against persons or property is a substantial evil and the state may legitimately proscribe the making of threats to commit such offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.382" offset="13896913">The commission of offenses against public order only however is not such a substantial evil that the state may prohibit the threat of it."</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.670" offset="13930036">And then they go on to deal with the statute to show examples as to how you can commit disorderly conduct and because of this statute end up with five years imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.992" offset="13979355">Now, back -- I'd like to go back on page 84 of the appendix, page 88 excuse me where the court points out this and I think this is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.045" offset="14027525">On page 88 and they say, "However, at the outset of this analysis it should be recognized that Illinois has no legitimate interest in proscribing as intimidation statements that have no reasonable tendency to coerce or statements which although alarming are not expressions of an intent to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.574" offset="14105684">Legitimate political expression intended to secure a changes in a society's legal, political, social, or economic structure frequently to take the form of expressions about future events or conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.433" offset="14161063">Such expressions may be in the form of promises, predictions, or warnings or threats of lawful action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.750" offset="14182379">And I know my time is up but I like to say here this is the trust of this particular statute that we contend as unconstitutional and because of that we feel this court has a duty to affirm the court below.</text>

            <text syncTime="3542.534" offset="14273494">Mr. Reid just said that in Illinois you can threaten to commit a disorderly conduct and wind up in prison for five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.414" offset="14312991">You can only do that in Illinois if you threaten to commit disorderly conduct while you are attempting to steal from a person or while you are attempting to rob from a person or why you are attempting to extort something from that person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.756" offset="14378402">Threats of disorderly conduct in the abstract are not prohibited by this statute or whatsoever because this is not a public order statute, this is the statute which protects the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.503" offset="14421347">Other than that I think that my argument in chief covered all the points that Mr. Reid talked about and I have no further rebuttal but just to respectfully request this Court to reverse the three-judge court below and restore the Illinois statute that we feel is very important in our scheme about Criminal Code.</text>
