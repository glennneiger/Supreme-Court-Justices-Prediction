            <label>Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="23.549" offset="197569">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.851" offset="214810">In certain respects, this case involves a rather narrow and somewhat technical issue of federal procedure but underlying it are some important questions that relate to notions of federal supremacy involving issues of importance to prison officials and to federal governmental officials generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.563" offset="329644">The issue in a nutshell is this, a federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.916" offset="359006">Section 1442 (a) (1) of Title 28 of the United States Code provides that suits against federal officers may be removed when brought in a State Court to a Federal Court where the acts that are alleged to have occurred about the basis of the suit occur when the officer is acting under “color” of his office.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.979" offset="499336">We've set the statute out at page 2 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.833" offset="522742">It provides important part as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.613" offset="537788">A civil action or a criminal prosecution commenced in a State Court against any of the following persons may be removed by them to the District Court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place wherein it is pending, one, any officer of the United States or any agency thereof or person acting under him for any act under color of such office.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.275" offset="668505">The issue arises here on the following facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.181" offset="692120">Respondent Daniel Morgan was a prisoner at the Federal Penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.274" offset="724511">He had been transferred there in March 1966 and in July 1966, some-four months later, filed the damage action which is the subject of this suit in a Kansas State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.369" offset="800893">Petitioners Willingham and Jarvis are the Warden -- and were then, Warden and Chief officer of the Federal Penitentiary at Leavenworth.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.035" offset="851466">They were the only named defendants in respondent Morgan's suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.891" offset="874977">There were 75 unnamed co-defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.394" offset="892949">He sought a total recovery of an excessive $90 million in damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.797" offset="922520">He alleged in some-10 counts a variety of tortuous acts that he said had been perpetrated upon him by petitioners Willingham and Jarvis and the other 75 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.839" offset="982706">In substance, his complaints can be boiled down to really two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.325" offset="1008724">He asserted that he had been inoculated with some dangerous foreign substance which had caused him to fall and injure himself and that, in the course of this inoculation, unauthorized people had been giving him medical assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.403" offset="1085001">And, in another count, he asserted in conclusory fashion that he had been beaten and assaulted and tortured in various respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.831" offset="1138709">Petitioners Willingham and Jarvis filed a general denial in the State Court denying all the allegations in the 10-count complaint that had been filed by respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.185" offset="1196074">They also filed, pursuant to Section 1442 (a) (1), a verified petition for removal of this action from the Kansas State Court to the Federal District Court for the District of Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.447" offset="1265142">In this removal petition, they asserted that, at all relevant times, they had been acting in their official capacities as Warden and Chief Medical Officer of Leavenworth Penitentiary and they set out the various counts of the complaint and then, at page 9 of the record, they said that Morgan is, and was at all times mentioned, a dully committed prisoner inmate of the Federal Penitentiary at Leavenworth and rather that any act or thing that these petitioners, or either of them, may have done or authorized to be done concerning Morgan, complained of by him, was done and made by them in the course of their duties as officers of the United States of America and as persons acting under officers of the United States of America and under color of such office and by virtue thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.578" offset="1509648">And, they again refer to their officers as the Warden and Chief Medical Officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.632" offset="1537860">Morgan then filed a motion in the Federal District Court to remand the case back to the State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.369" offset="1576835">He asserted for a variety of respects that petitioners were not acting under color of office when they committed the acts he alleged they had committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.350" offset="1628766">He also filed a rather extensive set of interrogatories on petitioner Willingham, directed in substantial part obtaining the names of the unnamed unidentified co-defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.661" offset="1698043">With the District Court's approval, an enlargement of time to answer these interrogatories was obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.505" offset="1733360">The next step was petitioners filing for a summary judgment in the Federal District Court on the ground that Morgan's suit should be dismissed under the so-called Official Immunity Doctrine which has been established by this Court as relating to executive officials as well as judicial and legislative officials in cases dating back to Spalding versus Vilas and going through Barr versus Matteo.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.130" offset="1875884">Petitioners, at that point, filed failry extensive affidavits which are set out at pages 44 and -- through 48 of the defendant appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.783" offset="1946520">Those affidavits detail their duties as Warden and Chief Medical Officer at Leavenworth and stated that the only contact that they had had with respondent Morgan was within the prison walls at Leavenworth and was in the course of their official duties as Warden and Chief Medical Officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.116" offset="2031888">Respondent Morgan opposed dismissal on a variety of grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.555" offset="2053622">The District Court in August of 1966 denied the motion of respondent Morgan to remand the suit to the State Court, finding that removal was proper under Section 1442 (a) (1) and writing a short opinion in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.316" offset="2148603">Subsequently, in December of 1966, the District Court granted petitioner's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.679" offset="2198131">In substance, the basis for the dismissal was the District Court's determination that the suit was covered by the Official Immunity Doctrine and that not only had it been properly removed, but that it was subject to dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.629" offset="2261870">Respondent Morgan then appealed to the Tenth Circuit from this judgment, and both parties frankly thought that the issue before the Tenth Circuit related to whether the District Court had properly determined that the requisite -- prerequisites for the Official Immunity Doctrine had been met and the case was briefed and submitted on the brief to the Court on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.652" offset="2377958">However, in deciding the case, the Tenth Circuit found it unnecessary to reach the question of whether the Official Immunity defense was properly invoked here.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.476" offset="2429262">Instead, it, although it started out by saying and spent most of its opinion by discussing the nature of interrelationship between the Official Immunity standard and the so-called color of office test for removal, it concluded that the District Court had erred in finding that the suit had been properly removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.461" offset="2525184">It said that “the color of office test for removal was much narrower,” and that's a quote from the Court of Appeals opinion, than the standard of Official Immunity and, therefore, it determined that the District Court did not have an adequate basis on which -- on the record that existed, on which to determine that removal was proper and it reversed the District Court's decision not reaching the Official immunity question and remanded for a factual determination, in its words, of the question whether removal was proper.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="648.498" offset="2697383">What was the issue that opened on remand?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="francis_x_beytagh_jr" startTime="653.985" stopTime="810.563">
            <label>Mr. Francis X. Beytagh, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="653.985" offset="2719326">As I understand it, the Court of Appeals said that the District Court needed a more adequate factual basis for making a determination as to removal and that is the issue that the Court -- the District Court has directed to address itself to on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.594" offset="2805739">The Court of Appeals did mention, in passing, that the -- quite curiously, that it thought that perhaps the standard for dismissal on the basis of Official Immunity might have been made out here but, nonetheless, it didn't feel that the standard of color of office for removal had been satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.089" offset="2903751">We brought the case here on petition for certiorari, which the Court granted, for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.264" offset="2948472">The case has great potential for substantial mischief if left standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.989" offset="2975326">There is, as respondent concedes, an obvious relationship between the Official Immunity Doctrine and the color of office test for removal when suits are brought against federal officers in State Courts, as often they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.838" offset="3046693">And, peculiarly, prison official such as are involved in this case can be subjected to harassment by bringing and having to defend against these kind of suits if the standard that the Court of Appeals has now erected is left standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.588" offset="3137703">So, we agree with the Tenth Circuit in only one respect, and that is that the question that must be considered is the interrelationship of the Official Immunity Doctrine and the color of office test under the removal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.188" offset="3212100">We think, however, that the Court of Appeals is manifestly wrong in concluding that the color of office test is narrower than the Official Immunity defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.915" offset="3251075">We think that simply stands the law in its head because the result of that is that any suit proper for removal would automatically be dismissible and Congress, therefore, would've done a rather empty act in proving a federal forum to do nothing but dismiss suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.742" offset="3326307">In effect, petition for removal would be an action to enjoin the suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1466.290" offset="5968541">One case is called Perez versus Bridal Hoover.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.694" offset="5982124">It was brought by Leander Perez down in Louisiana against federal voting examiners in a State Court, seeking to prevent them from carrying out the functions that Congress had charged them with carrying out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.334" offset="6036668">Now, they sought to remove that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.216" offset="6048266">The question there was whether they were acting under color of office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.837" offset="6066761">Now, if federal officials seeking to enforce laws like this are required to come forward with a substantial showing that they were acting within the scope of their official duties and the delay and the harassment in predictiveness that comes from that is permissible, then I think that there is a real mischief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.905" offset="6166967">Another case that the Court is familiar with is Norton versus McShane which came out of the Meredith incident at the University of Mississippi where suit was brought by individuals down in Mississippi against Marshall, McShane, and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.438" offset="6229138">There, removal was sought in the State Court and was granted, but if you read the statute narrowly and you can't obtain removal without a thorough-going extensive factual inquiry, then there is a real potential for mischief and hazard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.149" offset="6311999">We think the plain language of the statute itself supports our reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.959" offset="6327254">It says color of office.</text>

            <text syncTime="1598.789" offset="6498513">We think, on the facts presented and for the reasons developed in some length in our brief and in our reply brief, that this simply is not so and that if you say at least as to officials like these that they must do more than they've done here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1690.354" offset="6864750">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.097" offset="6879796">This is a rather unique case, in that, the respondent here would submit to the Court that the result reached by the Court of Appeals was quite correct but for the wrong reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.037" offset="6947506">As we've made clear in our brief, there is neither reason nor authority to support the views expressed by the Court of Appeals of the Tenth Circuit on the alleged interrelationship between the Immunity standards and the color of office test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.343" offset="7032769">However, we say that the Court was correct in reaching its result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.814" offset="7050637">We do not concede, as counsel has just stated, that the result was incorrect, and we say that for the reason that the record in this case was clearly inadequate, both under Section 1446 (a) of Title 28 of the Code and prior decision of this Court, clearly inadequate to support federal jurisdiction on removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.225" offset="7180309">If one fact stands out in this case, it is that the record is singularly to void effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.928" offset="7215104">The only uncontroverted fact in the record, as was pointed out by the Court of Appeals, is that, at all times, the only contact which the petitioners had with the respondent were within the walls of Leavenworth Prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.164" offset="7292008">In some of the case -- on the case which is cited by the Court involving automobile accidents, a -- the majority saw there was no color of office on the part of the driver of the automobile and, therefore, no removal -- excuse me, removability, a matter which is now corrected by the Federal Tort Claims Act giving removability under a different section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.511" offset="7405380">In none of those cases, however, was immunity involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.062" offset="7419591">Clearly, there's no immunity under Barr versus Matteo in the part of an automobile driver who was being charged with negligence is not exercising any sort of discretionary act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.788" offset="7478523">One case, Brown versus McBurnett, involving 1442 (a) (3), Court officials held there was a right of removability for two Deputy Martials who's transporting a federal prisoner to a penitentiary because they were in their performance of their duties under that section of statute and, clearly again, there was no immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.343" offset="7580714">Now, the question of, as the respondent sees it, the right of removability is oen which is conferred by statute and the requirements of the statute must be met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.160" offset="7640064">Congress did not see fit, if indeed it could do so, did not see fit to allow removability of every case or prosecution against a federal officer simply because he was a federal officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.548" offset="7701608">In the various sections of this statute, various tests are put down for the different categories of persons who are covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.226" offset="7740270">And, as a District Court case has said, Congress knew what it meant, knew how to say what it meant in these statutes, and they put down under color of office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.948" offset="7791156">This Court, Section 1446 (a) requires that the petition contain a claim and short statement of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.848" offset="7834728">We're not left, however, with that bear statutory requirement because this Court in two cases, Maryland versus Soper and Colorado versus Symes, where there was a far more detailed statement of facts than is present in this record, in both cases, held that the case should be remanded to the District Court -- to the State Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1984.283" offset="8040469">And here, as I understand it, the claim is that the very allegation that the only association between the defendant and the plaintiff was within the prison walls of Leavenworth Penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.056" offset="8115597">It goes far toward carrying the burden of showing color of office.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph M. Snee</label>
            <text syncTime="2008.234" offset="8136286">Well, Your Honor, that allegation was made first in the petition -- in the affidavit supporting the motion for salary judgment and was evidently cast in the terms of Barr versus Matteo, an immunity rather than removability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.776" offset="8214444">And, if it does not seem ficicious, I would say, not misinterpreting the mind of this Court in Barr versus Matteo, say that the outer perimeter of duties measured by the walls of Leavenworth Penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.940" offset="8299081">But, the only -- it's the only uncontroverted fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.121" offset="8311829">Now, in Maryland versus Soper, it was clear that the officers were present in the performance of their duty, but the -- this Court held that that was not sufficient because they had to show that they were doing nothing other than official duties at the time this homicide occurred, and they had not, by a candid specific positive statement if facts, given the Court a basis upon which to reach this determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.125" offset="8435858">Both the petitioners and the respondents engaged in the battle of conclusionary statements which will be inadmissible as evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.099" offset="8479744">Color of office is a conclusion of law which must be made by the Court on the basis of facts and submit it by the person who seeks removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.198" offset="8520182">And, the burden of proof is upon him, quite differently from the situations existed in Norton versus McShane where a conclusionary affidavit by the Attorney General that they were active within the performance of their duty was regard as efficient because, there, as in every case, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff, and he made no attempt to controvert this statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.533" offset="8629478">The fundamental error respondent submits was even comparing these two concepts of immunity and removability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.809" offset="8674617">They are different in origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.656" offset="8682036">They are different in purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.401" offset="8688933">They are different in test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.016" offset="8695411">They are different in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.250" offset="8704397">And, to try to compare the two of them is like asking is a horse better than a cow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.665" offset="8729997">It's a -- they belong to two different quarters, two different categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.505" offset="8745357">Each would stand upon its own two feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.305" offset="8760613">For the reason which have been suggested by the petitioners in their brief and after very careful analysis of the opinion of the Court of Appeals as distinguished from its judgment, I think it's incorrect to say that the removal power or removal test is far narrower than the immunity standard but, if for the same reasons, it's also incorrect to suggest as chasing too that the removal power is far more wider than.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.862" offset="8914840">They are in different quarters and different categories, and we've been told that the decision of the Court below puts the law on its head.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.168" offset="8956008">I would suggest to try to establish the jurisdiction of a Court under the removal statute by determining that immunity was present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.215" offset="8996237">It's put in the cart before the horse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.688" offset="9006164">And, we must have jurisdiction established before we enter into the immunity question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.534" offset="9037511">Now, the record in this case did not sustain that burden of proof which this Court has recognized.</text>
