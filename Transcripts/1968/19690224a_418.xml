            <text syncTime="42.491" offset="273324">I'm Paul Gish, Assistant Attorney General of Alabama representing Warden Simpson as the petitioner in the case of Simpson against Rice.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.571" offset="329644">In this case, Mr. Rice was convicted in 1960 of four separate cases of second-degree burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.896" offset="402996">It was seen on a plea of guilty in each case four years in one case and two years in each of the other three cases, making a total of ten.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.778" offset="498500">His plea of guilty was entered without aid of counsel to a post-conviction remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.264" offset="544475">He received a new trial some two-and-a-half years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.202" offset="576136">Our counsel was appointed for a new trial and he was tried I believe in December 1964, I think that's where I'm in, in two of the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.509" offset="645413">He was convicted by a jury, a second judge who passed an earlier sentence, gave him 10 years on each of those two convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.352" offset="716779">The next part in making a -- took Rule 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.417" offset="737050">The next point, he was tried on a third case, (Inaudible) case was convicted by a jury and the same judge sentenced him to five years imprisonment and this time, the time of the last trial, the state prosecuting officer with a motion to nisi prius for us before the case and that is what the trial did, fourth case was now before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.291" offset="932551">Now, this case if the Court please is similar of course to the North Carolina v. Pearce case.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.507" offset="989393">However, those who are summoned caucasians over argued by counsel that we don't have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.925" offset="1031084">Of course, this man did receive harsher punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.188" offset="1036100">He received much harsher punishment on the second trial than he did on the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.744" offset="1110392">He's not only did that but Your Honor I'm searching for word technically at least he received no credit for the two-and-a-half years served between the first convictions and his post convictions remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.195" offset="1232123">Now, our position is that the trial did as complete discretion to our sentence after a judgment of guilt having that complete discretion he uses many factors, some of which are connected with the crime itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.215" offset="1392201">Some of which may be connected with the man, some of which are -- can be connected with the issue of the case itself, some of which if the Court please depends upon how much the trial judge knows about this particular case at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.509" offset="1533367">In other words, on a plea of guilty, I have seen in the record that showed here what I've seen in years of good experience that all of the current cases in which the, I believe until May were doing the prosecuting officer and the accused that we will go -- entertain a plea of guilty if all of those that I have ever seen (Inaudible) that would not --</text>

            <text syncTime="528.284" offset="2216521">But what I'm saying my position is that the mere fact that he receives -- that the accused receives a harsher punishment and in this case in my judgment can be and should be contributed as much to other sentencing factors and not to give vindictiveness.</text>

            <text syncTime="651.314" offset="2708668">Now, my time is over, I shall ought in this case I can't argue all about our contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.770" offset="2766451">Let me point to a few things that are not in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.858" offset="2814830">In the Goolsby cases in which I have in the appendix to my brief on the merits and which was not reported throughout our brief, they've sentenced appropriate in 215 Seventh Circuit 598 and 602.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.258" offset="2928410">Now, those cases does need subsequent to the second conviction in this case of in essence that a man in Alabama cannot receive more punishment for one crime than the maximum provided by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.145" offset="3055992">Now, that is all that Alabama requires and frankly that is no way that I know of to give a man credit in Alabama on his prior conviction of the second case.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.338" offset="3172707">The legislature does not leave it to the present authorities receive a man with the judgment and sentence of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.803" offset="3258598">The present authorities have no discretion as to what to do with this man except to receive him and let him serve his term under the roof.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.733" offset="3326307">Now we do have “good time” and there are two types of good time which is the same as “gain time” of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.756" offset="3390360">Those things are figured by the present authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.527" offset="3417527">Now, if I may, let me get to the records in this case in the appendix on pages 55 and 56, we have as an exhibit to add if that's alright with this court, a statement by the prosecutor as to how he handles the second cases on retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.221" offset="3588263">Now, frankly I do not understand the statement of the District Court that flatly a key to the sta staf Alabama of increasing punishment, increasing sentences merely for punishment that in no evidence that I see in these records except the statement on which 55 and 56 and the statement by the petitioner below that he didn't know why he served or why he had to serve the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.019" offset="3831411">Now, of course I don't think that any convicted man could say why the judge gave him the maximum instead of the minimum is somewhat intriguing.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.864" offset="3946872">This Court I think can never held that this type of situation is similar-type situation involve double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.984" offset="4043316">The Court has held in Alabama from the beginning had also held that if a man is convicted of a lesser offense, he'd automatically acquitted of a higher offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.357" offset="4140805">In other words, if he were convicted of second-degree murder he cannot again be tried and convicted of first-degree murder but we should admit the difference between that situation and being convicted of first-degree murder for ten years on the one hand and on the second trial being convicted and getting a life of the same degree of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.666" offset="4354069">There is a case that's cited by the Circuit Court of Fifth Circuit reported on 403 F.2d 1019.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.106" offset="4427839">This is not cited in any of the briefs filed here before filed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.306" offset="4472560">Frankly, I do not -- I cannot from a constitutional standpoint understand this case to Williams against State of Alabama, this case in connection with the case before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.512" offset="4573393">In the Williams case, there were three convictions on first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.957" offset="4659179">Each sentence was for five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.950" offset="4679137">On the second trial, Mr. Williams was convicted by the jury and given ten years in one case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.800" offset="4742562">In the other two cases, he was given a year and a half which put him of course in a better position, the second time he was than in the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.774" offset="4806510">And I can tell you that he's in a better position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.178" offset="4836080">I have constitutionally if Mr. Rice was entitled to receive only what he did the first time with credit for time served and the District Court held then constitutionally why wasn't Mr. Williams entitled of the same treatment except that on the whole Mr. Williams got a better deal at the cases than Mr. Rice did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.232" offset="5020296">To me at a constitutional point, I do not understand that as a form of morality as a point of what should be known in a particular case, I can't understand it but in the constitutional point, if Mr. Rice has in the end of his year with no addition, then I submit that Mr. Williams is entitled of the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.694" offset="5178180">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1326.522" offset="5409416">At the evidentiary hearing in the District Court, the State of Alabama produced no witnesses, not a single person testified for the State of Alabama.</text>

            <text syncTime="1389.251" offset="5660400">We submit as the Honorable Attorney General of the State of Louisiana mentioned that this is a flagrant violation of Mr. Rice's constitutional rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="2454.087" offset="9919718">Well, I've already touched on I believe due process and the equal protection arguments, our double jeopardy argument we can attack in two concepts really.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.999" offset="9967365">One, you can carry forward this fictitious void doctrine that began in Stroud and some of the earlier cases as the Court did in Green.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.649" offset="10017938">And in that case, the Court held that that was an implied acquittal of the first-degree murder sentence when he was sentenced to second-degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.541" offset="10061511">We think that there's very little reason that it should not be carried all the way forward as they've done in California to apply the same logic and reasoning to the degree, not to the degree of the sentence but to the time in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.585" offset="10129742">Some states divide crimes up into many different degrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.307" offset="10144580">Others have only a very few but the end purpose of both is to fit the punishment to the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.372" offset="10172897">Now, the only argument made by the state in this case has been that this was on a plea of guilty and because of that that the state ought to have a second chance to look at it if the man decides to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.105" offset="10227754">But I think we have to carry it a little further and realize that it was on a plea of guilty when he was without counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.728" offset="10250324">At that time, the state's attorney has a duty owing to the state to see that he does not make an agreement that will be sole -- require smaller time in jail that the state would be jeopardized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.971" offset="10311241">If the state's attorney makes an agreement and it's adopted by the Court that it may well, it should represent what the state is going to require of this crime and we see no reason that the state is going to require of this crime and we see no reason that the state should have a second chance to look at this man, only this man not the others who may need their sentences reviewed just as much.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.580" offset="10413641">The other viewpoint of double jeopardy is the multiple punishment angle and this began in the case of Ex parte Lange some years ago and that is to look at double jeopardy as being more than one concept but having three different parts to it: retrial after conviction, retrial after acquittal, and multiple punishment for the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.357" offset="10516773">It may be that when this man appeal that he waived his right against a double jeopardy not to be retried but that does not mean that he necessarily waived his right to have that particular sentence fixed against.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.781" offset="10594513">I think that a lot of these arguments that we have made up here in Professor Van Alstyne's article in the Yale Law Review and I'd like to give some credit and mention to him because he probably should be the one before the Court today making the arguments in these cases --</text>

            <text syncTime="3181.310" offset="12828609">Then I am wondering was my hindsight has always been a lot better foresight but I guess it does, what if I had at the time of the habeas corpus hearing introduced the evidence in front of the judge and the prosecutor to let them explain why this was (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.500" offset="12957341">As I read -- as I read Judge Johnson's opinion even that were not have had my cause at that state of the game and I read the opinion and he said in the record and offered them the record on the second trial might show some reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.871" offset="13054830">Well, I couldn't conceive of no reason other than the fact as I said it earlier that the judge had the evidence before him the second tim and he accepted the plea of guilty on the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.774" offset="13138422">Now, would it be enough for the trial judge in stating the record at the end of the trial when jury convicts.</text>
