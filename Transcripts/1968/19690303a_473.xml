            <label>Mr. Harris Weinstein</label>
            <text syncTime="28.675" offset="218049">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.939" offset="235081">This federal income tax case comes to this Court on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.975" offset="275310">The issue involves the meaning of the words scholarship and fellowship grant which are used in Section 117 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.058" offset="323584">That section of the code allows the recipient to exclude the amount of scholarships or fellowships from his gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.287" offset="356498">That is it makes scholarships and fellowships tax exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.678" offset="378128">This case typifies a tax problem that seems to have arisen since the 1954 Code was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.380" offset="412923">At least, Congress in writing Section 117 in the legislative history showed no then awareness of this type of problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.534" offset="453465">It is basically this.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.120" offset="463809">It goes to the meaning of the words scholarship and fellowship in a commercial setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.054" offset="487633">Do those words encompass the situation where an employer gives his employee leave from his regular duties and continues the employee's regular salary or the greater part of it while the employee is taking a graduate degree on the subject matter of his employment, and at the same time, the employer obligates the employee to return to work for some specified minimum period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.828" offset="610722">The issue comes to the Court because of a split of authority among the lower federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.133" offset="635904">The Fifth and Sixth Circuits and the Court of Claims have each sustained treasury regulations tending to the view that payments made in this type of commercial setting are not scholarships or fellowships.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.930" offset="699120">The Third Circuit in this case has rejected those regulations has ruled that these payments are scholarship or fellowship and has reversed a jury verdict in favor of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.706" offset="758157">The precise problem comes out at payments that the Westinghouse Electric Corporation made to the three respondents before this Court at a time when those respondents were on leave, working on doctoral dissertations.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.427" offset="829106">These amounts were paid pursuant to program available to engineers and scientists employed at the Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory at Pittsburg, Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.560" offset="873618">That is a laboratory owned by the Atomic Energy Commission and most if not all of its activities seemed to be in the design of nuclear reactors for producing electric power.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.614" offset="917817">Westinghouse operates the laboratory under cost-plus contract with the Atomic Energy Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.468" offset="945194">In this particular program that we're concern with here, and I think it's typical of similar programs, is intended as a testimony here shows to meet the needs that Westinghouse and the A.E.C. have for highly trained technical people to help them recruit these people to keep them over a long period of time and to keep them up to date on technical requirements of their job.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.609" offset="1061804">The program that we're concerned with is broken into two phases.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.268" offset="1084479">The first one which is called the work-study phase has not given rise to any tax dispute, at least up to now.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.865" offset="1118856">At last for four years and it begins when the employee is accepted by Westinghouse into this Bettis program.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.548" offset="1157517">In the case of two of the respondents, that occurred when they agreed to work for Westinghouse with the third respondent that occurred sometime after he had come to work for Westinghouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.352" offset="1212792">During this four-year work-study phase, the employee holds down a regular job at the Bettis Laboratory and he attends classes part-time at either the University of Pittsburg or the Carnegie Institute of Technology, which I think since the events in this case, has become the Carnegie-Mellon University.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.189" offset="1292100">Westinghouse pays the employee for 40 hours a week, but allows him eight hours weekly up to I think a total of 156 hours each year to go to class.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.542" offset="1337553">Westinghouse pays his tuition fees during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.230" offset="1356257">At the end of this four-year period, employees are supposed to have met his preliminary requirements for the doctoral degree in engineering or science.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.967" offset="1395231">When all his course work, his language studies are finished and he's pass the qualification examinations for the doctoral degree, he applies for a leave of absence to work on his dissertation.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.724" offset="1454268">He receives a leave of absence if Westinghouse and the A.E.C. each approve the applicant, not all are approved, and if Westinghouse and the A.E.C. each approve his thesis topic which in the first instance approved by the University.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.975" offset="1527306">If he is granted leave, he then agrees to come back to Westinghouse for some --</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="361.488" offset="1549354">I beg your pardon.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.391" offset="1556982">Is it clearly understood that they will approve his dissertation subject only if it is connected with the work of this particular plant?</text>
            <text syncTime="374.882" offset="1602853">I think your brief indicates that.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harris Weinstein</label>
            <text syncTime="377.118" offset="1611839">I believe Justice Fortas that the testimony which is our call on this topic was of a representative of the A.E.C. was that they wanted the topic to be work connected.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.235" offset="1660322">Now, I think that has a broad scope and it certainly does not mean a topic of current use or of current concern to the laboratory, but I would suppose that it rather means a topic that by its nature helps the man learn better how to work on the problems at the laboratory.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="407.929" offset="1735137">But may I -- may I take it for granted and take it as not disputed that the dissertation topic is a topic that is of commercial interest to Westinghouse and official interest to A.E.C. in terms of its governmental assignment.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="429.950" stopTime="485.930">
            <label>Mr. Harris Weinstein</label>
            <text syncTime="429.950" offset="1823222">I think Justice Fortas, I'll go too far if I said that it was of immediate commercial value at the time that is was performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.771" offset="1854464">It may or may not be, and I think that work connected was used in the somewhat more general sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.197" offset="1888110">Of the topics here were chosen by in this case were chosen by the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.609" offset="1913814">They were generally related to the area of interest which I think were the areas were the respondents had worked generally speaking before taking their leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.369" offset="1960835">The topics were approved by the A.E.C. and Westinghouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.832" offset="1974732">There is apparently precedent for disapproval but it did not happened with any of these three respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.381" offset="2020916">Now in return for the this leave, the respondent agrees to return for a -- to Westinghouse at that is for a minimum period --</text>

            <text syncTime="485.930" offset="2047143">Let's say on page -- excuse me, but on page 3 of your brief and this is what it caught my eye.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.646" offset="2077968">You say each applicant must be approved then the topic of his proposed thesis.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.286" offset="2104508">It is reviewed to ensure that it is relevant to the work program of the laboratory, relevant to the work program of the laboratory.</text>

          <turn speaker="harris_weinstein" startTime="510.105" stopTime="593.734">
            <label>Mr. Harris Weinstein</label>
            <text syncTime="510.105" offset="2143796">I think Justice Fortas that if there is a vagueness there; it is a vagueness that reflects the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.731" offset="2174307">This record did not involve any topics that had been disapproved, denied beyond inquiring whether there was approved or whether there had ever been any instances of disapproval.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.463" offset="2221223">I do not believe there was any inquiry into what might leave the A.E.C. and Westinghouse to disapprove a particular contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.288" offset="2248495">And I don't want to suggest that the topics were viewed for immediate commercial benefit at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.546" offset="2289560">This minimum period of obligation after the leave was in the case of two respondents here, two years, and the case of the third, who came under an earlier version of the same program, he was committed to return to Westinghouse for one year after his leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.521" offset="2357478">During the leave, Westinghouse pays all tuition and fees, and those amounts are not in dispute here.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.287" offset="2388511">They have not been taxed and there is no contention that they should be taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.589" offset="2405752">The dispute goes to an amount that is paid calculated on the basis of prior salary and family size, and it ranges from 70% to 90% of prior salary, depending the low end, a single man at the high end demand with the wife and two or more children.</text>

            <text syncTime="599.836" offset="2502719">I suppose Justice White there could be a variety of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.476" offset="2513272">It might just be an inducement to be done with his work and come back as soon as possible.</text>

            <text syncTime="613.772" offset="2558412">The record bears on that indirectly and showing that Westinghouse on advice of their tax counsel withheld taxes from this portion of the benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="632.401" offset="2633017">Well, certainly, the record doesn't show that it was an anticipation of tax consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.740" offset="2654333">Now, this program is typical, yet the payments might not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.791" offset="2674500">For example, the federal government sends a good number of civilian and military employees to school, many of whom study for degrees, and these people received their full salaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.746" offset="2730402">Now, I think it rather hard to distinguish and defining a scholarship or fellowship between whether a man gets a 100% of his salary or 90% of one of the respondent -- as one of the respondents did here.</text>

            <text syncTime="966.532" offset="3969546">First, that we don't understand that that's ever been the any -- be accepted understanding of those words in any place, which would lead us to think that if Congress had meant that rather unusual distinction it would've been more direct than saying so.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.084" offset="4039659">And the -- I think the other answer really comes down to why these regulations exist and perhaps I ought to turn to those because this case I think focuses on the validity of these regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.477" offset="4101308">The statute really has no definition, the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.321" offset="4120639">You're left on the statute I think to infer from why the statute was adopted and what Congress said about it how this sort of case ought to be resolve, and the treasury which has general rule in making power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.337" offset="4188766">It sought to use that power to fill what is really an interstice in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.532" offset="4209455">And these regulations that the treasury has adopted were accepted by the controlling legal theory as a controlling legal theory by the district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.218" offset="4248221">They form the basis for instructions, for rulings on evidence and they -- and for that reason, I think that the basis for the regulations is the heart really of this case, and if those regulations are reasonable, if they're rational interpretations of the statute, then we would suggest that the treasury has properly exercise its power and drawing or rather hard line in what we would agree as a rather hard case of statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.648" offset="4377997">And if I -- these regulations if I can turn to their language, start out with a general definition that says generally speaking that a scholarship is an amount paid to allow student to pursue studies, a fellowship, to allow a student to pursue studies or research.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.451" offset="4481128">And if the regulations stop there, this case wouldn't have arisen because these payments would have qualified.</text>

            <text syncTime="1146.155" offset="4688018">I think the reason is that an individual could be either; it could be a student or a non-student.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.978" offset="4711320">I don't believe that these regulations were intended in that subparagraph C to not apply to a student but rather the word individual was used to encompass student as well as somebody who is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.659" offset="4770043">And I think that that would agree with the general understanding of fellowship which might be to a graduate student or might not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.674" offset="4810062">The exceptions which are also set out in our appendix to these general definitions are twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.680" offset="4842141">One says that a scholarship or fellowship does not include amounts that represent compensation for past, present, or future employment services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.627" offset="4889893">And the second says that a scholarship or fellowship does not encompass amounts that are paid to finance study or research undertaken and the words are primarily for the benefit of the grantor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.166" offset="4947989">Now, both of these exceptions represent generalizations of concerns or the Congress evidence or things that Congress did when it was drafting this part of the revenue code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.883" offset="5014862">This part of the code was a direct response to some very specific problems that the treasury had in years preceding 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.585" offset="5069720">And these were how to treat amounts of paid research and teaching assistance and how to treat foundation grants to the nonstudent, often a -- an established research or a professional who wanted to continue his area of activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.902" offset="5135026">The only way of doing this before 1954 was to apply concepts of gift, and 39 Code is now if a gift was intended, the amount was not taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.556" offset="5185599">Now, the difficulty with this was that it was a rather anomalous approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.747" offset="5202317">As things worked out, the foundation grant to an established professional which is of reasonably substantial amount of proceeds from what could be called the disinterested generosity, so, it is a gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.178" offset="5260100">The small amounts paid graduate students who are required to teach or do research are pay to an employee, so those are taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.576" offset="5297716">This is a sensible interpretation of gift, but in terms of tax policy in terms of what one might want to exempt or not exempt is questionable whether this make sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.613" offset="5345782">It was against this background at Section 117 was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.485" offset="5365321">It has in its first sections, 117 (a), a general exclusion to amounts paid as scholarships or fellowships.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.621" offset="5405863">Then Section 117 (b) expressly deals with these two problems, 117 (b) (1) deals with the research assistant or teaching assistant, and it expressly provides that amounts paid to that type of person are to be taxed unless that person is performing duties for example practice teaching that it require of all candidates for the degree including those of course who would not have fellowships or scholarships.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.486" offset="5541282">Now, in drafting these provisions, Congress set two things, and the parts of the regulations that we're concerned with here represent generalizations of what Congress set.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.147" offset="5595930">In dealing with the nondegree candidates in establishing this $300.00 per month exclusion, both houses of Congress in their Committee Reports said that they did not intend to grant exclusions for amounts that could fairly be called continuing payments of salary during a period when the recipient is on leave from his regular job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.008" offset="5719437">That's the language of the House Report; it is essentially repeated in the Senate Report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.800" offset="5746604">And the House did this on the context of a -- an objective formula which have would have excluded fellowships only if the fellowship grant and the employee's compensation from a prior employer were less than 75% of its prior salary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.230" offset="5824240">The Senate changed the formula, but expressed the same general idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.516" offset="5853393">And the reason the Senate changed the formula does not bear on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.070" offset="5871679">It's because it was called to the Senate's attention that certain people for example, people who just got a medical degree and we're giving -- being given a fellowship would under the House formula had been taxed because they had no real income before they started on their research or post-doctoral fellowship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.745" offset="5950360">Now, the part of the regulation, this -- excludes from the fellowship or scholarship compensation for past, present or future services, we suggest has its direct antecedent in this aspect of the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.793" offset="6018591">Congress was quite clear that it did not want to exempt payments of salary while the recipient is on leave from his regular job, and we suggest that in this part of the regulation, the treasury is quite directly implemented that expression of congressional concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.259" offset="6088391">The second part of the regulation which speaks of the primary purpose of the grant comes out of the legislative history of Section 117 (b) (1) which taxes amounts pay to teaching and research assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.799" offset="6170520">Now, that exemption does not apply if the teaching or research is required of everybody who is a candidate for the degree, even if he doesn't have a scholarship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.595" offset="6217749">In Congress in explaining that dichotomy said that it was drafting the statute so that it would not tax a grant which involves research or teaching services perform primarily for the training and education of the recipient, so that the second exclusion of the regulations finds its direct antecedent and not portion of the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.659" offset="6338017">So what we have is a treasury attempt to synthesize and give expression to the general concerns that Congress showed in drafting this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.746" offset="6398307">There are several arguments made against this, both by respondent and by the court below which I'd like to deal with very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.630" offset="6437909">Congress said that it was trying to avoid a case-by-case inquiry into the existence of gift, and from this, it's been suggested and argued that Congress was trying to avoid a case-by-case inquiry into anything, even compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.357" offset="6508753">We find no support for that in the legislative history, none has ever been cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.845" offset="6530800">Congress on rather make clear that it did not want to let compensatory or bargain for arrangement escape tax, and this is the effect of the treasury regulations as to support that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.165" offset="6588061">The second point which I think is really at the basis of the Third Circuit opinion here is the view that Congress in Section 117 wanted to do everything it could to encourage education, and that the interpretation rendered below encourages education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.573" offset="6657651">What is true that Congress wanted to encourage education through certain tax incentives, but that is not the function of Section 117.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.335" offset="6696730">Congress has attempts to encourage education are in other parts of the code in Section 501 which establishes tax -- allows tax-free foundations in educational institutions, and in Section 117 which allows deductions for donations to that sort of organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.820" offset="6770604">Neither of these bear on this case which is a commercial enterprise arises in a commercial setting in a bargain for arrangement.</text>
