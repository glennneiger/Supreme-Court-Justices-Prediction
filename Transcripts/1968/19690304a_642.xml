            <text syncTime="25.205" offset="204152">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.457" offset="221184">I represent Edward Boykin Jr. who is the only man in America that awaits execution for the crime of common law robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.422" offset="269040">And if he is permitted to die will be the sixth man to be executed by the State of Alabama in almost 40 years for that crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.510" offset="313448">This case is before this Court on certiorari to the Supreme Court of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.378" offset="344900">That court by a four to three decision affirmed five death sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.288" offset="372485">Edward Boykin was brought to trial on five separate indictments for robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.912" offset="402996">And a plea of guilty was entered and on that plea he was sentenced to death five times.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.178" offset="448136">Now, this case as I see it raises three great constitutional issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.070" offset="479692">The first one is that it violates the Constitution, the Due Process Clause for a conviction to be based upon a plea of guilty where in the record of trial there is no affirmative showing that that plea was voluntarily and understandingly given.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.647" offset="569971">Secondly, the imposition of the death penalty for the common law robbery violates the provision of the cruel and unusual Eighth Amendment clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.707" offset="634232">And thirdly, a statute which allows a jury unfettered discretion in a capital case violates the petitioner's right to due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="346.498" offset="1489377">I might explain to the Court here that I'm in the same position you all are because I entered this case at the trial -- at the appellate level.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.307" offset="1528560">I was -- I was not even in the case until after the sentence was given and everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.607" offset="1561788">Now, addressing myself, if I may to this point that the Due Process Clause requires that a trial record show affirmatively that the plea of guilty was voluntarily and understandingly made, I think there are three points of reasoning that inevitably draw us to that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.825" offset="1658650">The first is and I don't think it's arguable that a plea of guilty must be voluntarily and understandingly made.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.514" offset="1697416">That's because as we -- I think we all realize that a plea of guilty is an admission of guilt.</text>

            <text syncTime="409.301" offset="1740570">And certainly the waiver of such a fundamental right to contest guilt to give the prosecution the whole vote so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.357" offset="1792815">The waiver of that right is so fundamental that I don't think it's arguable.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.883" offset="1826879">That it should be voluntarily and understandingly given.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.599" offset="1841716">Now secondly, that in order to be meaningful, it must be affirmative.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.126" offset="1867839">And this affirmative procedural step must appear on the record because -- what I'm saying here is this, that if you look at this record right here, you do not know and I do not know whether Edward Boykin entered his plea of guilty voluntarily and understandingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.858" offset="1966791">And yet he is going to have to die because of the barrenness of this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.563" offset="1993644">And it's a simple thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.576" offset="2005661">It -- by analogy it's the same reasoning that this Court used in the Miranda decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.280" offset="2036485">There, there was a question of a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.222" offset="2052263">There was a -- and this Court said that if a -- in a trial court, if you're going to introduce an out of court confession then you -- then the record must affirmatively show that that confession was obtained voluntarily and understandingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.952" offset="2139199">The -- the same thing is true that we are asking here.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.881" offset="2162918">If you're going to rely on a plea of guilty then the record ought to show and -- we wouldn't have this trouble right here.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.618" offset="2209834">This question wouldn't be before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.034" offset="2219551">It wouldn't give the trouble to the Supreme Court that it gave them if a -- as -- the same sort of litany that -- that's in the record about indigency.</text>

            <text syncTime="1036.165" offset="4248012">Now, this is a direct attack upon Title 14, Section 415 of the Code of Alabama which is the penalty statute for the common offense of robbery and we all know that the common law offense of robbery is the its essential's elements are the taking of property with -- from a person with the violence or with a threat of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.502" offset="4361383">Now, the attack on this statute is because the breadth and range of it, a simple assault with a larceny can give you the death penalty under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.387" offset="4436929">Now, in application of this provision of the Eighth Amendment, this Court has indicated certain standards or certain things that they look at.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.074" offset="4495653">One of them is that it's not a static concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.675" offset="4510072">That's its not a non-progressive thing that it moves with the times and that they've in -- even indicated -- you have even indicated in an -- a more enlightened society, it might encompass greater and greater things and I am saying to this Court today that Alabama is the only State that has this common law offense of robbery with the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.850" offset="4634728">And I submit that in the light of this Court's decisions, decisions such as Weems 60 years ago when this Court knocked down a punishment where a feller -- he falsified some Government documents and he got 12 years imprisonment and loss of his civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.653" offset="4749981">This Court at that time 1910 said that that one of the standards is the disproportionate, disproportionality of the offense with the punished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.898" offset="4814973">Now, looking directly at Alabama, Alabama -- the crime of unpremeditated murder with malice in Alabama, the maximum punishment is life imprisonment yet for larceny, and a simple assault, you can get the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.182" offset="4912149">I respectfully submit that that this standard of disproportionality is applicable to Edward Boykin.</text>
