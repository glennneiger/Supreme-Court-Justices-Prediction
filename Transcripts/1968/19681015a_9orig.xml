            <text syncTime="44.066" offset="279594">But I was wondering if you could tell us number one, in a very few brief word what your litigation is about?</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="53.814" offset="318673">And secondly, to what extent are you relying on my vain protest in the Circuit California case to sustain your case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_b_miller" startTime="66.481" stopTime="168.801">
            <label>Mr. J. B. Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="66.481" offset="369246">I'll answer the first question Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.425" offset="381053">As you know this Court held in the first Louisiana case that Louisiana owned none of the marginal sea that our title stopped at the inland water -- at the inland waters that we own the inland waters under the doctrine of Pollard versus Hagan, and Pollard versus Hagan was in that case and in the California case limited to inland waters with the result we owned nothing beyond inland waters none of the territorial sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.991" offset="495365">Following that, Congress passed his Submerged Land Act by which they confirmed and granted to the states a three-mile belt of marginal sea lying outside of its inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.121" offset="551894">The -- it not only confirmed the grant to the three-mile belt but in cases where the state's boundary, historic boundary extended beyond three miles it confirmed it out to its historic boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.989" offset="603303">The second Louisiana case held that we did not have a historic boundary extending three leagues that we had contended.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.012" offset="635382">Although, this Court held and the Government conceded in that case that we did on the islands within three leagues of the coast and that we also owned the water between those islands and the shore because they were so situated as to enclose inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.338" offset="700688">Now, this case is to determine where the limit of the inland waters of Louisiana are, the inland waters that belong to this state under Pollard versus Hagan.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.853" offset="738826">And once we determine where the inland waters are, then we measure three miles outside of those inland waters for purposes of the Submerged Lands Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="185.942" offset="847182">We may not agree with that but that was the holding of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.211" offset="868185">Now, if you will remember this case -- this Court in the Texas case and in the Florida case awarded both Texas and Florida their historic limits, Texas goes out three leagues, Florida goes out three leagues but Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana were brought into their shores into their inland water.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. B. Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="262.960" offset="1155218">We filed an alternative motion asserting an alternative coastline primarily in our position of the restrictive and narrow interpretation of this Convention that the Justice Department put on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.791" offset="1194506">They have come up with a line for Louisiana's inland waters that's virtually a shoreline.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.534" offset="1213524">And it's my purpose to point out to this Court that even -- that whether or not you accept the inland water lines and Mr. Sachse advocates there's no justification for the line that the Government continues.</text>

            <text syncTime="303.261" offset="1316446">Yes sir, to a great extent Mr. Justice to great extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.387" offset="1332955">We feel that the shores of the Gulf of Mexico and particularly Louisiana are so shallow, there's so changing.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.319" offset="1368691">There's no way the foreign commerce or any ocean going commerce to go anywhere in Louisiana because of the shallow waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.324" offset="1396694">We've had the dredged channel, the United States Government spent over $300 million dredging channels in to the ports of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.983" offset="1427310">There could be no commerce, they would be no port but for these dredged channels, this is a gently sloping shore, it is of no value at all to foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.228" offset="1464299">And we feel that these are factors that this Court must take into consideration in determining what are the inland waters of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.956" offset="1519156">Now, I have already alluded to the disagreement between the Government and I say that was the interpretation of the Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.552" offset="1549563">Louisiana takes the position that the Convention is a general document that it could not possibly be held to cover every complexity and every detail of every coast in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.330" offset="1592717">We think it's like the United States Constitution and that -- it must be interpreted liberally in order to make it work.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.121" offset="1619884">The Government on the other hand said we've got to stick to the letter of that document that we can't go beyond its four corners and where it silent it is prohibitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.321" offset="1660635">It denies to us principles of international law that are well established.</text>

            <text syncTime="402.694" offset="1714134">For example, the Convention is silent on whether or not islands may be used to form that perimeter of bays or to enclose inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.327" offset="1752691">The Government takes the fact position that that means it is prohibitive that we may not use islands to enclose inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.918" offset="1782993">Yet, in every single instance of every bay that they have recognized along our coast they do in fact used islands to form the perimeters of those bays.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.506" offset="1825416">As a result of this type of narrow interpretation of this Convention, the Government has arrived of what we consider as shoreline.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.592" offset="1861778">It has changed the status of the inland waters of Louisiana from inland to the high seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.617" offset="1889886">It's changed the status of the inland waters which have been recognized by this Court to be inland.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.008" offset="1923427">A typical example of this is in Chandeleur and Breton Islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.928" offset="1951117">These waters are enclosed by the Chandeleur Island and by Breton Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.638" offset="1981942">The Government concedes -- now, listen to this, the Government concedes that these waters are inland but they say that they're inland only because of the concessions they made in this prior case where they admitted and conceded when we were arguing for a three-league limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.764" offset="2054457">They admitted that all of the island within three leagues with the territory of Louisiana and that all of the waters between the islands and the mainland was so situated as to enclose inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.723" offset="2102314">This Court recognized this in the first Louisiana case and pointed out that these waters had become vested in Louisiana at the time it was admitted into the union and our territory under the adoption of Pollard versus Hagan.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.221" offset="2160306">In the California case, this Court again recognized that these waters were inland.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.455" offset="2181204">It distinguished them from the Santa Barbara Channel which the Court had held connected two areas of the open sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.563" offset="2209625">In distinguishing these waters from the Santa Barbara Channel, it pointed out that Breton Island was a cul-de-sac that Chandeleur Island led only to Breton island if it led anywhere that neither served as a route of passage between two areas of the open sea and both was so shallow as to be navigable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1078.757" offset="4418435">But Article 7 also requires that the area of the bay must be at least equal to the area of a semicircle, the diameter of which is a closing line of the bay.</text>

            <text syncTime="1622.258" offset="6592449">East Bay had a greater penetration than depth of penetration than ever before but for the first time its entrance exceeded 10 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.910" offset="6622960">At that time, international law said, you draw a 10-mile line at the close -- at the nearest point within the bay which does not exceed 10-miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.061" offset="6671653">South Pass and southwest Pass have continued to grow, they're still growing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.063" offset="6691610">In 1958, when the Convention was adopted this was a configuration of East Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.316" offset="6716688">It was still a bay.</text>

            <text syncTime="1658.288" offset="6736541">It is long since then and the next map shows the 1968 depth of penetration and width at the bay.</text>

            <text syncTime="1685.264" offset="6844479">It certainly had sufficient depth of penetration.</text>

            <text syncTime="2158.643" offset="8737938">We've shown that East Bay has qualified geographically as inland waters of this nation since 1803 in the Louisiana Purchase and since then Louisiana was admitted to the union in 1812.</text>

            <text syncTime="2200.838" offset="8906689">Now, Mr. Sachse has already discussed the Act of 1895 as a basis of the inland water line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.879" offset="8930931">The Government has objected to this and contends that this Act is limited to navigation that it have no effect whatsoever but anything else except navigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2229.625" offset="9021837">Now, freedom of navigation is the first freedom mentioned in the Convention on the high seas, no nation may regulate navigation on any part of the high seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.957" offset="9063215">To do so, it can only justify it on the basis that it is claiming those waters as it's very own.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.618" offset="9097801">Now, Mr. Sachse has pointed ut that prior to 1895, Congress had adopted the international rule for the prevention of collisions on the sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.435" offset="9137089">These rules applied not only to the high seas, they also applied to the marginal or territorial sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.337" offset="9168750">Subsequent acts of Congress, treaties and the case of the Delaware make this clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.402" offset="9189021">The international rules applied to the high seas and the territorial seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.977" offset="9207306">The Act of 1895 imposed the inland rules only upon inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.565" offset="9233638">But it imposed the inland rules upon all vessels, foreign as well as domestic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.665" offset="9254013">It says that all vessels must comply with the inland rules once they get into the inland waters and it authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to designate and define a line marking those inland waters to carry out the purposes of that act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.873" offset="9322872">Now, the reason for the designation of this line by the Secretary of the Treasury, the reason for it was of course to regulate navigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2323.438" offset="9397164">Now, in 1895 immediately after the passing of the statute, the Secretary of Treasury began his test of designating and defining these lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.098" offset="9435721">He picked the most important areas in the United States for his first lines in 1895.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.869" offset="9458813">He included Philadelphia Harbor and Delaware Bay, Baltimore and Chesapeake Bay, New York, Charleston, Savannah, Mobile and New Orleans and the Delta of the Mississippi River.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="3711.832" offset="14950693">Mr. Justice Black, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.580" offset="14965739">I think it will be helpful in the beginning if I go back to the fundamental question in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.578" offset="15001684">As we see it, the ultimate question is, where is the coastline of the United States located in the general area of Louisiana for the purposes of the Submerged Lands Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.401" offset="15060929">The exact location of the coastline is important because the Submerged Lands Act confirmed to each state, the title to the resources not only up to the coastline but also for three miles beyond.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.184" offset="15128116">And consequently while we're fighting about where the line is three miles beyond the coastline that is necessary determined by the location of the coastline itself and it's more convenient to talk directly about the location of the coastline.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3773.702" stopTime="3779.285">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="3773.702" offset="15198229">And you think of that as the coastline of the United States rather than the coastline of Louisiana, do you?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="3779.285" stopTime="4008.414">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="3779.285" offset="15220485">We say that the coastline for the purposes of the Submerged Lands Act means the coastline of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.278" offset="15248488">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.415" offset="15269073">The two -- the two would be the same for all purposes that so far as I can think but we do mean for international purposes Justice Stewart and that's why I emphasize the coastline of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.605" offset="15333752">Now, Section 2 (c) of the Submerged Lands Act defines the coastline as the line of ordinary low water along the coast which is indirect contact with the open sea and the line marking the seaward limit of inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3826.791" offset="15410552">There's no dispute of course about first part of the definition in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3831.659" offset="15429987">That is to say the low water marked along the coast where the coast is in contact with the open sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3839.502" offset="15461334">Although, Louisiana denies that their coast is ever in contact with the open sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.779" offset="15490487">The critical question then is about the second part of the definition in 2 (c) of the Submerged Lands Act whereas the line marking the seaward limit of inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3861.755" offset="15550360">In other words, what are the inland waters of Louisiana and where is their seaward limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3870.435" offset="15585155">Now, in answering this question, the first step is to determine where one finds the definition of inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3879.777" offset="15622457">Where one finds the standard that he applies to the physical features of this coast in order to find the inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3888.240" offset="15656312">Our view is that you find it in the convent -- Geneva Convention of 1961 defining the territorial sea and the adjacent waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3900.586" offset="15705736">Louisiana's answer is that you find it -- our first answer is that you find it in the regulations issued by the coastguard for the purpose of telling vessels where they are to follow the international rules in navigation and where they are to follow our own domestic inland rules of navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.034" offset="15791522">The difference is our illustrator on this chart and also on the small charts which I believe the clerk has handed to each member of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3936.021" offset="15847424">The green area is the area that was confirmed to the United States by the decree entered late in 1965 a supplemental decree which was virtually by consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3951.817" offset="15910640">In other words, it is the area more than three miles from the coastguard line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3959.121" offset="15939897">The red areas here, a little bit here and then a bit over here and another area in East Bay are the areas that were confirmed to Louisiana by the supplemental decree entered in late in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="3980.117" offset="16023803">The pink area we concede goes to Louisiana, there's no dispute about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3990.203" offset="16064136">Consequently, one comes down on to the white area between green and the pink or red, this long strip in here, sometimes 20 miles of the physical coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="4005.879" offset="16126934">The dispute is over that area.</text>

            <text syncTime="4358.275" offset="17536502">As I say, I plan to deal first with the coastguard line and then second was that of the more specific disputes as I have tied to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4368.722" offset="17578297">With respect to the coastguard line, we urge first that United States against California should be decisive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4378.246" offset="17616332">There, the Court held that Congress used the terms “coastline” and “inland waters” in the international sense as in it had used to be in prior decisions of this Court notably the first California case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4395.055" offset="17683623">Second, that Congress intended the Court to fill out the meaning of inland waters in coastline by choosing the best in those practicable definitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4406.872" offset="17730853">And then third, the Court held that the best and most practical definition where those in the Geneva Convention ratified by the United States in 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="4417.895" offset="17774947">Now, those three rulings seem to us dispositive of the issue of these white areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4427.545" offset="17813504">Louisiana argues as I understand it that the decision in the California case was merely sort of permissive, a state could assert a right out to the line fixed under the Convention or it could if it wish assert a line out under some other set of rules going beyond the Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="4451.782" offset="17910471">That seems to us to be inconsistent of both with what the Court said in the California case and also inconsistent with what it actually did in its decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="4466.350" offset="17968776">In the California case, on page 165 of 381 U.S., the Court said it is our opinion that we best fulfill our responsibility by giving content to the words which Congress implied that's of course implied in the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4484.531" offset="18041501">By imply -- adopting the best and most workable definitions available the Convention provides such definitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4493.329" offset="18076714">We adopt them for the purposes of the Submerged Lands Act then the Court went on to point out, this establishes a single coastline both for the fenestration of the Submerged Lands Act in the conduct of our future relation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4508.023" offset="18135437">This certainly doesn't sound permissive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4510.302" offset="18144632">It establishes a single coastline where you adopt this definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4515.013" offset="18163440">It doesn't sound as if they were to be used on some occasions and then not on others if the state happened to prefer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4522.411" offset="18193011">And of course the Court later on its opinion rejected California's claim to Santa Monica Bay and to San Luis Obispo Bay on the ground that they did not conform to the requirements of the Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="4540.090" offset="18263751">So, that it applied it both where it heard us as some of you will recall in Monterey Bay and it applied the Convention too where it heard California as in San Luis Obispo Bay and Santa Monica Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="4556.948" offset="18331146">When it came to the decree which the Court entered following the decision in the California case, it being on the original document, the decree were cited as used here in inland waters means I emphasized the “means”, means what is landward of the baseline of the territorial sea which are now recognized as internal waters of the United States under the Convention on the territorial sea and the contiguous zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="4591.642" offset="18469909">The word “means” surely suggests that there were no alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="4596.371" offset="18488822">Furthermore, on the next paragraph of the decree where the Court listed certain waters that it adjudicated to be inland waters of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="4606.175" offset="18528110">It used the word that the inland waters of California include specific areas that were in litigation in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4614.953" offset="18563218">Obviously, it didn't wish to prejudge California's claim as to areas we didn't talk about in that case are belonged to northern part of the coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="4624.104" offset="18599790">I think again the contrast between “includes” in this paragraph and “means” in the other paragraph emphasizes that the word “means” when adopting a general formula was deliberate and indeed at least the “includes” point was pointed out in the supplemental briefs of the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="4649.919" offset="18703026">Louisiana's other argument as I understand it is that United States against California does not apply because her coast has unique features.</text>
            <text syncTime="4661.624" offset="18749837">Of course the characteristics of all the coasts in states are in some degree peculiar.</text>
            <text syncTime="4668.485" offset="18777318">The Alaska coast is entirely unlike the North Carolina coast or the Maine coast is entirely unlike the Louisiana coast, Connecticut coastline would be quite different from Oregon's and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="4684.517" offset="18841475">If one said that a state may get out from under the Convention simply by calling attention to particular characteristics, then every state's coastline is drawn off with litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4698.748" offset="18898317">The very purpose of the California case to have the same coastline for international purposes and for the purposes of the Submerged Lands Act would be defeated and the Court and the Congress indirectly, I suggest, would be put in the position of playing favorites among the states as it used the Convention rules in one case and some other set of rule and another.</text>
            <text syncTime="4726.423" offset="19009076">So, we think as I say that the California decision is controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="4732.328" offset="19032691">I should in that connection mention once more point, there are coastguard lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="4741.347" offset="19068740">There are some of the bays in California was not along the whole coast as there is here in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="4749.853" offset="19102804">Neither party in the California case thought had appropriate to invoke those lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="4759.627" offset="19141883">They might've been invoked on both parties thought that they were irrelevant and we so stated to the Court as I remember it during oral argument mentioning the existence of the lines.</text>

            <text syncTime="6241.204" offset="25068231">It seems to me that the reasons behind it are very sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="6245.725" offset="25086307">I just want to give one more answer to Justice White and then I will come directly to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="6252.197" offset="25112116">Alright, there are decisions, Justice White, particularly the English case of Indianapolis which suggest that a nation has the power to set a rules in navigation requirements of navigation for vessels approaching or leaving their ports and if that, I don't want to overstate that line, if that is sound law and the coastguard relies on it, as I understand it, then that would validate these rules simply as the requirements of navigation because for all practical purposes the only vessels coming in here are going to foreign vessels coming in here are going to be foreign vessels going to the ports of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="6302.412" offset="25313050">Now, I come to the question raised by Justice Fortas, what about Section 2 (c) of the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6315.247" offset="25364355">We say that it cannot have meant the inland water line as laid down by the coastguard or the Secretary of the Treasury for number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="6329.969" offset="25423287">First, the evidence is very persuasive that the term was used in the international sentence in reference to a general body of international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6342.293" offset="25472502">This was the flavor of the debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6344.888" offset="25482951">There are specific references to the courts used of the term in the early California case where it clearly indicated that it referred to use it in the international sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6355.370" offset="25524851">And there is specific legislative history which Justice Harlan asked me about earlier with respect to the coastguard line.</text>
            <text syncTime="6366.301" offset="25568528">There was testimony from Leander Perez of the delta area and an Assistant Attorney General of Louisiana which referred to the coastguard line.</text>
            <text syncTime="6381.707" offset="25630177">Remembering that time, this line did not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="6386.976" offset="25651284">Indeed, under the regulations that out East Bay wasn't even behind the coastguard line.</text>
            <text syncTime="6392.807" offset="25674585">And this was referred too in the testimony pretty much I think in passing at, did I say hearings on the Submerged Lands Act, if I did I was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="6402.930" offset="25715127">It was referred to two Congresses earlier at hearings on previous bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="6408.587" offset="25737697">Then, the matter was brought up again during the hearings before the interior committee of the senate on the bills that became the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6418.621" offset="25777821">And Senator Anderson cut-in and said, well, we've been all through that and we found that that line won't help us.</text>
            <text syncTime="6424.731" offset="25802271">Well, that was the end of the discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6427.247" offset="25812407">I added of course that a number of reasons it might not help but what happened was that it affected very little in the coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="6437.038" offset="25851486">And it seems to me that it is most unlikely that Congress intended to give some official then the coastguard power to draw the lines that would be decisive for the purposes of the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6471.948" offset="25991189">Mr. Justice Black, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6475.699" offset="26006131">The core of our position with respect to the coastguard line comes down to these three sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="6488.003" offset="26055346">First, that when Congress spoke of the coastline or inland waters in the Submerged Lands Act it used those terms with reference to international law and the territorial boundaries of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6507.665" offset="26134026">Second, that whatever may be said about the original purposes of the Act of 1895 or the meaning of the original instructions to the Commandant of the coastguard or the Secretary of the Treasury that he has not for years defined a line in terms of international law or the territorial boundaries of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6534.133" offset="26239875">And consequently, the Submerged Lands Act was talking about one thing, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Commandant were talking about another thing, and that other thing is irrelevant for the purposes of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6550.565" offset="26305599">“Inland waters” isn't the word I might add that invariably must have one meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="6557.608" offset="26333811">Louisiana and the statute enacted in 1948 defined the term “inland waters” to cover only waters where the tide have been flowed and excluded all others from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6572.143" offset="26391907">We don't argue that's the meaning of inland waters for the purposes of Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6576.543" offset="26409566">I simply show that this means that this term like others must be construed with reference to its context and what was intended to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="6587.222" offset="26452302">I move on therefore to the second part of the case to the areas behind the blue line which is Louisiana's outermost alternate plan and offshore of the red or pink which we concede to Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="6611.148" offset="26548015">Our position is that the status of those waters is to be determined by applying the Geneva Convention in a practical commonsense manner in accordance with its terms and that if something does not qualify as inland waters under the Convention that it is not inland waters for the purposes of the Submerged Lands Act and that this is true of all our coast and therefore specifically true of the coast of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="6645.436" offset="26685106">Now, in that connection I think it's worth looking at the Geneva Convention and calling attention to a few things in support of my proposition that it's intended to be universal and exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="6659.792" offset="26742575">And since we omitted to print the full text that may be fairer to use, the text is printed by Louisiana which is in the appendix, the third volume of their briefs beginning at page 127.</text>
            <text syncTime="6676.386" offset="26808926">I would call the Court's attention first to Article 3 on page 128.</text>
            <text syncTime="6685.373" offset="26844871">Limits of the territorial sea, except as otherwise provided in these articles, the normal baseline for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea is the low water line along the coast is marked on the large scale official chart.</text>
            <text syncTime="6703.896" offset="26918954">So that unless one can bring himself within an exception elsewhere provided in these articles is low water -- is the coastline is the line along the coast, the low water line along the coast is marked on the large scale official chart.</text>
            <text syncTime="6723.953" offset="26999202">I -- we're not this explicit that that is the line except is provided elsewhere in the articles.</text>
            <text syncTime="6732.787" offset="27034520">Less any question arise, I should call attention to the word “normal” which it seems to us quite clear in this connection means the line according to rule, the line according to standard and not some word like “generally or ordinarily or usually.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6755.088" offset="27123754">This is very clear from the history at one stage without attempting to quote exactly the predecessor of Article 3 did include words like “generally” and the word “normal” baseline was in the title.</text>
            <text syncTime="6776.446" offset="27209122">Then for the specific and explained purpose of making it clear that there was no discretion except as provided in the Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="6785.977" offset="27247261">Those words “generally or usually” were strict and the explanation was given that the purpose of the Convention was to provide an exclusive uniform set of rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="6810.053" offset="27343600">I think it means according to standard, according to rule and I point out that this through many versions did not have normal in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6819.059" offset="27379649">The word “normal” was put in only by the drafting committee and only when it was decided to give up titles.</text>
            <text syncTime="6828.778" offset="27418520">And for some reason it was put in that and I think it simply means the baseline according to rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="6838.559" offset="27457599">It's in other words the drafting committee would've been authorized to make such a major exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="6845.360" offset="27484766">Alright, now there are other articles that make it quite plain that the Convention was defining the territorial sea and contiguous zone in the coastline both inclusively and exclusively.</text>

            <text syncTime="6892.139" offset="27671907">Indeed, another incident that tends to show this Justice Stewart at one time there was an effort in the proprietary drafts to state what was international law and then new proposal separately, and it was decided that this should not be done because there wasn't enough agreement on what was international law, and that the only way to get rules eliminating everyone's discretion was to set them down in a treaty that everyone would adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="6922.810" offset="27794578">Another indication was pointed out this morning, this agreement, this treaty does not define the breadth of the territorial sea it leaves that to each nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6938.753" offset="27858422">And the draftsmen were very careful to avoid saying its three miles leaving anybody to claim more if he wanted to so as to leave the question what is the breadth of the territorial sea, of course, we have always taken the position that it's no more than three miles.</text>

            <text syncTime="7838.779" offset="31458513">Because the evidence that Louisiana invokes here for the purposes of claiming historic bays rather plainly fails to meet the test of anybody actively asserting jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="7854.029" offset="31519535">Certainly, the advancing of abstract theories of international law that other nations didn't accept that we're not settled international law without ever applying them to particular areas cannot be regarded as the necessary kind of assertion of jurisdiction to constitute in historic bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="7880.448" offset="31625174">Even more clearly, old maps like a commerce department map to which you were referred this morning which were drawn for limited purposes do not constitute an assertion of jurisdiction as against other states in the international sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="7899.516" offset="31701452">Statutes in Louisiana purporting to regulate the taking of shrimp or oysters or natural resources, I and ostensibly applicable in these waters are not sufficient as the Court held in the California case because they do not involved an actual as enforcement of jurisdiction against a foreign nation.</text>

            <text syncTime="7932.325" offset="31832691">Our series of criminal prosecution under some of their natural resources laws, there are three answers to those points.</text>
            <text syncTime="7944.885" offset="31882951">First, so far as we know all of those offenses under Louisiana law may well have been committed within the territorial sea, the three-mile strip within the bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="7958.906" offset="31938957">Some of them, one can tell for the records, where within that three-mile strip.</text>
            <text syncTime="7963.285" offset="31956511">Second, all of the defendants so far as the instances they gave us were concerned were residence of Louisiana and therefore presumably citizens of Louisiana and under this Court's decision in (Inaudible) and Florida, Louisiana has the power to regulate their conduct on the high seas just as much as anywhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="7989.933" offset="32063091">And the third point I mentioned earlier and that is that what one of our 50 states does in our view is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="7998.959" offset="32099244">Now, against the background of those generalizations, I'd like to take what time I can on some of the specific areas that are in controversy.</text>

            <text syncTime="8174.686" offset="32802147">There's no bay about that and Article 7 paragraph 6 is limited to bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="8183.140" offset="32835897">Alright, I was about to start at the west end of the coastline and take the segment which runs from Sabine Pass here to take their point which is on the coast about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="8203.809" offset="32918653">You'll know that both that our line and Louisiana's line when it applies the Convention follows the coast except for these fingers reaching out, curiously they even reach out into the area that's already been adjudicated to be ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="8224.696" offset="33002141">Those are the inland -- dredged channels to which Mr. Miller referred this morning and which Louisiana claims our part of her coast under the Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="8241.438" offset="33069119">These channels appeared down here at Sabine lake in Calcasieu Pass and that fresh water Bayou, but there are other points along the coast where such channels exist and consequently this is a recurrent problem and it seemed well to deal with it at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="8265.236" offset="33164309">Now, first I must point out that Louisiana's statement on page 336 of the brief that the congressional history of the Submerged Lands Act clearly shows that both the Senate and House of Representatives considered dredged ship channels to be part of the inland waters of the United States is not accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="8295.160" offset="33284054">The facts are these, the history does show that at one stage the Senate Committee on interior and insular affairs considered and there was in the Bill a definition of inland waters which include all estuaries, ports, harbors, bays, channels, straights, historic bays, and sounds whether this included dredged channels or not is anyone's guess.</text>
            <text syncTime="8327.216" offset="33412263">My guess would be that it use channels in the sense of the English Channel or some other body of water between an island and the mainland rather than something just leading out of perhaps 20 miles into the ocean but I can't say that I'm right but it certainly doesn't give I'm as right as they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="8350.830" offset="33506722">The next thing that is clear is that this language was deliberately struck out of the Bill in an effort to leave the definition of inland waters entirely to Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8363.333" offset="33556668">So that no one can infer that there was any intention to include these errors and we come to consider the question therefore like all other questions in terms of the Geneva Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="8379.077" offset="33619675">The question turns on Article 3 and 8 of the Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="8385.499" offset="33645380">Article 3, we noted before except for where other was provided in these articles the normal baseline for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea is the low water line along the coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="8401.586" offset="33709746">Now, I ask you keeping that in mind the low water line along the coast to jump to Article 8 which begins at the very bottom of page 106 in the Louisiana appendix for the purpose of delimiting the territorial sea, the outermost permanent harbour works which form an integral part of the harbour system shall be regarded as forming part of the coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="8432.212" offset="33832208">So that the question we have asked ourselves is whether a dredged channel leading out from a port is a part of the permanent harbour works within the meaning of Article 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="8449.780" offset="33902529">We submit that such a channel even though marked by aids to navigation of buoys and some places, day beacons, lighthouses and alike is not part of the permanent harbour works that the term harbour works refers only to raise installations like piers and jetties and breakwaters which also a man-made are physical part of the coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="8484.271" offset="34040456">I rest that conclusion on several things.</text>
            <text syncTime="8487.869" offset="34054875">The first place I don't think just a matter of the ordinary use of words what would normally think of a dredged channel or a channel that's not been dredged that leads out from a part was covered by a river as part of the harbour works it seems to me an extraordinary use.</text>

            <text syncTime="9038.734" offset="36258356">Second, there a very considerable number of other issues which can't be elucidated by any further factual evidence and I think those should be decided by the Court now.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="9091.860" offset="36470784">Well I -- the reason I was going to say as against the advantages of sending it to a Master from the Court's point of view in terms of the total administration of justice if this case went to a Master with nothing decided with the coastguard line, no one would know what evidence to put in and what evidence not to put in, and the result of course would be everybody would dump in all the evidence that he could find and I think the total effect would be a worst morass and that the Court would have it all back in.</text>
            <text syncTime="9128.075" offset="36615711">Now, the last part of my answer, Mr. Justice Harlan, is that there are some points that the argument where there appeared to be some questions of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="9143.494" offset="36677360">I don't think those are real questions put on the face of the briefs they seem to be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="9149.292" offset="36700557">I do think that if the Court were to do the work of resolving the questions of law now that it would turn out that there were no significant factual differences among it.</text>
            <text syncTime="9161.560" offset="36749563">So, on the whole, by urging, my recommendation is that the Court must face a large number I think all of these questions but I don't want to pretend that isn't the difficult matter of balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="9178.426" offset="36817063">What I do want to urge very strongly is that authorities be given -- will be given all the guidance and that the Master be given if the Court decides to send it to Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="9190.207" offset="36864188">All the guidance it can that is I think the question I've been talking about is one that can be resolve here.</text>
            <text syncTime="9196.077" offset="36887698">I don't think this and many of the other questions can be resolve here if there remain some others then at least we can get part of the money distributed but we could focus on specific issues in the subsequent proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="9210.853" offset="36946735">And I think it would be more efficient way to administer justice.</text>
