            <text syncTime="13.227" offset="156296">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.004" offset="175417">I'd like to return for a moment to the question Mr. Justice Douglas asked yesterday and the suggestion that there must have been a control by Western over Regal because of Western's 55% stock interest in Regal and my response to Mr. Justice Douglas' question was that although Western was in a position to control Regal, there was no evidence that there was in fact control.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.737" offset="342288">I'd like to add and answer to this morning and say that I think it will be recognized that Western as a majority stockholder in Regal had an obligation to the minority stockholders in Regal and it was Western's obligation as a majority stockholder to honor its obligations to the minority and to see that Regal could resell its gasoline at a price that would return to Regal a normal profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.576" offset="493693">In other words, that the majority in Western had an obligation to refrain from dealing with Regal and controlling Regal to the point that Regal would operate at a loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.034" offset="563493">Now, the fact is that Western paid Signal slightly higher or approximately the same prices towards gasoline that Perkins paid Standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.951" offset="627127">Now, Signal owned a majority interest in Western and was obligated to treat the minority interest in Western fairly and to refrain from compelling Western to operate at a loss, or to sell at a loss to Regal.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.730" offset="718242">Beyond this, the fact of the matter was that the minority stockholders in Western were actually the controlling officers and control the operations of Western and they were in a very good position to see that their own interests were properly taken care of.</text>

            <text syncTime="808.140" offset="3335920">Just because somewhere down the line, a purchaser of Signal gasoline may be third, fourth, fifth level down below, a purchaser of Signal gasoline somewhere confronted and competed with a purchaser of Perkins gasoline, that wouldn't make Perkins and Signal a competitors or competitors for the purpose of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.321" offset="3440619">And then that couldn't -- that wouldn't mean that Perkins and Signal competed on the secondary level because if this was so then every non-primary line case would have to be a secondary line case.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.633" offset="3497880">And clearly, this is what -- it's not what Congress meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.683" offset="3510105">Congress recognized the realities of the market.</text>

            <text syncTime="856.420" offset="3529017">When Congress talked about competition with the grantor, competition with the favorite purchaser, competition with the customer of the favorite purchaser and if the argument is accepted just because somewhere way down the line, there are people who compete for the gasoline derived from these two sources, Signal and Perkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.581" offset="3625671">Now, that means that Perkins and Signal were competing at the secondary line then this elaborate definitional language used by Congress would be entirely superfluous.</text>

            <text syncTime="993.264" offset="4076440">There were many material errors the trial could have presented to the Court of Appeals which the Court of Appeals did not rule upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.975" offset="4115310">One of them was this question of causality and that question of causality cuts across the Robinson-Patman Act standards as well as the original Clayton Act standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.124" offset="4163897">Now, in addition there were serious and important questions concerning liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.470" offset="4189288">There were questions concerning the fact of injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.260" offset="4200364">There were also questions concerning the good faith meeting of competition defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.126" offset="4223875">Some of these questions that Court of Appeals ruled on against Perkins, others it reserved the ruling but admonished that its failure to rule was not to be taken by the trial court as appellate approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.760" offset="4286464">Now, to resolve these questions would require a review of this vast record of some 6000 pages of transcript and some 15,000 or more pages of exhibits which we suggest would more appropriately be left in the first instance to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.601" offset="4409762">I have one more point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.632" offset="4421883">There has been some talked about Regal selling at a loss, Mr. Justice Fortas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.911" offset="4442990">Regal must not have sold at a loss because there was a difference between five and six cents according to Perkins' testimony between the price that Regal sold and the price that Perkins' single retail station in Vancouver sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.088" offset="4547688">Now, this difference certainly could have been attributed to the less than one-half cent price differential that was granted in Signal after January.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.888" offset="4610905">And again, I don't think we can assume that Regal would sell at a loss because I don't think that there would have -- I think that the majority stockholders there in Western would have been violating their obligations to the minority to have compelled Regal to sell.</text>
