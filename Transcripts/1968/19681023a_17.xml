            <text syncTime="15.600" offset="165804">I believe the impression was left yesterday that a taxpayer in this case accumulated a substantial amount of funds and the sole purpose was the avoidance of tax but that was not the decision of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.627" offset="221915">The first inquiry is whether the accumulation exceeds the reasonable needs of taxpayer's business.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.494" offset="257337">But this phrase has come to me in the fixed, definite, and certain needs of the business or written obligation of the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.833" offset="298715">It's a test which the Government has tried to restrict as closely as possible.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="53.940" offset="319091">But we know, do we have that before us or don't, isn't the matter issue before us the Government's request for an instruction the denial of that instruction then the action of the Court of Appeals in reversing for further procedures pursuant to the standard that it laid down?</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard L. Braunstein</label>

            <label>Mr. Richard L. Braunstein</label>
            <text syncTime="84.122" offset="439881">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.826" offset="442702">This issue is not before the Court but I think it's pertinent in terms of the effect of what the Government proposes to ask this Court to set the test because in circumstances like this, the jury found that the taxpayer did not have fixed and definite purposes but they held that he did not have a tax avoidance purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.302" offset="540609">The taxpayer stated that he had plans for expansion, he intended to buy stock in a distributor and the theory we can infer believe that this was the purpose motivating his conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.575" offset="597661">So, while it was not fixed, definite, and certain, nevertheless, it was a permissible purpose and the facts were that the taxpayer did purchase $380,000.00 worth of the distributor's stock that the taxpayer did expand and it was because of this expansion and purchase that the taxpayers continue to be successful but the critical point is that it's the Government's position that in adopting the A purpose test, you would then ask the taxpayer only two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.753" offset="730363">Number one, if the distribution was made to you would it be taxable?</text>
            <text syncTime="161.449" offset="749171">Number two, were you aware that if a distribution was made to you it would be taxable?</text>
            <text syncTime="167.843" offset="774771">And if both of those answers were yes, then it's my understanding that regardless of the fact that taxpayer's purpose is dominant purpose the whole purpose of the accumulation was for expansion to preserve and expand the business that nevertheless the penalty would apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="211.581" offset="949687">I don't regard that that is what the Government is asking this Court to rule on.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.872" offset="970898">I think they say very clearly that if the avoidance of tax is one of 100 purposes regardless of its significance then the tax applies and how do you determine what do you mean by avoidance of tax?</text>
            <text syncTime="234.426" offset="1041115">Well, avoidance of tax is knowledge that a distribution results in taxable income and the whole thrust of the Government's argument and our argument here is such a test really rights out the purpose test because this --</text>

            <text syncTime="249.809" offset="1102660">I guess it gets pretty abstruse but and maybe those difference between and what we're struggling with is a shading between the words “purpose, effect and motive.”</text>

            <text syncTime="266.056" offset="1167548">I think that is correct and it's basically our position that the Sixth Circuit correctly characterized the test in terms of the dominant and impelling motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.551" offset="1229615">It's -- I think one of the difficult things is the burden of proof that the taxpayer has and if you enunciate a test other than the dominant or impelling test whether it has any meaning because once the Court finds that an accumulation is beyond the objectively reasonable needs of the business we're face or the taxpayer is face with a determinative presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.542" offset="1345494">He has to go forward and prove in very heavy burden that this was not the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.802" offset="1378617">He obviously cannot say, “Well, that was not my purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.460" offset="1393246">I don't think that carries the burden.”</text>
            <text syncTime="324.876" offset="1402859">I think he's compelled to give specific and definite reasons as it relates to his motivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.800" offset="1434624">Now, as a practical matter, these cases are tried four or five years after the year in issue and he cannot fabricate.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.448" offset="1473181">I -- I think there is -- the Government is concerned about that these are subjective matters that there is no objective way to determine or test the testimony of the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.758" offset="1522395">But this is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.805" offset="1530546">He's talking about a situation of his intentions of his plans and we're viewing these four or five years after and he -- when he says must be susceptible to objective verification or reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.505" offset="1589373">And it's out position that it's only through utilization of the dominant or impelling test that there is any meaning in the phrase avoidance of the purpose that any other test just puts an impossible burden on the taxpayer and I think this is why we believe the Government's position and I think it's very clear when I say, “One out of 100.”</text>
            <text syncTime="397.601" offset="1693759">That's enough to carry today.</text>

            <text syncTime="664.922" offset="2763107">And 533 (a) really makes the test of that intent to avoid stockholder tax a very minor consequence as I read it, it says that once you find that the earnings of the corporation are permitted or accumulate beyond the reasonable needs of the business that that “shall be determinative of the purpose to avoid the income tax with respect to shareholders unless the corporation by the preponderance of the evidence shall prove to the contrary.”</text>
