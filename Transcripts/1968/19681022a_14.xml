            <label>Mr. Emanuel Harris</label>
            <text syncTime="30.546" offset="225573">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.768" offset="242395">The question involved on this certiorari is the effect of the failure of a third arbitrator in a tripartite arbitration proceeding in departing to disclose prior business relations between them whether that -- whether an award made in such a proceeding is invalid under the Federal Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.509" offset="365380">The Act provides that the award may be vacated where the award was procured by corruption or fraud, where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators or either of them or where the arbitrator is guilty of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.402" offset="468929">These -- this case arises out of contracts between the petitioner and the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.105" offset="495783">The petitioner was a subcontractor of the respondent Samford for the performance of work, painting work on five construction projects in Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.959" offset="547192">The respondent Samford was the general contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.315" offset="564642">The claims of petitioner was that the Samford, although it received payment from the owner for the work performed by the petitioner failed to make progress payments to the petitioner and therefore the petitioner abandoned the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.732" offset="638307">The claim of Samford is that the petitioner abandoned and stopped work on the contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.371" offset="668818">The contracts provided for arbitration of all disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.573" offset="689716">The respondents binding companies were the sureties on Samford's Miller Act bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.618" offset="721795">The contract, as I said, provided for the arbitration of disputes and the respondent bonding companies obtained a stay of the suit against them under Miller Act bonds pending the determination of the arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.103" offset="783757">Pursuant to the procedure established by the contracts, the petitioner and Samford each appointed one arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.633" offset="817925">Those two arbitrators appointed an arbitrator by the name of Capacete.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.843" offset="842794">At the time the arbitrators were designated and prior to the arbitration proceedings, petitioner's attorney, Mr. Romero made an investigation to discover whether any of the arbitrators had prior business relations with any of the parties and he found none and none of the arbitrators informed him of any such prior relations and he states in an affidavit in the record that if he had known about such prior previous relations, he would asked a lawyer, have objected to the arbitrator's capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.357" offset="984795">The respondents state in their briefs throughout their brief that no inquiry was made by the petitioner, totally disregarding this affidavit by Mr. Romero although they devote about five pages in their brief in attempt to discredit Mr. Romero's affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.344" offset="1060760">Furthermore, in their --</text>

            <text syncTime="264.268" offset="1160443">However, it was admitted in the respondent's brief that Capacete did discuss possible arbitrators with Mr. Romero at the time a vacancy appeared in the Board of Arbitrators and as a matter of fact, at the time, on the request of Mr. Romero, Mr. Capacete furnished a list of lawyers who knew something about engineering cases and from that list furnished by Mr. Capacete, a third arbitrator was designated to fill the vacancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.529" offset="1289488">Now, Capacete at that time did not say anything about his prior relations with Samford.</text>

            <text syncTime="623.301" offset="2596551">Now, here's the justification made by the respondents in this case, first they say that the services -- I mean it's undisputed that Capacete rendered services to the respondents for which his company was paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.519" offset="2649422">He admitted that.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.843" offset="2654751">He admitted that he never told the petitioner or the other arbitrators about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.848" offset="2674813">He admitted that he had -- in fact he testified that he had no reason to disclose.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.792" offset="2698533">Now, in the face of that, and referring to the nature of these relations, the respondent went so far as to impose a condition on the petitioner at the time the petitioner was going to fill a vacancy in the board that they could appoint a successor arbitrator without objection, without the consent of Samford subject to the right of Samford to object, if the person selected, had any interest or involvements in the matters arbitrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.569" offset="2857671">In other words, the very situation -- and Mr. Romero referred to that situation in the District Court as evidence of a guilty conscience that Samford was making sure that the very situation was not present on our side and then the counsel for the respondent says that was a very reasonable and understandable thing to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.216" offset="2952234">In other words, it was reasonable and understandable for the respondent to fail to disclose prior relations but it was not reasonable and understandable for us, the petitioner, to object when we found out what the circumstances in the evidence was that was not reasonable and understandable for us.</text>

            <text syncTime="736.506" offset="3049409">They terminated about a year before the arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.161" offset="3060067">They lasted for five years from about 1959, 1958 to 1961, about five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.425" offset="3093086">Now, one of the points that the respondents makes with reference to these relations, they say that the services rendered -- by the way, these services aren't the very project, some of them involved in the arbitration and they say that these services were not rendered by Capacete but rendered by his company.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.517" offset="3173439">But Capacete himself testified that he personally using the pronoun “I” rendered these services and that he owned this company which they say carried on to these prior transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.015" offset="3223385">On examination by respondents counsel, he admitted that he owned 67% of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.266" offset="3252433">Now, whether or not that his company performed the services or he performed them for the benefit of his company of course that's no justification for fairly to disclose these relations if the services were performed by him by the benefit of his company.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.764" offset="3326412">Certainly, the duty to disclose him arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.629" offset="3341876">He can't hide behind the public and say I did this for my company so I don't have to tell the petitioner that I have these prior relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.251" offset="3376358">Also they say that only $12,000.00 was paid to the arbitrator in his companies for all the services rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.934" offset="3415124">At what amount does the duty of ours to make disclosure, to do as far as contend that this Court should fix an amount in dollars and cents about $12,000.00 or percentage of income when that duty arises and they also said that the services rendered by the arbitrator were different than the services rendered by the petitioner, the arbitrator having performed services in connection with drilling and investigation of foundations whereas the petitioner's services were for painting on the very same projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.305" offset="3548557">I mean, could you have a more ridiculous justification or excuse for failing to disclose the relation?</text>
            <text syncTime="867.228" offset="3572276">Does -- do the services rendered by the arbitrator have to be exactly the same in kind and character as the other party before he's required to disclose these qualifying relations?</text>
            <text syncTime="893.425" offset="3677080">The respondents in their brief attempt to avoid the facts of concealment with euphemistic phrases that they don't have to volunteer.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.232" offset="3724309">There's no duty to volunteer information not solicited.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.827" offset="3742699">But the Court of Appeals at sum said that there was a difficult line between what has to be volunteered and what may await for inquiry but the Court of Appeals held in this case that the information should have been disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.006" offset="3807378">The line that the respondents argue here is that we didn't conceal, we just didn't volunteer.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.713" offset="3838203">I submit to this Court that that certainly is no explanation, excuse or justification to the use of semantics to justify the violation of the obligation to disclose.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.993" offset="3899329">Now, principally, with reference to Capacete, he was the third arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.727" offset="3922317">He is supposed to be neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.928" offset="3935065">The courts have made it clear that arbitrators designated by the parties are expected to have relations with the parties, even expected perhaps to favor the parties that designated them.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.332" offset="3988668">But the neutral arbitrator is under a strictest standard of impartiality, freedom from bias and prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.941" offset="4023150">Certainly, this state, it requires that when a neutral arbitrator, a third arbitrator is chosen that the least that can be expected of him is that he should disclose facts which show that he's not in truth and in fact neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.283" offset="4088456">And the importance of this appears in the record because one of the arbitrators who was appointed at the time a vacancy occurred testified that he relied on Capacete.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.075" offset="4131715">He did not examine each and every document himself but relied on Capacete for decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.185" offset="4160136">Who can tell from this record whether the prior relations did not affect his decisions?</text>

            <text syncTime="1021.867" offset="4190856">Those are not unanimous award and this arbitrator who testified that he depended on Capacete was one of the lawyers whose names on -- who was on the list given by Capacete to Mr. Romero as an attorney who knew something about engineering services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.901" offset="4255013">Indirectly, Capacete recommended this arbitrator who said that he depended on Capacete for his decisions and that emphasizes the importance of a third arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.979" offset="4303287">Now, the respondents contend in their brief that an arbitrator is like a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.099" offset="4323767">An arbitrator is stronger and a more important position than a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.925" offset="4351039">You can appeal from a judge's decision but there's no appeal from an arbitrator on law or fact and that's the reason why the position of the third arbitrator in this case is so important because there's no appeal from the award on questions of law and fact and that's why the strict standard is required, a stricter standard is required of the third arbitrator rather than the other arbitrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.277" offset="4492518">The respondents in their brief referred to the magnitude and intensity of hidden and active dispute between the parties including many contested and contradicted contentions and complex disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.060" offset="4567646">Obviously, if you have a failure to disclose and assuming that Capacete willfully failed to disclose, then certainly, the respondent willfully failed to disclose, naturally, you cannot find in the record positive evidence to show partiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.220" offset="4640266">The very fact of concealment which is undisputed in the record shows the partiality which makes this award vulnerable under the Federal Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.034" offset="4699512">Now, if Your Honors please, these respondents say that a setting aside of this award would frustrate the purpose of arbitration, which would be to give final and quick relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.144" offset="4759907">The purpose of an arbitration is to have an honest proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.906" offset="4783000">If there's any frustration of that purpose, the respondents themselves are responsible for the vulnerability and for this tainted award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.019" offset="4827408">They have been responsible for the thousand hours of work that they refer to in their brief and they have subjected the petitioner to the tremendous burden and expense of carrying through an arbitration wholly unaware of the secrecy and the affiliation and the tie-in between this arbitrator and the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.752" offset="4934405">And notwithstanding this failure to work, to disclose these relations and these attempted justification for this failure which absolutely doesn't stand up morally or legally and they object and they say that this -- that setting aside this award would frustrate the purpose of arbitration when they are responsible for the facts which result in this frustration, they actually complain in their brief that we didn't pay our share of Capacete's $3,000.00 fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.627" offset="5077870">Your Honors, I submit that I never -- it's adding insult to injury, that's the only way to describe it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.953" offset="5111202">I submit that this award is not only immoral, legally untenable and for this Court to sustain contentions that in circumstances like this there is no duty to disclose the prior relations would open the door to corruption, so that you couldn't have an honest arbitration where you had a situation something like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.158" offset="5207960">I submit that under the facts in this case, you have a dishonest determination which this Court should not permit to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.448" offset="5253204">Let me give you an instance of how the record even though it doesn't positively disclose the partiality, how the record discloses that there must have been partiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.610" offset="5301791">The total amount of these contracts was $350,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.201" offset="5320182">They were paid about $200,000.00 leaving an unpaid balance of $140,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.271" offset="5344423">The petitioner claimed $113,000.00 for work that it did perform, leaving about $28,000.00 of uncompleted work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.003" offset="5379427">The arbitrators allowed Samford $158,000.00 to finish $28,000.00 of work.</text>

            <text syncTime="1451.328" offset="5908668">May I respond to that and attempt to address this Court and establish that not only were the arbitrators more than justified in their award but that the procedures followed were also legal and ethical and proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.618" offset="5993827">The subcontractor, the large painting subcontractor owned by three, the record reveals there are three owners, two from New York, one in Puerto Rico.</text>

            <text syncTime="1509.113" offset="6139800">It's only part of the evidence that establishes the back charges, every hour of additional work required when the prime contractor had to perform work that the subcontractor did not perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.772" offset="6210435">Painting behind the bushes, buildings had been painted the wrong color.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.471" offset="6237288">The subcontract required the subcontractor to pay the payments monthly and on time for paint and supplies so there would be liens against the property or claims against this Miller Act bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.616" offset="6293817">Instead of that, false statements were turned in by the subcontractor saying payments have been made to the suppliers and the contractor discovered there was $40,000.00 to $60,000.00 of such paints.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.901" offset="6350973">The arbitrators in short Your Honor, there is more than abundant evidence are in this Court to establish a breach on the part of the subcontractor which provoked the demand by the prime contractor when the sub abandoned the work, even though the contract provided in the event of the dispute, the work would continue and they would immediately have arbitration, each contractor would appoint an arbitrator and those two would appoint a third and the vote of any two would be a controlling vote that would be the majority, that would be binding and enforced within the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.228" offset="6528293">They abandoned the work, contrary to that contractual commitment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1705.542" offset="6925563">We thought that this matter had been abandoned by judicial stipulation that the parties had abandoned any contention that they had a ground to complain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.421" offset="6969031">The basis for that is that we find in the record and in our brief on page 38 and 39, we have at least some four or five quotations from petitioner's counsel stating for example.</text>

            <text syncTime="3672.421" offset="14793017">In answer to Mr. Justice Fortas about whether the District Court ever made any ruling with respect to the duty to disclose because of the closeness of relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.544" offset="14845576">The opinion of the District Court is printed in the appendix on pages 184 and 185.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.682" offset="14870131">The District Court said nothing about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.231" offset="14880266">It did not disclose, it did not discuss at all the closeness of the relationships and the statement of Mr. Currie that we abandoned that issue is ridiculous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.417" offset="14937004">Our whole case in the District Court, out side of these other objections was the failure to disclose and the Court of Appeals in this opinion said that that was the sole issue on appeal and was based on that point that we ask this Court to grant certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.992" offset="15011297">How can Mr. Currie say that we abandoned that issue?</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.786" offset="15026552">Now, with reference to Mr. Romero bringing a good friend or Mr. Capacete, Mr. Capacete testified that he was a good friend of Mr. Romero.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.953" offset="15063228">He know Mr. Romero's father.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.255" offset="15072423">They belong to the Rotary Club and yet Mr. Capacete acting as a most important judge in this proceeding wouldn't even tell his good friend about his relations with Samford.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.637" offset="15125922">I ask Your Honors if that relationship should not have been disclosed between good friends, would a judge try a case before with a good friend as an attorney for one of the parties without disclosing a prior relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.274" offset="15192482">I submit that that's the situation of this case and the award should be set aside.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="3776.875" offset="15210872">Are you suggesting, you should have disqualified himself because he was a good friend of your counsel?</text>

            <label>Mr. Emanuel Harris</label>
            <text syncTime="3781.898" offset="15230934">Oh, No.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.575" offset="15233651">Not because he was a good friend but because he didn't tell his good friend what his relation was with Samford and furthermore, the mere fact that the two arbitrators designated by the parties shows Capacete, does that relieve Capacete from disclosing his relationship because the other two arbitrators picked him?</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.915" offset="15335006">But the very fact that the other two arbitrators picked him and that he was employed by Samford should have emphasized his duty to disclose to the petitioner and the petitioner's attorney his relations with the very people who by coincidence, I will assume, he became an arbitrator for in this proceeding because he was chosen by the other two.</text>
