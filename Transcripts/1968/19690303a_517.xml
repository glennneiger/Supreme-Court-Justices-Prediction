            <text syncTime="63.082" offset="355662">It arises out of the United States army's seizure and use of private property, in this case buildings belonging to the petitioners during the Panamanian riots of 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.433" offset="429119">The issue before this Court as we view it is whether the Court of Claims correctly held the that U.S. military forces may sieze and use private property without incurring a duty to provide compensation under the Fifth Amendment whenever they are faced with a “immediate necessity.”</text>

            <text syncTime="114.757" offset="562448">This is a chart that was prepared by the United States Government for presentation to the organization of American states following the Panamanian riots in the course of a charge that United States was the aggressor in these riots.</text>

            <text syncTime="145.530" offset="685537">This is Cristobal and Cologne in the Atlantic or northern end of the zone.</text>

            <text syncTime="161.735" offset="750320">On the evening in question, January 9, 1964, United States Military Forces were called to this end of the zone in response to request from the civilian command and ordered to clear the zone of rioters.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.761" offset="806431">United States Army troops starting here on Front Street moved down 11th street, cleared the zone of rioters, move behind the YMCA and the Masonic Temple, had brief scuffles with rioters who were then in both of those buildings, evicted them, moved them out to the streets -- thank you, move them out in the streets and took a position, stationed troops on the bound -- in the middle of the street just inside the border on the boundary line.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.890" offset="906951">This is approximately from 10 to midnight on the night of January 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.307" offset="928580">Shortly after midnight, they began to receive sniper fire directed at the troop stationed in front of the buildings.</text>

            <text syncTime="247.939" offset="1095137">Troops are stationed along Bolivar Avenue in 11th Street, they began to receive sniper fire and at that point the local commander ordered them to withdraw into the YMCA, Masonic Temple and the Old Commissary.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.236" offset="1148322">Throughout the night, snipers continued to harass the army troops inside the building.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.593" offset="1169742">In the morning of the 10th, the mob began to form over here on Bolivar Avenue and directed a concentrated Molotov cocktail attack first at the YMCA where our company, a 140 men of troops were housed.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.836" offset="1230764">They finally -- about two o'clock in the afternoon of the 10th, succeeded in setting it on fire forcing the troops to evacuate at which point they moved down the street and began to concentrate on the Masonic Temple in which the army not only had troops but it established a command post and an observation post.</text>

            <text syncTime="318.124" offset="1375901">The mob was unable to set the Masonic Temple on fire due to a difference in construction although they did start some fires in the interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.984" offset="1403277">They there upon moved down to the old commissary not owned by the petitioners, owned by the Government and finally succeeded in setting that on fire with Molotov cocktails in the next day.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.559" offset="1445595">On the basis of these facts, petitioners made claim first in the part of the army and then with the Court of Claims contending that there was liability where the army had siezed and used petitioner's buildings as sources of refuge in defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="499.366" offset="2100851">Judge Davis dissented, Judge Davis said that on his basis of the applicable case law, he thought it clear that the Government is liable where at first takes the property for it s own military use and then exposes the place to enemy attack or revokes it leading to injury or destruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.690" offset="2182144">In this connection, Judge Davis said and we should emphasize this, there is no exception from liability as I read the materials for temporary seizures for military use in the face of imminent hostility or to meet an emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.557" offset="2241599">Once the property is taken for a military use, the Government is responsible for a subsequent injury no matter how quickly that follows upon seizure.</text>

            <text syncTime="1712.602" offset="6953775">That's what I'm saying and I'm saying it because it seems to me you have your finger on the distinction which is crucial to the so-called target doctrine in which petitioners may rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.175" offset="7000064">Under that doctrine as petitioners have already argued, if the Government makes a target of a particular building by turning it into a fortification, then in principles of international law at least although it has not been held in the domestic context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.610" offset="7061817">The Government is liable for the damages done, but it is quite clear that in this case, no such target was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.236" offset="7092328">For as Professor Bouchard points out in the work the petitioners cite, the state is responsible for the use and occupation of buildings and real property only if they're being used in more than a temporary way and the use is not impelled by military necessity, thus he says and I quote “the target doctrine extends only to property occupied in advance of actual fighting rather than such as is occupied during an attack or retreat.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.754" offset="7202356">So that even conceding as I have the answer to your question, the established principles applicable in this case require that no compensation be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.855" offset="7246764">There is nothing in the record to suggest that there was any previous use of these buildings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.955" offset="7271215">There were riots in the Canal Zone in 1959 booked into them and so far as I can determine, there was no use made of these buildings at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.553" offset="7305592">It seems to me that the principal task I have to carry out here is to make a case for what we have called the public emergency exception for what President Grant referred to as the exception for temporary use during and under the compulsion of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.835" offset="7378735">And to do that, I have to start at some distance from ordinary Fifth Amendment concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.933" offset="7399111">In particular, I want to look at the body of law which would ordinarily govern the riot situation, that is to say municipal liability for tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.821" offset="7430666">If a person's property were destroyed because the police failed to protect it at all or withdrew from the area when the rioters seemed to be getting the upper hand, he might file a claim on the theory that the police hadn't given him adequate protection or he might make the same claim if he thought that because police use teargas or Billy clubs instead or riffles or machineguns on looters, looting went unchecked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.847" offset="7522722">And indeed, there are many such claims which have been filed in New York and in other cities which were the subject of urban riots.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.431" offset="7549053">Those claims are tort claims and it's apparent that in the absences of statutory liability for riot damage generally, those claims could not succeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.548" offset="7585520">The decisions made whether he used guns or not, where is the most effective place from which to fight a riot, how is the most effective way to deal with it are quite plainly discretionary functions of Government for which no Government concedes tort or other liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.009" offset="7643408">Under federal law for example any such liability would be foreclosed under the Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.855" offset="7666813">And the reasons for denying liability and not -- no lose has occurred, it's rather the desire to avoid any interference with official action but even the prospect of litigation or liability might bring.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.540" offset="7721566">It's to permit the officers to concentrate exclusively on the most efficient way of dealing with the danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.975" offset="7747271">The public necessity exception can be viewed as an extension of this discretionary function reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.168" offset="7772035">By excusing policemen or troops from eminent domain liability from entering buildings in the heat of emergency and for emergency purposes, it too protects their decisions from unwanted influence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.474" offset="7817279">Had the troops in this case simply left the buildings to the mob there would have been no liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.322" offset="7836609">Had they used weapons which kept them off away from the buildings, there would have been no liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.745" offset="7858343">Indeed, it is significant to what the real characterization of this case ought to be, the petitioners make no claim for the value of the use of their premises for what would be the ordinary Fifth Amendment measure of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.175" offset="7912051">They say the troops had a right to be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.840" offset="7922709">They seek only to recover the damage done by the rioting mob when the troops were unable to control them with the weapons their commander allowed them to use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.238" offset="7960325">Thus, petitioners seek exactly the damage that New York merchants will be unable to obtain and should be unable to obtain because of the discretionary function doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.286" offset="8004524">We believe it is as important to foreclose the possibility of liability here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2367.751" offset="9574379">Indeed, other cases of such entry or generally treated as tort matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.712" offset="9590262">If for example, a fireman damages a hedge in bringing a hose to fight a neighbor's fire or a policeman must breakdown the door in order to arrest someone who's hiding behind it, those claims are not ordinarily brought as Fifth Amendment claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.662" offset="9650030">The claims are brought as matters of tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.956" offset="9659225">The fireman was negligent or the policeman had no necessity or legal basis to make his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.511" offset="9681377">And this is no failure of analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.924" offset="9691094">It's entirely consistent with the law and this Court has followed in determining whether or not taking has occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.282" offset="9720456">Under that approach, conduct which is basically tortuous or would be if it occurred between private citizens is insufficient in itself to be a taking in the constitutional sense, thus in the Three Portsmouth Harbor cases in Volumes 231, 250 and 260 of the report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.454" offset="9801226">The Court twice found the firing of harbor guns over petitioners land not to have been takings.</text>

            <text syncTime="2440.635" offset="9865906">Similarly in Cosby and in Griggs versus Allegheny County, this Court stressed the number of times airplanes were flown low over petitioner's houses in discussing the taking issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.354" offset="9908746">In United States versus Dickinson in 331 U.S., the Court said that property is taken in the constitutional sense when inroads are made on an owner's use of it to an extent that as between private parties, a servitude has been acquired either by agreement or in the course of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.664" offset="9978023">There was no agreement in this case and if the servitude did not already exist, the one brief occupancy of petitioner's buildings was insufficient to impress one in itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2744.448" offset="11081122">As I understand the rationale of the doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.529" offset="11105468">Maybe I can -- I should say that I'm perhaps giving too much credence to this international cases involved in the target doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.793" offset="11150503">Maybe I'm following them too far, those cases arose in a special situation where you had neutrals, foreigners living in one country which was at war with insurgents or some other country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.457" offset="11221243">And the troops of the country in which these neutrals lived had to fight a battle with their opponents and chose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.577" offset="11257710">And the choosing is really the important part and chose the place where the neutrals live as the place to fight their battle and the international cases have held that in those circumstances compensation is to be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.450" offset="11313194">Now there is a notion in that that the choice is an invidious one that when the commander of the Government troops is thinking where shall I fight?</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.068" offset="11355617">He may make the decision I'd rather fight where it's not my people's property being damaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.084" offset="11379754">I'd rather fight on the land of the imperialist sugar company or something of that fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.647" offset="11409951">And this rule of compensation was fashioned and applied entirely in cases which might be considered imperialist cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.059" offset="11439626">They involve Latin-American Governments on the one hand, resisting liability and European and American Governments on the other, North American Governments on the other hand insisting upon liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.845" offset="11486751">In such cases, and as we cite in our brief there a number of other cases which refuse to apply the doctrine and refuse to apply it because the (Inaudible) finds there that the property of natives was equally exposed to the risk of harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.087" offset="11543698">There wasn't any discrimination in this case in other words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.448" offset="11557177">So that's a doctrine which arise not only out of the fact of choice but also out of the existence of discrimination and perhaps I should insist that the possibility of discrimination should be there as well as the factor of choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.729" offset="11618304">But the thing which distinguishes the question you put to me Justice Black, from this case is the factor of choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.904" offset="11642964">That at least in that case one could say that the general had visited the area and looked it over and said, “Here we fight.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.186" offset="11672116">Whereas in this case, there is no such factor, the troops went to where the rioters were.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.174" offset="11692074">They had no choice about it.</text>
