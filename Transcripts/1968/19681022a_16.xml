            <label>Mr. James E. Youngdahl</label>
            <text syncTime="62.001" offset="351378">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.426" offset="365066">This was an action by six large railroad companies in a three-judge federal court in Arkansas against officials of the State of Arkansas charged with enforcing two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.332" offset="408743">The first applies to companies with it at least 50 miles of railroad track, when those companies are operating freight train with 25 cars or more, required the crew of an engineer of firemen, a conductor, and three brakemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.578" offset="465690">The second statute applies to railroad companies with at least a 100 miles of track, when operating a switch train over public crossings in urban communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.861" offset="510830">It requires a crew of an engineer, a fireman, a foreman and three helpers.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.639" offset="533922">I represent four Railroad Brotherhoods which were permitted to intervene in the lower courts, speaking for the employees affected by these statutes of full crew laws in question, and our defendant interveners, the defendant appellants in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.073" offset="599646">At this stage of a case, it's the second time this case has been here, at this stage of a case, there are four constitutional issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.214" offset="632247">The court below found that the statutes violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and constitute an impermissible burden of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.604" offset="669759">The railroads also urge in this appeal that there are classification infirmaries in the law in violation of the Equal Protection Clause and indiscrimination against interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.627" offset="721899">The normal statement of the case would not apply in our view to this controversy because it has been 50 or 60 years long, when the opinion of the Court has written in this case, it will be the eleventh entry in the United States' reports on exactly the same Arkansas statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.327" offset="792639">There's been extensive substantive discussion of the same constitutional issues involving the same statutes in five previous opinions of this Court, all of which upheld the legislation challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.583" offset="849690">But evidently, the railroad resources are inexhaustible, and we are back again arguing substantially the same issues in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.424" offset="889083">The first case on the particular statute was in 1911, where the freight crew statute was upheld against three constitutional contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.999" offset="927326">The railroads there argued that with automatic couplers and air brakes, a third brakeman was unnecessary and required an expenditure of a needless amount of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.147" offset="964002">Generally, the Court found and held that those questions even then were concluded by former decisions involving railroads and involving similar constitutional issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.081" offset="1007679">As to the Commerce Clause, we found no violation until Act of Congress displaces the legislation; as to equal protection, several previous decisions involving mileage classifications were noted; and as to due process, the Court found some room for controversy, but found the statute were to remain to the object for this legislature had in view.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.494" offset="1089390">So, even if deemed unwise, where the court would not be overruled by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.984" offset="1111333">The 1916 case in this Court involved the switch crew statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.788" offset="1138500">More summarily, the railroads again, this Court again upheld the statute in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.987" offset="1159293">This time there were again Commerce Clause, equal protection, and due process argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.426" offset="1177057">The only new facts that the railroad brought up with respect to that statute in 1916 was that the switch crew statute does not apply to train of a 25 car length.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.117" offset="1219793">And that the exemption results in the fact that the covered railroad switch over the same crossing as non-covered railroads, therefore, having classification infirmities.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.728" offset="1270262">The Court know that's impossible for legislation to be all comprehensive, that the grouping was reasonable and the statute should be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.345" offset="1300773">The next attempt resulted in the Norwood decision of this Court in 1931.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.927" offset="1319058">This time there were four constitutional arguments: due process, equal protection, Commerce Clause, and the Supremacy Clause, arguing at the Railway Labor Act of Interstate Commerce, Comission regulation that preempted the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.169" offset="1368064">The railroad made some new factual contentions, saying if there was improvement in road and equipment, that some collective bargaining agreements permitted a smaller crew, and that other states had smaller crews and operator law rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.784" offset="1422503">This Court found there was no preemption by the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.448" offset="1437132">The other constitutional issues were in substance resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.600" offset="1453746">And as a matter of fact, if bad faith of a litigation, dismissed the complaint with an extensive discussion about cost of compliance, pointing out if the railroad have completely failed to show that relative cost of compliance had increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.386" offset="1508916">That case was in trial on the merits before a three-judge court in the West District of Arkansas in 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.277" offset="1532531">The Court after a long trial and extensive consideration issued a long and comprehensive decision going down fact by fact of Arkansas railroading but the three-judge court at that point thought that the issues were limited by this Court to a due process challenge of change of conditions and increased relative cost of compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.015" offset="1635453">Both of those arguments so restricted were rejected by the West District of Arkansas which upheld the statues, this Court affirmed in a memorandum opinion of the same year.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.243" offset="1676309">The next discussion by this Court of the same statute in question was in the Landmark Southern Pacific against Arizona case in 1945, where while a train length statute of Arizona was invalidated by this Court, this Court in our view took great pains to distinguish the full-crew law decisions to point out for example that those laws do require such impediments of interstate commerce, which are stopping a state lines to pick up crew members.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.107" offset="1791770">But that those impediments were not of a kind, it made them constitutionally invalid, and pointed out that there in lay the distinction with the Southern Pacific against Arizona burden on commerce kind of rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.515" offset="1841403">The next consideration by this Court of the Arkansas full-crew law was in 1966, in this same case.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.417" offset="1868988">And I suggest that the off coast to the court on the preemption issue, which was the primary question at that time, the lower court had ruled against this on preemption, and we appeal and this Court reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.271" offset="1924472">And in considering a preemption question, the opinion of Mr. Justice Black noted particularly that in view of Norwood and the previous cases, that even the preemption issue was presented narrowly, that it has specific things happens since 1933, to change the 1933 decision about preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.275" offset="2004511">The Court found in the '61 decision, it had not.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.997" offset="2019349">The law was upheld, the discrimination against the interstate commerce argumentally with the railroads in 1966 was also rejected on the record before the Court at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.509" offset="2057383">Further, all recent reported decision on the same issues by course of other jurisdictions, outside of a decision we're appealing from here today, have upheld the constitutionality of similar laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.322" offset="2112658">The Indiana Supreme Court refused even to take evidence on change of conditions, saying it's a matter for the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.026" offset="2139512">The Ohio open courts rejected all the identical constitutional contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.349" offset="2160724">The New York Courts were extremely persuasive opinions, analyzed at great length that New York full-crew statute is very similar to those of Arkansas at time of the trial, rejected the railroad arguments, upheld the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.037" offset="2215476">It was affirmed by the appellate division, and about two weeks ago, it was affirmed 4 to 3 by the New York Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.839" offset="2250689">The record here is massive and it is extremely difficult to brief or argue the detailed facts of dozens and dozens of witnesses who gave opinions and reasons for their opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.651" offset="2309935">Pages and pages, and exhibits and huge exchanges of information about railroading.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.148" offset="2351940">I question whether would be advisable in any event to reiterate the intensive discussions about the duties of firemen, duties of brakemen and switchmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.072" offset="2391646">That discussion has been engaged in so many times by so many tribunals and have been substantially the same that there's argument on both sides, that there is room for judgment by reasonable men on both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.007" offset="2439398">The judgment in this instance of the State of Arkansas on its legislative process was that it is important to the safety of the state to have these statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.730" offset="2474297">As to the duty of the fireman, the most notable kind of situation is that firemen, in the sense of a man shoveling coal into a great have long time seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.392" offset="2520900">The firemen in the sense of maintaining the mode of power, providing inspection and lookout in relief and emergency duties have under sophisticated modern conditions of railroading have and continued to exercise is extremely important functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.174" offset="2584116">As to brakemen, the outstanding conclusion from the extensive record in this case is a brakemen do substantially now what they get in 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.001" offset="2619329">They do a substantially, then the Court said what they did in 1916 and 1911, the previous analysis of this statute by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.800" offset="2654542">As to equipment and facilities, the evidence is that certainly there have been some improvements in railroad conditions, railroad equipment or railroad facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.574" offset="2697697">Certainly as well, there have been some factors which have made railroading more dangerous than railroading was in 1933 and 1960, and 1911, and 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.902" offset="2738970">There are faster and longer, and heavier trains, which are deteriorating, and deteriorate the equipment and the crossings over which they pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.086" offset="2771675">There is this factor combined with items like heavier highway traffic, the school bus program, for example in Arkansas, the record shows, was unknown at the time of the Norwood case.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.200" offset="2812217">Now, it's a large program involving the transportation of hundreds or thousand of children over the crossing of these trains passed.</text>

            <text syncTime="684.491" offset="2841370">Mr. Youngdahl, I gather your position is that whatever maybe the merits and all of these arguments or the bearing of these facts upon the question, it's nothing for courts to be concerned with that the Arkansas legislature is (Inaudible), is that it?</text>

            <text syncTime="713.066" offset="2955682">Well, it's not for the Arkansas legislation that it's determined, how much to -- in its unbridled discretion, how much to burden the interstate commerce, is it?</text>

            <text syncTime="722.612" offset="2993821">My response to that would be this, that the first evaluation is by the Arkansas legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.081" offset="3019734">The second evaluation is judicial if it has not had held from Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.753" offset="3038333">In this instance, there is a legislative evaluation of a kind of thing which this Court did in Southern Pacific against Arizona for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.353" offset="3072815">The intensive/extensive evidence was taken on the importance of crews to safety before Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.511" offset="3105416">And the last decision of this Court analyze some of that legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.520" offset="3129448">Congress decided expressly, at least in expressed legislative history, not to preempt, still this Court found.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.291" offset="3160586">The reason for that decision, we would submit is a determination on the merit if there's some ground for states making these decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.771" offset="3198412">I would suggest that that would be of considerable impact of the evaluation of this Court, even under the burden on commerce argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="793.214" offset="3276257">Perhaps I might refer briefly to them right now because I had not intended to later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.271" offset="3300498">Both of them say that they are classifications, which are somehow rigid.</text>

            <text syncTime="805.856" offset="3326830">Our first argument as to those is that those questions have been resolved before.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.381" offset="3344906">The primary basis for the exemption argument, the 50 and 100-miliage of track made by the railroads is that exempt company switch over the same crossings is non-exempt companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.538" offset="3393494">This exact point was discussed and was a major element of discussion.</text>

            <text syncTime="866.887" offset="3570918">Well, we can think of several things, the record shows the following kind of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.274" offset="3588472">The smaller companies have lower speeds, whereas the companies that are appellees in this case go 75 miles an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.007" offset="3627447">The only evidence in the record on the exempted company shows speed limits of 35 miles an hour for the company I happen to recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.367" offset="3660884">The evidence shows that the railroads represented as the appellees in this case have trains of a 150 cars long.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.349" offset="3696724">Whereas the trains represented by the exempted companies, the record shows, have consistently shorter trains.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.146" offset="3723995">For example, it is customarily the movement of one or two, or five, or seven cars of this Court in Southern Pacific against Arizona, recognizing -- recognized the increase danger involved in longer trains.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.990" offset="3779375">The 50-mile railroad company exemption has been repeatedly upheld by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.676" offset="3814066">And in 1950, in Morey against Doud, this Court observed that there was particularly, that that 50-mile railroad exemption was a kind of classification, which was sustainable as contrasted with the classification which was involved in that particular case.</text>

            <text syncTime="967.986" offset="3975293">Either way it's in classification is infirmed in some way.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.982" offset="3991280">Now, as to those arguments, the record in a number of respects shows important distinctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.831" offset="4050735">Furthermore, the interstate/intrastate dichotomy does not fit the exemption dichotomy.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.805" offset="4078634">In other words, there are interstate railroad not covered by the statute because they do not have 50 or 100 miles of line and vice versa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.277" offset="4112488">And so it is not a perfect as the railroads would probably suggest, but the facts of the record show that it's not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.508" offset="4145403">Again, it seems to me that the class of that particular railroad classification principle by mileage of track has been upheld for a hundred years in respect to regulatory statutes and safety statute by this Court.</text>

            <label>Mr. James E. Youngdahl</label>
            <text syncTime="1033.749" offset="4238399">Yes Your Honor and the long opinion in the case of the opinion of Supreme Court, the trial court, which is a very careful discussion of that to deal in detail with it, I do not recall whether or not the Court of Appeals refer to that particular thing or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.790" offset="4302555">One further aspect to the 50 to 100-mile classification, which would support the classification that such in our view, the railroads have make a great argument of the fact that the cost of compliance is high.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.030" offset="4359502">I would like to say something about that in a moment, but if the cost of compliance is a factor and clearly it could be, the smaller railroad companies as I suppose are less able to assume the cost of compliance with these statutes and that might legitimately be a factor in a classification, not one which we would rely on wholly but certainly a factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.592" offset="4445706">Outside of the multitude of evidence on the duties of employees and the equipment and facilities of the railroads, the most persuasive part of a record altogether in our view is a mass of statistical material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.673" offset="4510072">This is the first time in Arkansas full-crew law cases of a many that have been in this Court and the first time in any full-crew law case and other jurisdiction that I know of, where we now have experienced to look at, because in April 1964, with the effect of the 1963 legislation of Congress, railroads did in fact reduced their operating crew substantially.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.248" offset="4608397">Most firemen were taken off at a very rapid rate and a good many in a slower rate, brakemen and switchmen were taken off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.590" offset="4641729">As a result of that, we have now a period of time to look at and I submit that the statistics from this period are most persuasive about the connection between these statutes and safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.161" offset="4688018">And at the very least, establish the right of the Arkansas legislature and the Arkansas people, because it's also been voted on populatory in Arkansas to make the cause and effect determination, resulting from those statistics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.844" offset="4742771">Clearly from this evidence that railroading is a very hazardous business and continues to be, clearly number two, that beginning in April 1964 many crewmen have been take off of trains nationally, large percentage dropped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.081" offset="4811734">Three, clearly since April 1964 or May, railroad accidents have increased substantially.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.468" offset="4837230">And number four, that when you analyze those accidents and you find those that are most attributable to crew side and crew performance, those accidents have increased, especially and the rate of those accidents have increased especially.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.984" offset="4903267">Now, a causal -- a cause and effect decision we say as primarily legislative, but there are some things to assist in that kind of evaluation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.059" offset="4939630">For example, collisions, it is conceded by all the parties that collisions are that type of accidents, most attributable to crew performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.149" offset="4979963">Accidents went up -- have gone up for a period of time, but beginning exactly at the time when many most firemen were taken off of freight trains in this country, collisions sky rocketed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.542" offset="5025520">The rate of increase changed entirely as to collisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.546" offset="5049553">For example further, causes of accidents, causes such as disregard of stop signals, failure to secure handbrakes, running through switches, failure of the engineer to keep a look out, that kind of thing, most attributable to employee performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.948" offset="5111202">The rate of such accidents, accidents from such causes also rose sharply beginning in April or May 1964, extremely important causal factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.018" offset="5163447">Now, the railroads are hardpressed to answer this kind of testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.517" offset="5177448">They answer it partly by using improper statistical techniques.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.558" offset="5189569">For example, let's say casualties have not gone up, because they measure casualties by billion grossed ton-miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.005" offset="5215378">A kind of exposure factor which no one else uses and even the railroads and other context, the record shows do not use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.129" offset="5243904">They compare one year with another one year, instead of comparing periods of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.901" offset="5263026">The claimant there had been reporting defects and that the amount of train accident, dollar damage, in order to justify a report has stayed constant for the last several years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.877" offset="5302836">But the fact that the Department of Transportation of the United States Government has found a startling and alarming rise and it repeatedly has told Congress that we need assistance in the railroad accidents field, which in the last few years had become more and more serious to the point of real dangerous calamity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.863" offset="5382875">They say that the accident rate was increasing all along, but again it's possible to isolate that kind of accident, which is most attributable to crew performance, and furthermore the rate of the increase that the Department of Transportation notes, the rate of increase has gone up higher in the years, since 1964 than it have been going up since that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.101" offset="5467826">But even under the railroad statistics, comparing 1962 and 1966, the railroads with more firemen had a smaller increase in the collision rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.123" offset="5503875">Over the largest reported in a full-crew states had better accident and casualty rate experience than non full-crew states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.227" offset="5532296">Arkansas train accidents have been increasing at a slower rate than state with smaller operating crews.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.915" offset="5555075">During the period with the same traffic density, casualty rates are no less for diesel and for steam locomotives, and comparing pre-1964 and post-1964 experience, Arkansas now have a smaller percentage of the national casualties, during the time where those crew sides had been proportionately larger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.847" offset="5642742">One aspect of a railroad's case which we contend they have totally failed to prove, is the aspect of cost of compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.385" offset="5676910">Both in Commerce Clause, the burden on commerce cases and in due process cases, the cost of compliance had been a major consideration by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.001" offset="5727378">The standards for the full-crew cases have been laid out expressly and in detail by this Court, in the 1931 Norwood decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.192" offset="5764159">This Court pointed out that it's not enough to say why we have to spend so much money last year, but there has to be a relative cost factor presented to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.801" offset="5806582">It has to relate to the operation of those employees per ton, per car, per mile, per something, and to say that we spent $5.00 more this year than we spent in last, has no due process relevance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.527" offset="5873455">The railroads have this in front of them and yet, they totally failed to acknowledge in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.620" offset="5893831">They simply put an evidence saying we spent $7 million in Arkansas in 1966 or 1965 in complying with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.847" offset="5926745">And on cross examination, they said, “Well, we added up all the wages of the firemen and all the wages of the third brakemen or switchmen and that's $7 million.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.590" offset="5965720">Now, that alone is not enough, but we have more in this record, which reveal the deficiency as to this aspect of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.918" offset="5999052">We have accidentally the operating papers used by one of appellee railroads, Kansas City Southern, in making their cost of compliance calculations, in which the actual mileage expense in Arkansas for train crewmen, people in the back part of the train, and for engine crewmen, the firemen and the engineer is presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.421" offset="6081076">And the startling result, totally uncontradictory in this record, the startling result from these figures is that Kansas City Southern did not experience any increase, in cost of compliance per mile of Arkansas railroading after the change in national crews in the other states in which operates and up-to-date or up to the period covered in the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.242" offset="6180342">In other words, railroads have failed generally as to this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.473" offset="6201240">When we look farther towards the kind of formulas which Norwood command, we find there's some evidence and that evidence show that there's no cost of compliance at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.496" offset="6241364">I found as startling when I first heard it and we began to inquire and there's evidence about what some of the causes might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.742" offset="6270307">Certainly, the railroads have ignored for example the fact that in places where engineers ride without a fireman or firemen are not required, the have to pay an extra allowance to the engineers, ignored completely by the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.718" offset="6322239">Certainly, everyone can see in the record, and the railroads make a big point of this in their briefs, that with a smaller crew, it takes a longer time to operate a train, with a longer time, it kicks in certain constructive and progressive allowances, which the people who are on the crew have to be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.945" offset="6395173">Certainly, there is substantial evidence in which the Court, I'm certain that legislative could conclude that the accident rate goes up startlingly with a smaller crew, and that this perhaps account for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.887" offset="6438954">But in any event, the only evidence showing related cost of compliance, not related to one year to other as a railroads argue, but related as to the kind of performance of these crew members shows that there is virtually no cost of compliance at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.336" offset="6520665">This is in our view a perfect case for the application of the principle that this Court does not fit as a super legislature, and a perfect illustration of why that is so is the opinion of a court below, because the opinion of the court below is no more or less in our view than a report of a committee, a legislative committee saying why they would like to change the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.523" offset="6621497">It does not as was the Norwood case, it does not as was the New York case a careful fact by fact, detail by detail analysis of what firemen do and what brakemen do, and what locomotives do, and what the crossing hazards are and all those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.365" offset="6692864">It is rather a general discussion of why the judges think that the full-crew library economically unwise, why are they unhappy with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.161" offset="6732048">They say for example that we suspect their primary paragraph on the evidence in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.014" offset="6755453">It says the record is voluminous and massive, and there are films and pictures and testimony of dozens and dozens of witnesses, and depositions and so on, and said, “We are not going to make any attempt to discuss this."</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.985" offset="6799339">Probably, we suspect that much of it is surplusage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.327" offset="6816684">How can a court suspect that massive record is surplusage, if it has made a factual analysis?</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.380" offset="6844897">An an analysis which would properly underlie a conclusion that there is no conceivable germane connection between a legitimate state purpose, the safety of its public and it's railroad men and the statue in question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1984.519" offset="8041409">I suppose it is not often that a lawyer, even a country lawyer comes to this (Inaudible) chamber and conceived (Inaudible) that he is not prepared to discuss the intricacies of the record or the law in a particular case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2049.004" offset="8299395">And that the people all convinced that these full-crew acts are necessary, as well as desirable, both for the safety of the travelers in the state and for the welfare of railroad employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.716" offset="8370239">The fact that attorneys for the State of Arkansas have not been deeply involved in the details of this case, should not be construed by any means to indicate that the state is disinterested in the outcome thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.532" offset="8465533">The appellees have suggested in their brief that the state has made a minimum presentation and that that minimum presentation indicates some absence of conviction on the points.</text>

            <text syncTime="2363.015" offset="9555466">In my presentation I'll touch on some points concerning the history of this case and also on the legal standards applied by the court below in reaching the unanimous conclusions that are contained in its opinion and decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.389" offset="9620877">I'll also discuss some phases of the proof that led the District Court to conclude that these statutes in practical operation bear no reasonable relationship to the safety of railroad operations as they are today conducted over the United States and particularly as they are conducted today in Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.116" offset="9699871">And finally, I'll briefly discuss our position that these statutes constitute an impermissible discrimination against interstate commerce entirely aside from the undue burden against commerce argument and also that they violate the Equal Protection Clause.The District Court find it unnecessary to pass on either of these constitutional challenges because it found the statues to be clearly unconstitutional on two other distinct grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.459" offset="9821184">My colleague Mr. Lucente will expand the discussion of the factual basis for the findings of the court below, which will include these statistical evidence relating to the safety of railroad operations as it bears on the question of whether the minimum crew required by these Arkansas statutes of six men on both freight and switch crews makes any contribution to railroad safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.000" offset="9931421">He'll discuss the findings of the many boards, commissions and other quasi-judicial public bodies that have tried and decided substantially the identical fact issues that are presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.226" offset="9992234">And finally, he'll describe the staggering burden of these statutes to the appellee railroads in terms of cost of compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.543" offset="10029537">When this case was before the Court on the earlier appeal about two years ago, the appellants took the position that the constitutional challenges were so insubstantial as to make the case an inappropriate one for three-judge District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.527" offset="10097455">This Court rejected that argument and remanded the case to the District Court for trial and determination of the constitutional issues, which of course have had not undertaken to decide in draining the summary judgment that it had earlier entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.751" offset="10170389">As we understand the plain language of this Court's decision on the earlier appeal it simply meant that the complaint filed in this case in April of 1964 sufficiently alleged facts that would cause these statutes to be unconstitutional if those facts were proven and if the railroad companies could prove what they'd alleged in the complaint, they were entitled to the relief sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.639" offset="10281880">It was in this context that the District Court on remand scheduled and then undertook a massive trial on a massive record, as Mr. Youngdahl indicates, over a hundred witnesses testified, a tremendous volume of other evidence and exhibits were received by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.289" offset="10356485">All directed toward permitting the District Court to decide the central factual issue of whether these Arkansas statutes in practical operation today really have any rational relationship to railroad safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.209" offset="10432240">I stressed that the issues addressed to the District Court were almost entirely factual and not legal as that Court indicated in its own opinion, the opinion from which this appeal is prosecuted, that the governing legal principles are clear and indeed are not substantially disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.665" offset="10502040">And the Court then based on the massive record before it made this factual finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.705" offset="10530147">We find from the overwhelming weight of the evidence by the mid-1950s, if not before, the firemen on a diesel locomotive and the third brakemen or helper had in general seized to perform significant safety functions in the operation and switching of freight trains and cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.118" offset="10607888">Those findings of fact on this record supporting those findings of fact led inevitably in applying the constitutional principles that have been established by this Court to the lower court's central holding in this case, which was at under present conditions continued enforcement of the statutes makes no significant contribution to railroad safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.382" offset="10696913">And that statutes as they operate today are unreasonable and oppressive and violate the Due Process Clause and unconstitutionally burden interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.241" offset="10740381">I should note that the District Court of three judges in this case did not follow the example of the Norwood case and refer the matter to a special master.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.393" offset="10776952">Although quite obviously, it was going to involve a very extensive accumulation of the factual record but the three judges chose to hear the case because of the factual context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.151" offset="10820002">It's necessary for them to pass on the credibility of the witnesses and of course, they enjoyed the superior position of being able to do that of hearing the witnesses that were actually presented and assessing the weight that was to be given to their conflicting claims or conflicting testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.828" offset="10894712">The validity of these statutes has always turned on a fact question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.437" offset="10917073">The Norwood case in 1933 involved the same sort of examination of the facts in the District Court after it had been remanded back to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.749" offset="10966392">The accumulation of the sort of record that we have here today only on 1929, 1930, and 1931 railroad operating facts, and then the appeal from the conclusion of the Court at that time, the District Court, that there wasn't sufficient change to make the statutes then unreasonable, there wasn't sufficient improvement in railroad technology and safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.802" offset="11078614">When the appeal was taken from that, this Court regarded the entire matter as factual and in per curiam, once in its opinion, it said we see no reason to disagree with the determinations of fact of the District Court, the decree is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.647" offset="11146010">We submit respectfully that that would be an entirely appropriate disposition of the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.008" offset="11179447">The substance very briefly of the proof in this great record, and to make it perfectly clear, this is a very much abbreviated portion of the record, abbreviated by agreement of the parties, only typical extracts of the testimony and typical exhibits have put in here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.246" offset="11252381">I would suspect that the whole record if printed would be six or seven times the volume of the three volumes that were printed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.876" offset="11290833">The substance of that proof is that these railroads now before the Court, these six railroads and all the other American railroads are operating all over the United States with crews of less than the minimum of six required by the two Arkansas laws and that they've done it without sacrifice of safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.707" offset="11374216">The appellee railroads operations outside of the State of Arkansas are down with crews of three and four and in some infrequent situations, five with no sacrifice of safety.</text>

            <text syncTime="3307.348" offset="13332773">Justice Stewart, the New York had three crew concess statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.865" offset="13350849">One requiring a freight crew, as I recalled six, and one requiring of switch crew as I recall five.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.479" offset="13381256">It repealed those two statutes two years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.900" offset="13394944">All three statutes were attacked in their lawsuit which began back in '63 or '64 and after the trial court had entered its decisions, sustaining all three, the legislature repeal those two leaving only the statute that required a firemen in engine crews under many circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.786" offset="13470490">The District Court tested the constitutional standards, are tested against the constitutional standards established by this Court, these laws under both the due process and Commerce Clause grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.981" offset="13527333">It correctly apprehended that the statute would be valid if they were reasonably related to the safety of operations and if there were unduly oppressive or restrictive or costly in comparison the benefits if any that they conferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.092" offset="13587728">And the Court acknowledged that if the reasonableness of the statutes remained after an assessment of the evidence fairly debatable, the statutes would be sustained, because that court like this one does not sit to pass a legislative judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.899" offset="13643003">But it found that conceding as late as Norwood that the statutes, the reasonableness of the statutes in that factual context 35 years ago was reasonably debatable that it does not continue to be debatable today on this record and that the continued debate of it by the brotherhoods does not make it so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.983" offset="13739342">On the Commerce Clause test, the Court observed that since the statutes had a distinct impact on interstate commerce, it was required to make the judicial appraisal to weigh the purported local benefits to be derived from the statutes against the national interest in an unfettered flow of interstate commerce free from local restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.747" offset="13854386">It relied on this Court's decision in the Southern Pacific against Arizona case, where the Court found on the factual record made there that the safety benefits from the Arizona train link laws were so -- I'm trying to think of the phrase, because I think it's significant, so slight or problematical as not to outweigh the national interest in an unfettered commerce and the train link law was declared unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.597" offset="13981759">The Court also relied on Morgan against Virginia decided a year later where the Court measuring the validity of a statue requiring the separation of passengers on interstate conveyances by race against the Commerce Clause only, that was the context in which it was presented, gave great stress to the need and desirability for uniformity of regulation of interstate commerce and found that uniformity in that sort of regulation, ordering the seating of passengers on interstate conveyances was desirable in a constitutional sense and that the statutes therefore must fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.656" offset="14134000">I point out that the burden here on interstate commerce of the full-crew laws is far greater and the impact far greater than that of the statute in Morgan against Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.102" offset="14179767">There, the passengers could move in accommodation to conflicting state regulations as the conveyance move from state to state and the conveyance didn't have to be stopped and presumably no cost was incurred to the interstate commerce in complying with that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.049" offset="14247581">Here, the trains must stop or slow to comply with the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.673" offset="14262105">Here, the impact of the cost of compliance is overwhelming.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.660" offset="14282062">The Court concluded and we submit correctly so that the statutes are not reasonably related to safety and that that's not fairly debatable in light of present day railroad operations and it concluded that any contribution that these statutes might be argued to make to safety would be entirely out of proportion and is entirely out of proportion to the purported benefits they concur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.643" offset="14417899">It's suggested in the appellant's brief that an economic justification can be offered as alternative to support the validity of these statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.402" offset="14468995">The case made below with the factual case made below is so unwaived that the appellants feel they need to offer an alternative at this stage and in their motion to intervene, they've setup what that alternative was, what their interest in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.444" offset="14565125">They said their interest was that they represented the employees whose jobs were protected by these statutes and who might lose their jobs if the statutes were repealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.202" offset="14600129">And they also had the further interest that if they had a diminution of membership as result of the clarity and validity of these statutes, it would cost them a loss of income, it cause the organization, the brotherhoods a loss of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.943" offset="14663137">The District Court rejected that argument and said that the earlier cases including the decisions of this Court had authoritatively characterized each statutes as safety statutes and safety statutes alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.907" offset="14710993">The Supreme Court and then it accepted that characterization and indicated that the statutes might well be violative of the Constitution of Arkansas if it was attempted to measure or support them on an economic justification rather than safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.343" offset="14776717">The Supreme Court of Arkansas said in the first one these cases coming before it in 1908 that this legislation can only be supported on account of its supposed promotion of safety of the public and the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.325" offset="14836694">This Court in its 1916 case, referring to both of these statutes, the 1907 and 1913 statute said that they were designed for the purpose of ensuring or promoting railroad safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.166" offset="14887999">This entire case, as well as all of these other crew concess cases litigated over the years have been and has been litigated on the issue of safety, that's what the proof in this massive record went to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.558" offset="14937631">And as I've earlier noted, the seven justices of the New York Court of Appeals were unanimous on that issue alone that the statute had the standard followed based on its contribution to safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.829" offset="14990712">Of all the evidence in the record, the most persuasive and most dramatic I think of the absurdities of these statutes and of the real impact they have on interstate commerce are these absurd rituals at or near the Arkansas state line, they require in putting on and taken off men as a train moves from another state into Arkansas or through the Arkansas unto another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.839" offset="15102725">There are many examples of these extra employees placed on the train for the sole purpose of complying on the Arkansas statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.505" offset="15137416">One of the best and I'll cite only one in interest of time is the run of Southern Pacific Railroad Company from the Coffeyville, Kansas to Van Buren, Arkansas, which passes through on most of these run, it's ran through the State of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.879" offset="15198856">From Coffeyville, Kansas to Greenwood Junction, Arkansas, the train is operated by four-men crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="3781.320" offset="15228635">At Greenwood Junction, the train is stopped, two additional employees climbed aboard and ride the train for the balance of the journey in Van Buren, Arkansas consisting of six miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.676" offset="15278059">On the northward trip, exactly the same thing in reverse is done, a six-man crew takes the train out of Arkansas for six miles to Greenwood Junction, Oklahoma, where two men get off the train, ride a taxi back to town and four men take the train through Oklahoma to Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.351" offset="15348799">There are many examples in the record of this, the same thing as illustrated by the yards of these railroads where the state line bisects the yards.</text>

            <text syncTime="3945.209" offset="15884204">Under safety issue, the District Court made several critical findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3949.413" offset="15901027">It found first that from the overwhelming weight of the evidence that since the mid-1950s, neither the firemen on the diesel locomotive nor the third brakemen or helper contributed to safety of railroad operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3965.925" offset="15967065">The District Court also found without regard to employee categories that trains have been operated safely in other parts of the United States for many years, with crews of less than six men that size required by the Arkansas statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3983.244" offset="16036342">And that the training operations with these small crews had been conducted with safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3988.946" offset="16059120">And finally, the District Court concluded from the evidence as a whole, under present conditions, continued enforcement of the statutes makes no significant contribution to railroad safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="4003.409" offset="16117008">In reaching these conclusions and making these findings, the District Court relied heavily on evidence, have comparable and safe operations with smaller crews.</text>
            <text syncTime="4015.246" offset="16164342">In other cases involving identical issues, the courts have relied on the same type of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4022.369" offset="16192867">In the Warrenburg case which is referred to and discussed in our brief, the Court relied on evidence of comparable and safe operations with 44 ton yards switching diesels without a fireman and found the ordinance requiring a fireman on that type of equipment to be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="4040.370" offset="16264861">In the Southern Pacific case particularly, this Court relied extensively on evidence of safe operations in states outside of Arizona, operating three of the 70 car limitation imposed by Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="4057.080" offset="16331734">And it concluded on the basis of such safe operations in other states that the Arizona limitation had no reasonable relation to safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="4067.533" offset="16373530">The record in the present case permits the same type of comparison and strongly supports the District Court's conclusion that the statutory requirements at issue do not promote safety of operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4080.910" offset="16427029">This comparative evaluation is greatly facilitated by the changes in crew size, which have occurred since 1964 as a result of the award of arbitration board number 282.</text>
            <text syncTime="4093.846" offset="16478751">That award which was applicable to virtually every major railroad in the United States has resulted in the elimination of a majority of the firemen's positions and a reduction in the number of brakemen and helpers used on crews in road and yard service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4109.799" offset="16542595">There's also available for the same period of time, extensive data relating to safety of operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4117.298" offset="16572583">This data permits a comparison of the safety of railroad operations over a period of time, and it also permits a geographic comparison between states.</text>
            <text syncTime="4127.517" offset="16613439">And when this information, with respect to safety of operations is properly related to the change in crew size which have occurred since 1964, it is possible to draw conclusions as to the relative safety of operations with crews of different sizes under comparable conditions.</text>

            <text syncTime="4156.528" offset="16729527">Our basic point is that the extra men required do not make any contribution to safety, the operation is as safe with the four-man crew as it is with the six-man crew.</text>

            <text syncTime="4168.781" offset="16778533">Because that kind of a claim could be and apparently was made in the Arizona case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4174.184" offset="16800057">The claim that that being the state law that's limited to length of trains, limited to numbers of freight cars in a train.</text>
            <text syncTime="4181.880" offset="16830882">The claim being that if there were shorter trains, there would be more trains and therefore, more great crossing accidents and so on, you haven't got that argument available.</text>

            <text syncTime="4190.572" offset="16865677">No, we don't have that argument here, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4195.239" offset="16884276">Perhaps the most graphic of the comparisons which the record permits involves the Arkansas operations of the plaintiff railroads in this case and their operations in other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="4207.148" offset="16931924">As these railroads reduced the crews under the provisions of the award of arbitration board number 282, it became and it remains common place for trains and through service on this railroads to operate with identical characteristics through Arkansas and adjacent states, except for differences in crew size, the size of the train, its motor power, the frequency or infrequency of stops, the characteristics of tracks, signal protection and terrain remain incomparable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4239.278" offset="17060446">Only the size of the crew changes from the four-man crew in other states to the six-man crew required by the Arkansas statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4248.078" offset="17095659">Trains of the Frisco Railroad operating over its main line to Missouri, Arkansas, on Tennessee undergo these crew changes as they pass in to Weiner of Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4258.436" offset="17137142">Trains of the Rock Island operating from Tennessee to New Mexico have the same experience, going from four-man crews in other states to six-man crews in Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4268.444" offset="17177161">And the Missouri Pacific and Cotton Belt have a large volume of interstate operations, which also proceeds identical in operating features and characteristics, except for differences in crew size.</text>
            <text syncTime="4283.139" offset="17235884">Now, in yard services, Mr. Light has pointed out there are instances where a border bisects the yard and where four-man crews do a switching in one part of the yard and six-man crew do the switching on occasions when they are required to go into Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4300.142" offset="17303907">The other part of the record on this, in addition to the changes in crew size is the evidence which shows the relative safety of operations of the plaintiff railroads in Arkansas and in other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="4315.209" offset="17364198">The record shows that during the five-year period, which the most recent five-year period available at the time of the trial, from 1961 to 1966, casualties arising from train operations were reduced by 13% in Arkansas and 16% in other states through which the plaintiff railroads operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4336.746" offset="17450402">I'm referring now to the reportable causalities comprehended by the regulations of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4343.189" offset="17476106">Casualties were reduced in both Arkansas and in other states, but the reduction in other states on the plaintiff railroad is greater than in Arkansas.</text>

            <text syncTime="4355.942" offset="17527097">Yes, accidents Your Honor are comprehended under the Interstate Commerce Commission term of train accidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4362.877" offset="17554892">A train accident to be reportable to the Interstate Commerce Commission must involve one basic requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4369.960" offset="17583208">It must involve property damage to railroad equipment arising out of the operation of trains of at least $750.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="4378.704" offset="17618213">Since 1961, there has been a trend of increases in train accidents reportable to the commission, and train accidents also comprehend collisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4389.401" offset="17660949">Collisions are one of the categories within the train accident category.</text>
            <text syncTime="4394.107" offset="17679757">There has been an increase in train accidents reportable to the Interstate Commerce Commission since 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="4401.750" offset="17710373">But the fact is that casualties, injuries to people arising out of those incidents has been declining since 1961, so that by 1967, there's a 25% reduction in the casualties or injuries to people arising from these train accidents.</text>

            <text syncTime="4420.294" offset="17784560">Might not that be fortuitous, just the fact that you didn't have to happen to have any very large accidents that killed a great number of people and might not that be -- might not that also be to the fact the railroads have taken off most of their passenger trains, where people might be killed?</text>

            <label>Mr. Martin M. Lucente</label>
            <text syncTime="4442.360" offset="17872854">The evidence, Your Honor, shows that the reason for this increase in reportable train accidents is primarily the fact that the standard is stated in terms of damage to equipment and that one of the features involved in determining the damage to equipment is the amount of cost involved in repairing the equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4462.360" offset="17952789">And this $750.00 standard, which has remained inflexible since 1961, has resulted in an increasing number of incidents falling within the reporting requirements, as equipment cost had increased, as labor cost have gone up, the proportion of incidences, in which in this -- becomes a reportable train accident has also increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="4487.942" offset="18055189">So that the basic point that the record establishes in this connection, is that in so far as safety is concerned, in terms of injuries to people, that there has been improvement in that and that there has been at least a comparable improvement in states which do not require six-man crews.</text>

            <text syncTime="4506.428" offset="18129063">Don't you -- couldn't that be a direct reflection of the fact that there are fewer people in the crew?</text>
            <text syncTime="4511.671" offset="18150066">In a train accident, the people most likely to be hurt are the crew of the train, if there are only four in there instead of six, that would account for fewer (Voice Overlap).</text>

            <text syncTime="4520.167" offset="18184025">That could account for some of them Your Honor, but the fact is that only a very small number of train accidents have a potential for casualties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4529.875" offset="18222895">The reported data for 1967 shows approximately 7200 train accidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4536.654" offset="18249958">The reportable casualties for 1967 to persons arising out of train accidents is 924, when -- so on its phase, the 924 against the 7000 produces something in the vicinity of 10% of train accidents that result in casualties of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="4559.242" offset="18340342">And when the casualties in train accidents are allocated to specific accidents, so that you take into account the fact that some produce two casualties, others do not produce any, only 6.5% of the train accidents involve casualties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4574.554" offset="18401573">So, our basic point is that the discussion of train accidents, the emphasis and what has happened to train accidents, is a concern with the mishaps involving property damage, which become increasingly reportable because of the yard stick, which I referred.</text>

            <text syncTime="4619.395" offset="18580982">The commission's classification of collisions also includes collisions from one car raking the side of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="4626.538" offset="18609507">And it includes and they are reported as a great many collisions, what happens when a car goes over the hump in the yard at too greater speed, runs into another car at the receiving track and the classification yard and property damage of $750.00 occurs.</text>

            <label>Mr. James E. Youngdahl</label>
            <text syncTime="5717.173" offset="22972061">In the appendix it was pages 419 to 500, a testimony of Mr. Homer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5722.678" offset="22994108">There were charts , particular charts involving collisions on many pages, including pages 11, 68 to 69, and those are discussed thoroughly in pages 48 through 53 of our original brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5735.646" offset="23045935">The railroad suggest that the whole matter here can be explained in terms of reporting requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="5742.236" offset="23072266">I point to pages 6 and 7 of our reply brief, with the Department of Transportation quotation, in pages -- issued on April 10, 1968, deals with the matter of railroad accidents and their alarming circumstances, under present and recently developed conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5761.127" offset="23147917">Same thing such as the national transportation safety board review of data, during the past several years for train accidents shows progressively worsening trend in rates, occurrences, deaths, and damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="5774.567" offset="23201625">Now, as the Court observed in questioning Mr. Lucente, the fact that the casualties may have dropped, could be explained by many thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5783.808" offset="23238614">Now, it was a very easy way to handle that, used as an exposure factor, as a factor for measuring casualties main hours, that's what everybody uses as the record shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="5793.915" offset="23279052">That's what the railroad use in other context, but here they chose to measure casualties by such things as billion gross ton miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="5801.759" offset="23310399">Obviously, the ton miles per employee is going up great as the crews go down, as passengers go down, as passengers crews go down, as maintenance of rail employees go down, etcetera and as car loading increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5816.046" offset="23367555">Obviously, when you measure casualties in terms of billion gross ton miles, you're going to get some kind of a drop, but casualties in terms of some of kind meaningful explanation do not at all result, the fact is they have risen along with train accidents since 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="5833.779" offset="23438503">But in any event, about all these statistics, and all of this information, there's a great deal of it in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5839.139" offset="23459924">It seems to us that this is a peculiarly legislative decision, the cause and effect kind of thing, deciding whether it really was caused or really wasn't caused by something which follow another.</text>
            <text syncTime="5850.574" offset="23505690">And we submit that this is a matter for the Arkansas legislature to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="5854.393" offset="23520946">We concede that there's been trend, legislative trend to eliminate full-crew law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5860.174" offset="23544038">We think we can reverse it with these statistics I just been talking about, and we look forward to any opportunity we have on that respect, but hoped that it not be done to this traditional process.</text>
