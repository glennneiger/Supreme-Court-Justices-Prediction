            <label>Mr. David T. Goldstick</label>
            <text syncTime="30.380" offset="224841">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.926" offset="239052">This is an appeal from a conviction of the Criminal Court of the City of New York, where an appellant was convicted for malicious mischief.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.286" offset="276564">And that he be filed and cast contempt upon and burned an American flag in violation of Section 1425 (16) (d), of the New York State Penal Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.970" offset="331212">The charge was that he did willfully set fire to and burn the American flag and shout, “If they did that to James Meredith, We don't need and American Flag”.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.152" offset="367992">The judgment was unanimously affirmed by the appellant term of the Supreme Court of New York without decision, and in turn, the Judgment unanimously affirmed by the Court of Appeals, Judge Fuld rendering the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.746" offset="418356">The statute in question is set forth in page 5 of appellant's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.370" offset="440822">I might, at the Halter say that we agreed completely with Justice Fuld when he states that the central issue in this case is whether or not the deliberate act of burning an American flag in public as a protest maybe punished as a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.652" offset="509994">Parenthetically, we believed there was another issue that was raised then and that is raised here today, that assuming that New York State may punish such an act as a crime, may it do it under the statute in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.563" offset="561612">The facts are really undisputed, on June 6, 1966 at about 5:30 in the afternoon, Sidney Street was sitting in his apartment listening to the radio when he heard news broadcasts that James Meredith, while marching through Mississippi was shot.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.993" offset="623365">He went to his door to get an American Flag when down from his apartment to a street corner, put a piece of paper in the street folding the flag in one hand, properly fold it, put a match to it, and set it on fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.270" offset="684492">A police officer testified at the trial that he saw the smoke, came over to find out what had occurred, saw on the street corner a flag partially burned and folded lying on the ground, heard a man shouting, couldn't quite make out what he was saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.395" offset="740916">At the other street corner across the street, heard a man shout, “We don't need no damn flag!” Upon identify who the man was who it turned out to be the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.600" offset="789817">Asked him if it was his flag, the appellant said “Yes, it was my flag”, and said the words “If they did that to James Meredith, We don't need the American Flag”.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="180.749" stopTime="206.235">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="180.749" offset="826389">Mr. Goldstick, Judge Fuld and his recital of the facts and his opinions for the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.322" offset="860662">It does have a little minor error in his factual recital does he not?</text>
            <text syncTime="194.011" offset="879365">When he says that your client told the small crowd which collected that quote “if they let that happen to Meredith, We don't need an American Flag”.</text>

            <text syncTime="206.235" offset="928266">Now, we don't know if factual error then and I'll tell why Mr. Justice, because they also testified that he came over after the burning and that he questioned the person street there at the corner.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.524" offset="985422">Now, I don't know whether when he questioned him loud enough for the crowd to have heard the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.235" offset="1012276">I think we may assume that he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.296" offset="1024606">Certainly, we may assume that the crowd did hear “We don't need no damn flag”, that's without question.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.606" offset="1049788">The other words, with the records just doesn't clear Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="239.755" offset="1062431">I went to the record pretty carefully yesterday and I didn't see that there was anything to support the statement that you're client as he was burning the flag --</text>

            <label>Mr. David T. Goldstick</label>
            <text syncTime="252.314" offset="1112586">Oh that's quite so.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.495" offset="1117393">The statement was made after the act of burning was done, quite so, quite so.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.147" offset="1148008">Let me ask the Court if they will turn with me to page 5 of my brief so that we may examine the statute together and that I might point out what appellant's contentions are concerning the infirmities of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.051" offset="1207568">I turned to the subdivision d, which it says, “Shall publicly mutilate the face, the file or defy, trample or cast contempt upon either by words or act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="290.285" offset="1264515">At the outset, it becomes obvious that the insertion in the statute by words, as well as by acts, shows us that the statute on its phase restricts freedom of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.444" offset="1321148">Secondly, I would like to point out that the word “Cast Contempt Upon”, the words cast contempt upon, the word defile, the word defy, have speech meanings as well as act meanings.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.134" offset="1383946">As a matter of fact, I find difficulty in seeing where the statute does not, on it's face, have an absolute restriction on the form of verbal speech that somebody may use towards the American flag and this is born out I might say in the District Attorney's brief where he so interprets the statute even in the Court of Appeals' decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.100" offset="1487809">I asked the Court to turn with me for a moment to Judge Fuld's decision on page 8a of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.721" offset="1522291">About 12 lines from the bottom of the page, we see the observation by Chief Judge Fuld, subdivision 16 of section 1425 is designed to prevent the outbreak of such violence by discouraging contemptuous and insulting treatment of the flag and I infer from the words “treatment” that treatment certainly had contemptuous treatment of the flag maybe by word as well as by act.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.501" offset="1637334">We find that the opinions of the Mr. Harry Brodbar General the State of New York, as cited in the District Mr. Harry Brodbar's brief, seem to indicate that the statute is prohibiting words as well as acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.757" offset="1682369">In fact, it seems to go farther even then the Court of Appeals' decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.458" offset="1697207">The Mr. Harry Brodbar General seems to feel that all disrespect of any kind shown to the flag is illegal under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.313" offset="1732629">Now, the point that I'm trying to bring to this Court's attention is that this is not a fanciful observation.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.073" offset="1775679">The convictions that we had in New York over the past two years have been really real besides streets conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.165" offset="1800025">We had a conviction in the Riddick's case that is waiting appeal to the New York Court of Appeals where an owner of an art store, a displayed in his arts store in the window, some 40 odd constructions of an artist's protest against the American flag and as Judge Bissell, observed in his descent, the artist is conveying by his pictures what you or I might be able to convey by words but this is the way he can convey it best.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.433" offset="1917053">You'll notice in our reply brief, in our reply brief, we have a picture of a poster and I've noticed that Mr. Justice Stewart is taking a look at and I think maybe all of us could look at it together.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.830" offset="1970657">At two weeks ago, a police officer was--had issued a summons for violation of the statute for showing an American flag in a bookstore window and replacing on the field where the stars are the doves of peace, and the signs of peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.148" offset="2063966">Now the question has to be asked, alright what does have to do with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.912" offset="2082983">No question that streaked at something that isn't all speech, its act as well as speech and alright, suppose the statute goes too far but we should still be able to convict Street because unquestionably, New York has the power to outlaw this kind of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.406" offset="2149021">It is our position Your Honors that even if this Court took that position which we would not agree at with but assumed for a moment that we agree that the State of New York could outlaw this type of conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="522.423" offset="2193115">You know really, do you really argue that State of New York could not constitutionally outlaw the defacing of the flag by physical acts?</text>

            <text syncTime="547.882" offset="2294888">It bothers me very much and it also bothers me that a statute on its face that is so restrictive goes far beyond the limited powers that Mr. Justice Fortas is referring to, and that even if we assume that it could do what Mr. Justice Fortas says, I quite agree with you and all likely we're going to probably could.</text>

            <text syncTime="654.770" offset="2722461">Well, I would say first, we may not even have to reach that point because the statute on its face, obviously, restricts communicative acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.560" offset="2757569">So that -- even if we have for example a statute like the Federal Government recently enacted which omits completely any reference to speech except, I might point out for the word “defile” which has an interpretation having speech connotation.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.410" offset="2817024">Assume even that word was out, and we had a federal statute in question, which then have to reach the question there as to whether was constitutionally applied, but we can avoid that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.318" offset="2860596">Though, I'm prepare to speak on it because I think even if we have the federal statute of New York, that particular facts in this case would not allow a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.643" offset="2897899">But assuming for a moment, that was the statute we had, I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.816" offset="2918588">Assuming that we did not have the statute but we have the statute that we have, we don't reach the question because that's far beyond the federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.454" offset="2945233">I might point out that the honorable Ramsey Clark and I realized it is not binding in this Court at any matter whatsoever, but he still made a very have observation to Congress when they were adapting their statute that the words as used in the New York statute deter and in the proposed statute before the Congress will very much like the New York statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1899.450" offset="7701191">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.736" offset="7714356">It is the states' contention that the appellant was convicted only for the act of burning, that any reference to language is mere suffrage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.960" offset="7751241">The officers set forth some language and his information his complaint but that language is language that's usually set forth by a police officer to indicate intent on the part of the participant in the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.503" offset="7817383">It is our feeling also the language used, “if they did this to Meredith, we don't need an American flag.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.702" offset="7846222">That language is not contentious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.500" offset="7861373">Certainly, the officer wouldn't have arrested him for merely making that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.785" offset="7878510">The record is clear that the officer came to the scene because he saw a flag burned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.885" offset="7898885">He then went over to some of the people a crowd and asked them, “who burned the flag?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.059" offset="7915604">He then went to the appellant and asked the appellant whether he burned the flag?</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.628" offset="7933889">And the appellant told him, ”if they did this to Meredith, we don't need an American flag.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.577" offset="7965654">The officer then went back to the scene, the opposite corner, attempted to stamp of the fire, pick up the flag, took it to police headquarters and marked it as part of an invoice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.760" offset="8022392">By inadvertence, the flag was never marked an evidence, although, I have it here with me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.416" offset="8053008">It is obvious then that the arrest was only for the burning of the American flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.120" offset="8079862">There was another statement made by the appellant which the office had overheard, “we don't need no damn flag.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.580" offset="8113716">It is also significant that the officer did not make that part of his complaint that he ignored that statement against threatening the states position at the arrest for – was for the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.359" offset="8168782">By -- in passing, I might say that even the word -- that the words “damn flag” might would be consider contemptuous under the case of Chaplinsky against New Hampshire, where the statement damn fuscous and then racketeer were held to be words which might insight to retaliation and the Court they unanimously affirmed the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.297" offset="8268570">The appellant cannot find any solace in any argument that the appellant was convicted of under a general of verdict that was perhaps for the words, for the act or for both.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.685" offset="8326144">It is obvious that he was arrested, tried, and convicted only for the act of burning the American flag, should Judge Fuld precipices the appeal of a unanimous court with the following, “We are called upon to determine whether the deliberate act of burning an American flag in public as a protest maybe punish as a crime."</text>
