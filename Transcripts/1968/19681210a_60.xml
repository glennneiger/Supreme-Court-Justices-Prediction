            <label>Mr. Marshall Patner</label>
            <text syncTime="37.426" offset="253053">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.879" offset="274892">This is a case where the failure to arrest hecklers resulted in suppression of free speech where demonstrators were peaceful and where the hecklers threatened and attacked them for there mere presence on the streets.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.945" offset="343124">Now, the defendant in between 65 and 70 or 80 other people in August of 1965, conducted a protest march and did so by beginning in Chicago's Lakefront at Buckingham Fountain then went to the City Hall, paraded there and then marched to the area in which the Mayor of the City of Chicago lives called Bridgeport, some five or eight miles from the loop, the downtown area.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.393" offset="476975">When they arrived, there were approximately 35 people in the neighborhood on the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.583" offset="517726">They marched silently in the evening but when they first arrived, they sang some songs, they chanted, made several kinds of remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.347" offset="568717">They were permitted from the time they started at Buckingham Fountain to City Hall, to the mayor's community to march and proceed with the same kinds of remarks, the same kinds of singing and chanting under the eyes of the local police and the accompaniment of a corporation counsel or a city attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.049" offset="655548">After they had marched for sometime in the Bridgeport community, at a request of a police commander on the scene, Dick Gregory who took charge of this march and this group, agreed with the request of the commander that after 8:20 p.m., there would be no singing and no chanting.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.283" offset="736528">And after that time, there was no conversation whatsoever by the marchers directed toward the spectators.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.174" offset="776025">The only sound whatsoever made except for walking was communication by Gregory to the people, telling them that he was marching with them, telling them to stay in line to obey the police suggestion of where they should march and they did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.433" offset="837151">They stayed on the public sidewalks, except when interrupted by local people who put hoses in their way.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.037" offset="867558">Those were removed at police direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.734" offset="878320">They did so and stop when one heckler stood in their way and the policeman asked him to get out of the way and he did so and then they proceeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.001" offset="919385">When a countermarch started in order not to join it, they changed direction for a block or so and then resume the same direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.446" offset="953135">Now, while they're conduct continued to be peaceful, the crowd began to gather and a crescendo grew in that crowd.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.522" offset="997439">Now the hecklers as we call them that the local people who came out were not in anyway captives of these peaceful marchers.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.150" offset="1035995">The marchers never made any noise as I said after 8:20.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.484" offset="1049266">They never sang or chanted but the people chose from -- to grow and to come out.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.391" offset="1068910">The group grew from 35 until ultimately there may have been 1200 or 1400.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.254" offset="1092420">The subject to this demonstration involved criticism of the then Superintendent of Schools of the City of Chicago, Benjamin Willis who often have been criticize for his policies and racial problems in the city schools, an issue of public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.448" offset="1181132">Now what is missing from the opinion below which affirm the jury conviction of disorderly conduct on two counts are the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.134" offset="1223868">There was no invective or invitation to violence by the peaceful marchers, sometimes called provocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.516" offset="1269426">There was no effort by the police to arrest any heckler.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.969" offset="1291264">All of the police in this case were awfully good in trying to protect the marchers.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.149" offset="1307982">They were very good at that and what's interesting about this case I think a bit unusual in these demonstration of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.279" offset="1344449">We have very little dispute with the facts stated by the Illinois Supreme Court, very little at all but we have a better difference with the city who seems to move up some of the chanting that occurred earlier, and so it appeared after 8:20.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.392" offset="1420936">It did not occur after 8:20.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.686" offset="1430131">The only other factual if I can get rid of that dispute we have in the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.549" offset="1445595">They say that there was a crack force there of task force that was special, that was specially trained to go out and deal with these kind of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.466" offset="1481226">They say so in their brief but at page 33 of the appendix -- that's referring to the page of the appendix, it's 103 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.263" offset="1516440">The policeman testified that they have no special training at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.120" offset="1531904">Except for that, this is not a case that involves any dispute in the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.441" offset="1549145">And the police here did a splendid job in attempting to protect the marchers as they went around the mayor's house.</text>

            <text syncTime="1234.708" offset="5042239">But if the police in this case, it's easier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.451" offset="5053210">Because here, they -- they didn't have anybody just saying something, they have people actually breaking police lines, being grabbed but being thrown back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.586" offset="5097723">Now, that's the difference here and if they had done that just as they did initially when this began, the first man who stepped in front of that line and blocked it was asked by the police to leave and when he was asked, he did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.058" offset="5155610">It -- we could assume that the people of Bridgeport if asked by the police, by the bullhorn would have left or as the city did the next year, if they'd arrested those violent people, not -- they say they couldn't find the stone throwers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.540" offset="5209527">Okay, they couldn't find them but if the people who broke the lines were taken into custody as an example because they themselves had done something.</text>

            <text syncTime="1290.460" offset="5265220">So what we have here is no invective or invitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.741" offset="5278386">No effort by the police to protect and the court below relies in this case, almost totally, and Mr. Justice Black's dissent in Fainer but out of context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.851" offset="5338781">It says, this -- the Illinois Supreme Court says, that there's an obligation to protect the speaker but the part they miss that comes both before and after that is where that dissent said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.868" offset="5402833">The obligation is to protect his right to speak and that is a dramatic difference, and the way to protect the right to speak is to arrest the hecklers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1388.756" offset="5658415">I was saying that the context of the shouting down means that the heckler decides.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.977" offset="5683284">But the problem -- the difference I would make is as in this case where those people not only are shouting but they are taking some physical act to interfere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.564" offset="5725602">The next question is really the hardest one I'm sure but I don't think we reached it yet in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.891" offset="5750888">If the speaker is shouted at in bad taste and without allowing him to have his First Amendment right to speak, we don't have that here because what we have here is a physical threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.393" offset="5808985">But it's ominous in those other cases that I've just mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.792" offset="5826539">And what happened is, the police decide that because the speech by its nature which is provoking, using provoking now in the other sense that is annoying causing dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.516" offset="5885471">As soon as that happens and people don't like it and they get violent, the more violent they get, the more right they have to suppress and terminate the speech and that's why we use the term that we think was aptly coined by Professor Kalven at the University of Chicago in his book, The Heckler's Veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.517" offset="5961435">And we think that the Heckler's Veto is what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.124" offset="5975855">Now, we think therefore that there's the -- what's lacking is the invective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.779" offset="5998529">What's lacking is the effort to arrest and disperse and what's lacking is the obligation to protect the right to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.143" offset="6023920">Now, we're not here simply to tear down something and to say again that this is a case in which an arrest in not adequate, the conviction is not adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.671" offset="6070105">I think that perhaps there are some obligations to suggest something positive and I think that in drawing a narrow ordinance as the court has asked for many times, it's possible to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.495" offset="6137396">Now, the city argues that the construction below is such a narrow construction and they say that you're bound as the Illinois Supreme Court read the ordinance to take it as though that's how it was written.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.440" offset="6189119">But in writing it that way and that's the last page of our certiorari petition where the appendix sets out the opinion at page 16 (a), 15 and 16 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.205" offset="6232168">What's missing there is anything, anything at all by the speakers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.337" offset="6260694">It's all imputed to them by the violence of other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.193" offset="6276159">Now, for an ordinance were written and I don't tend to be addressed with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.739" offset="6294340">I just put down some thoughts that said something like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.588" offset="6305729">A disorderly conduct is that doing of and act where the use of speech or other conduct which includes invective fighting words -- I'm trying to use some of the kinds of things that we've taken for some judicial meaning for, which includes invective or fighting words or gestures that are menacing or otherwise invite violence with the intent to cause public disorder then he can be guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.012" offset="6407398">But none of those elements are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.468" offset="6413249">What we have only are instead, -- not our, what we only have singly is when the policeman who has attempted to protect goes up and -- came quietly and politely and responsibly says leave because there's going to be violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.449" offset="6485138">If you don't listen to him under the Illinois Supreme Court's reading of the ordinance then you suddenly become guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.799" offset="6518575">He becomes the arbiter, and charge in the whole thing, even if he is acting a good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.004" offset="6543339">But he has made a mistake here in not trying to stop the violence against the demonstrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.645" offset="6573955">So I think that an ordinance can be drafted, I'm not suggesting that we're looking for some system that's chaos at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2188.281" offset="8856534">300 years ago in Cox versus Bernard, sir John Paul said, “Let us consider the reason of the case for nothing is law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2246.654" offset="9089964">The petitioners demand the mayor, fire the superintendent of schools, an action clearly beyond the jurisdiction of the mayor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.302" offset="9128626">The petitioners in speech and placard called the mayor a snake and petitioner Gregory threatened to march in the mayors' home everyday until he fire the Superintendent of Schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.926" offset="9187035">A hundred police protected 60 to 85 marchers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.323" offset="9204694">The march covered between five and five and a half hours through the evening rush hour and after darkness had fallen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.658" offset="9241997">A seasoned commander of police in the face of a sudden increase and the number of threatening hostile spectators, fearing that a riot would occur because the spectators had gathered at 35th in union -- 35th in Lowe and 36th in Union.</text>
