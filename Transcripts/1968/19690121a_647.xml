            <label>Mr. Charles Morgan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="29.126" offset="221874">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.352" offset="250817">We're back today in a matter of great gravity on the start of a new international life, even though it's not the beginning of another term of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.404" offset="315079">Theme of the next few years is to bring us together.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.389" offset="342977">We're confronted today with a question, amongst others, which directly relates to Section 148 of the Alabama Code in both its aspects, and a defendant, Judge of Probate from the State of Alabama named James Dennis Herndon.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.829" offset="432734">Both the United States and counsel for defendant Herndon agree that, for some reason, this case should be remanded to the District Court other than for a hearing on contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.398" offset="507026">It is this Court's order that was violated, if any, by defendant Herndon, not the order of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.494" offset="543389">This case is comparable to Ship only in the sense that this Court is much more clearly involved than this Court was involved in Ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.039" offset="609531">The gravity of the case in Ship, of course, involved a lynching in the loss of a human life.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.268" offset="638474">In this case, it involves what we consider the theft of the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.618" offset="671911">Regardless of the evidence in the case which quite clearly points, we believe the evidence had been compiled since we were last here, which quite clearly indicates that the defendant Herndon is in contempt of this Court's order, I would cite to you the first part of Section 148.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.400" offset="747039">We challenge the constitutionality of the second part of that statute which states, in effect, that the ballots shall not be printed until 20 days before the general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.285" offset="794582">The defendant Herndon received a copy of the dissolution of the order of the lower Court on the 14th.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.017" offset="829482">He had his ballots back by the 17th, the day on which he is required to have had, by name, removed from the ballot by Alabama law.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.246" offset="882354">And, in his haste to delete the names of the Negro candidates from the ballot, he not only violated the order of this Court, but violated the first provisions of Section 148.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.326" offset="986739">Since this last election, Alabama now has more elected Negro officials than in any other southern state, 72.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.083" offset="1029789">Additionally, one -- more official has been appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.905" offset="1053090">The 17 Negros elected in this election to admittedly minor posts by the NDPA, equals the entire number of Negro elected officials in the state of Florida, for instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.160" offset="1114112">There are now, in the south, or the best ascertainable techniques that we have, 384 Negro elected public officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.688" offset="1160192">There maybe up to 400, but those are the figures of the Southern Regional Council Voter Project.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.661" offset="1200107">During these four years, of course, we concern ourselves in the south, all of us no matter which side of the particular political fence we're on or otherwise, regarding the upcoming life that we're about to live.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.599" offset="1271787">For a number of years in the south, men have contumaciously violated the orders of the United States Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.992" offset="1313374">I've been involved in a case which involved a man standing in a door at a university.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.766" offset="1340437">We have witnessed riots in Mississippi at a university.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.278" offset="1374501">We've witnessed overtly contemptuous acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.684" offset="1384114">We've seen district judges pilloried and others too, and that's free speech but free speech, of course, stops when the Court order comes and you're ordered to abet.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.485" offset="1431343">And, the defendant Herndon in this case was faced with the greatest threat a man in GreeneCounty Public Office could be faced with, no doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.967" offset="1473243">Unlike Macon County, Alabama where you do have a more coalesced movement for true integration in politics.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.056" offset="1513681">In Greene County, the probate judge found himself suddenly faced with the imminent election of four Negros to the five-man County Commission and two Negros to the five-man County Board of Education, on which, one Negro then said “this is not a large county.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.851" offset="1588809">It's a small county.”</text>
            <text syncTime="372.955" offset="1597273">There are not a lot of folks there.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.658" offset="1608035">You think no one knew each other to read the depositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.300" offset="1622664">All the White politicians just get together every now and then.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.990" offset="1637397">There's an affidavit in the record now that says “Well, I've seen them play dominos almost every day, but they just sort of never even see each other.”</text>
            <text syncTime="391.656" offset="1672088">They all subscribed to newspapers, but nobody seems to read them except the defendant Herndon, and he did admit that.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.278" offset="1702494">They've all got television sets and they've got two television stations they receive clearly from Birmingham and one from Oridion, but the White public officials just didn't know anything about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.492" offset="1743350">But, they never campaigned for office this time.</text>

            <text syncTime="478.773" offset="2020561">Now, had the names been on the ballot, there were 1,938 straight ticket votes, and the highest White candidate got 1,709.</text>

            <text syncTime="548.748" offset="2300385">He says, first, that he'd read the newspapers, he saw the order was reinstated, knew something about it but he didn't know that it applied to the local candidates, that he didn't think he was covered by a Court order and that none was served on him personally, that he wasn't represented in these proceedings before, and that he wasn't a party-defendant to these proceedings before, that he didn't have actual or constructive knowledge of the order of this Court, that he did, as he says, read something about it but he just didn't understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.337" offset="2438729">Now, in Alabama, you don't have to be a lawyer to be a judge of probate, but it just happens that Judge Herndon is a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.610" offset="2467882">And, it just happens that Judge Herndon was also the Herndon in the case of Herndon versus Lee which was the last election case in Greene County and, in Greene County in 1966, the Fifth Circuit stayed the general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.384" offset="2530994">And, the sheriff there, whose name is Lee, is still in office not by virtue of election, but by virtue of the fact that the matter still been stayed and there's been no election.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.188" offset="2578223">And the situation we find ourselves in now is we're right back in the same place, where all of a sudden, one of the parties in Herndon versus Lee, the same James Dennis Herndon.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.395" offset="2623049">And, James Dennis -- on the printing of the ballot, by the way, on the Section that we're talking about 148, under Section 145, talking about the printing of the ballot, the case of Herndon versus Lee is cited there again for the proposition that, up to 20 days before the election, a man has a right to remove his name from the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.776" offset="2708522">I'm, of course, arguing from the -- from what I think is clear from the facts and circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1019.831" offset="4184754">Now, another sentence in Section 148, which we've attacked the constitutionality of, and that is the last sentence which says that a person cannot appear on the “more than one party” label or emblem on the ballot.</text>

            <text syncTime="1063.479" offset="4359356">Alabama used literacy tests, property qualifications, and we also had a Grandfather Clause of a type.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.017" offset="4381508">We called it Abiding Grandfather Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.705" offset="4392270">It fought many wars, it'd come along.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.602" offset="4403869">Just preceding that, in 1892 in Alabama, there was great political turmoil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.489" offset="4427379">Reuben F. Cobb was running on the Populous ticket.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.329" offset="4438768">Coalitions and infusion were taking place all across the south.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.893" offset="4452979">1894, you have the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.468" offset="4459248">Cobb lost by 11,000 votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.496" offset="4467399">1894, he lost by a greater margin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.964" offset="4477325">In 1896, you recalled that William Jennings Bryan was nominated by two political parties for President, by three really.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.716" offset="4500313">I think the Free Silver Republicans were with him also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.059" offset="4513688">And, at that time, there was a dispute over who would be Vice President.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.999" offset="4525390">The Democrats nominated Sewall, the Republic of the Populous nominated Tom Watson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.605" offset="4551826">The Fusion Movement in the south at that time, somewhat different from in New York and the rest of the country, the Fusion Movement offered an opportunity for him on our political party to attempt to reach out to bring Negro voters into its grasp.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.897" offset="4605012">And, in those elections in Alabama, there was competition for the Negro vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.108" offset="4625805">There was racism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.976" offset="4629358">It resulted in -- after the elections of 1896 in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.770" offset="4648479">It resulted in the terrified political problem to a number of urban southerners and a number of Populous because there were about 1,000 elected Negro officials in the State of North Carolina in the year 1896 and, in that context, the Populous Party went down to destruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.366" offset="4714935">Now, this political movement in this state, with Section 148 on the ballot, cannot accomplish Fusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.989" offset="4741371">They cannot win a democratic primary election, and the practical reason they can't win the primary election is because, by the state's own documents, approximately one-third of the voters in Alabama now are illiterate or semi-illiterate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.605" offset="4795810">And, if you walk into a polling place in the primary election, the ballots are arranged differently at each polling place by alphabet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.797" offset="4828620">So, consequently, you have to walk in and mark, and mark, and mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.070" offset="4845652">These same candidates here run once and lost then come back and win again when they could vote a straight ticket, and if you cannot combine, in Alabama, you're not going to be able for this -- to have this party move out in an integrated effort to bring forward the best candidates it can find from our political parties, as well as from its own.</text>

            <text syncTime="1263.448" offset="5159225">So, I reckon, we're talking about order of the 14th which was restored by the order of the 19th, and that at least gets us the one order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.104" offset="5193812">In the -- people -- Section 148's last phrase, which we do have under attack here, which we have under attack as a declaratory judgment, and I think it's very important to think in terms of Williams v. Rhodes and the problems of the administration of the law as far as the future is concerned so that there don't have to be later election cases brought on the eves of elections, so that matters can be adjudicated long enough in advance so that people will know what they're doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.659" offset="5304048">But, I'll just point out to you that, in 1960, we've heard a great deal of talk -- we heard a great deal of talk in this election about the Electoral pillage but 1960, had it not been for the liberal party in line in New York, John Kennedy would not have carried New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.509" offset="5371444">And, had John Kennedy not carried New York, the 15 electoral votes that went to Harry Burke, 6 from Alabama, 8 from Mississippi, and 1 from a defaulting Republican elector in Oklahoma would've been sufficient then to have thrown the election into the House, and then, to have thrown also into the electoral college preceding that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.464" offset="5463291">There's no reason for the restriction that I can find, for the Anti-Fusion Movement other than to restrict the actions of third-parties in the same manner that was condemned in Williams versus Rhodes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.399" offset="5515013">The party cannot place the names of other nominees on the ballot, and it finds itself in deep difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.461" offset="5539255">In this case, of course, we find that with respect to the electoral vote and, incidentally, it's quite important with respect to that vote for the matters to be adjudicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.909" offset="5589096">We have some very real problems here with respect to the primary law in the State of Alabama which allows you to have a primary if you have a 20% vote in any county.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.174" offset="5638102">In this last election, the NDPA got more than 20% of the votes for office countywide in 12 counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.571" offset="5687735">The combined vote of electors, AIDP and NDPA electors, would have allowed an additional 12 counties to allow us to come into the primary law and have this own party -- to have its own primaries in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.876" offset="5768923">In short, it covers the rest of my time and simply say that we feel that the vindication of this Court's order requires the defendant we required to show cause why he should not be held in civil or criminal contempt.</text>

            <text syncTime="1443.416" offset="5879056">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.659" offset="5896088">First, a word about the matter of contempt, we don't wish to take any absolute position with respect to that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.521" offset="5951467">It seemed to us that the order of this Court, merely restoring a detailed order of the District Court, and the violation of the terms of that order of the District Court might be viewed as well as contempt of the District Court's order as contempt of this Court's order, perhaps in both, if in both or if only at the District Court's order, it would seem to us appropriate for that matter to be explored more fully in the District Court since there are admittedly disputed questions of fact to be explored.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.671" offset="6096081">On the one end, Judge Herndon, as we understand it, was served sometime back with a copy of the order of the District Court in September 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.515" offset="6143519">It was, therefore, presumably fully aware of its terms and how it applied to him and the candidates that he is carrying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.174" offset="6174135">If he received notice that that very order, which he'd already seen and studied and presumably he was ready to effectuate, had been restored by order of this Court, he needed no further notice in order to act on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.900" offset="6233067">It does appear, however, that he received no formal communication of the action of this Court either from a clerk of this Court or from the attorneys representing Alabama before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.001" offset="6293462">Why he received no notice from the Attorney General's Office of Alabama is perhaps one of the matters that deserve exploration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.100" offset="6337870">He did admittedly read some accounts of this Court's action in the newspapers, but we're not clear whether that came home to him or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.739" offset="6376427">Under those circumstances, it seems to us that the matter is not yet ready for adjudication, that the District Court is obviously a more convenient forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.770" offset="6420522">That jurisdictionally, since it was the order of that Court, however affected by a subsequent order here, it was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.826" offset="6456675">That Court would have jurisdiction to explore the matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2080.638" offset="8427980">As we see this case, it does involve a serious abridgment of the rights of Negro citizens in Alabama to fully participate in the political process.</text>

            <text syncTime="2126.463" offset="8611255">Even though in light of history, both ancient history and recent history, it's difficult to indulge in that assumption, but what is at stake here are at least three rights: the right of persons to associate together for political purposes to form an effective party, in this case, something of a splinter-party from the Democratic Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.282" offset="8714595">There is also the right of the candidates themselves, specific candidates involved here, to run for political office to have votes casted on that is to be on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.320" offset="8762661">And, finally and perhaps most important, are the rights of a group of citizens here, as it happens, a majority of the citizens in these counties, to vote for, to select, to cast their votes for the candidate of their choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.486" offset="8835385">If they're not permitted to that as in Greene County, if they only have one slate, they're affectively disfranchised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.635" offset="8867986">You don't want to vote for these candidates, their own candidates are taken off the ballot, and their folks for all offices are defeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.866" offset="8912917">Now, that was done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.415" offset="8931098">There was 67 candidates being with, that is, local candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.900" offset="8949070">I'm only speaking of the local candidates because candidates for Presidential elector, for national office and for statewide office were defeated by any combination of statistics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.137" offset="9001942">Therefore, it seems to us is a practical matter, perhaps the legal matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.442" offset="9015212">The case is live only with respect to the local candidates, and then only with respect to those 23 of them who prevailed or would have prevailed, 23 out of 67, approximately a-third prevailed or would have prevailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.566" offset="9083653">17 of those were, in fact, elected in three counties: Marengo, Etowah, and Sumter Counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.946" offset="9113224">They were elected, however, at the very minor posts: Justice of the Peace, Constable, in one case Chairman of the Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.221" offset="9146347">There was more, it's taking Greene County, four seats on the five-man Board of Commissioners which governs the county were up for election, and they were NDPA candidates for each of those four posts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.450" offset="9203190">The statistics make it perfectly clear they would have prevailed had they been on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.579" offset="9227745">And, also, there were two seats on the five-man Board of Education and Mr. Morgan pointed out, the local head of this party was already sitting on the Board of Education, and there were now two more seats up and, again, the Negro candidates from all that appears would have prevailed for those seats.</text>

            <text syncTime="2407.570" offset="9735670">Apparently, it was thought appropriate to invoke it in Greene County.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.817" offset="9760643">The net result, in any event, is that a majority of the voters in these four counties were denied an opportunity, if the judgment of the District Court prevails, to cast their vote for the candidate of their choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.577" offset="9843712">Now, the provision most immediately involved is Section 274 of the Corrupt Practices Act, subsections in the Alabama Code which was a part of the Corrupt Practices Act, which provides that within five days after he designates himself to run for elective office, he must file a designation of his finance committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.440" offset="9963144">In fact, failure to that timely, it is alleged, is the reason why these candidates were kept off the ballot in Greene County and should've been kept off the ballot, according to the state, elsewhere, though the judges of probate in those other counties didn't seem inclined to invoke this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.721" offset="10052274">It's not a very critical provision of the election laws, at least with respect to local office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.722" offset="10080277">If you look at some of the appendices we've filed, you'll see that these candidates spent something approaching $150.00 in the primary and general election campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.238" offset="10126357">The question of having a finance committee, a treasurer, or disbursement of expenses, tallying of contributions is not critical, it seems to us, with respect to that kind of office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.803" offset="10196679">Notice it appears that Alabama took this requirement very seriously.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.122" offset="10213919">As I just said, in some counties it appears to have been waived all together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.586" offset="10235758">It doesn't appear, as Judge Johnson pointed out, that the state officials themselves ever invoked these provisions to respond to him, nor is it easy to see why it would matter, assuming there's no corrupt purpose, but simply an oversight why it would matter if this designation were filed a few days late if it had been brought to the attention of the candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.536" offset="10343591">What's more, the provision isn't very clear on its face.</text>

            <text syncTime="2622.060" offset="10593635">The Alabama statute, which is reprinted in our brief, at page 3 (a) I believe, is unclear whether more than one such designation is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.725" offset="10644313">It merely reads as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.429" offset="10651105">Within five days of the announcement of his candidacy for any office, each candidate, this is for a state office, shall file with the Secretary of Sate and each candidate for a county office shall file with the judge of probate, and each candidate for a circuit and so forth, a statement showing the name of not less than one and no more than five persons elected to receive and expend all of it, and so forth, moneys received.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.610" offset="10755908">Nothing whatever about doing it again after the primary seems to be clear, as a matter of Alabama law, if this applies to primaries, no suggestion that it must be done twice and, indeed, implication in this record is that it need not be done twice, at least when you're successful in the primary, nor does this requirement say that you must announce the party with which you're affiliated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.492" offset="10859353">That's part of the Garret Act and, as to the Garret Act, we say that it was not properly cleared under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and therefore, cannot be made applicable to the selection.</text>

            <text syncTime="2727.838" offset="11016819">It was there held that the Negro candidate for Sheriff, Gilmore, could not be placed on the ballot because he had filed his designation within five days after he had accepted the nomination of the Freedom Party, rather than five days after the party had certified his nomination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.636" offset="11112009">That's inconsistent with the way in which it was applied to the White candidates here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.444" offset="11135206">The Democratic Party certified these White candidates and nothing further was filed by the candidates.</text>

            <text syncTime="2774.686" offset="11204169">Finally, it seems to us that in this case, and generally but specially in this case, this requirement of Alabama law was employed unfairly because no opportunity was afforded to these candidates to correct what is, in the circumstances, a mere technical defect and that depriving them of a place in the ballot and depriving their constituents of a vote is to make too much turning on to the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2816.223" offset="11370308">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.225" offset="11394341">The argument that I have proposed to make for the appellees I represent here does not cover the contempt question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.621" offset="11431852">Judge Herndon is separately represented on that so I won't be touching on that, and I feel a little at a disadvantage on a part of the response for the reason that I consider the counsel for the appellants, insofar as he did refer to the merits of this case, referred only and then only briefly to an attack on Title 17 Section 148 or the last sentence thereof and did not make reference, as I see is argument, to the other matters that are raised in brief and that were raised in the submission that the parties had attending itself to the merits here the last time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.973" offset="11597364">I do consider, however, that the Solicitor General in his argument explored most of these avenues and I want to direct myself, if I may, to his merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.846" offset="11644803">I think that there's a little misconception as to the facts and I would like to ask for the Court to bear with me just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.615" offset="11687852">To go back to the beginning of this entire picture or facture, the Solicitor General makes a point, for example, in brief that this case has now been mooted as to the rights of all persons except one, those in Greene County, who were not on the ballot and who the argument proceeds were due to and placed on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.339" offset="11790775">And then, those in three other counties: Etowah, Marengo, and Sumter Counties who were victorious, some of whom were opposed for these officers, some of whom were not opposed, some of whom were the only persons on the ballot because the status of their election is affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.743" offset="11864440">Certainly, we agree with that, but we don't intend to let the picture be confused for this reason, that we consider the third point that the Solicitor General mentions in brief to be the most important part -- point as far as the State of Alabama is concerned, and that is a validity of these statutes, the validity of the Corrupt Practices Act, the validity of the Garret Act, the validity of the other statutes under attack, the question of whether the Garret Act is due to be subjected to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, prior to its efficacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.852" offset="12012816">Those are the questions in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.272" offset="12018458">Those are the questions that gave rise to the case, and that's what we came here on the first time and, as far as the State of Alabama is concerned, we are still here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.006" offset="12057433">Now, this is not to demean or belittle the fact that this Court probably has to decide the fate of particular people, that it has to decide, for example, whether there will be perhaps an election in Greene County or not, a new election, maybe it has to decide that, it's asked to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.913" offset="12145100">It has to decide then perhaps whether certain persons who were elected under the NDPA ballot in these three other counties are due to continue holding their office, but I think it has to decide this because it has to decide the validity of the statutes and then their application to these particular persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.061" offset="12237678">And, I make this point only to say this, that the Solicitor General is in error, and I think completely unwillingly, when he says that the Negro candidates, as he says, the NDPA candidates, because they were not all Negro, there were some White and some Negro, but the candidates of the National Democratic Party of Alabama, he said, filed a declaration of intent and a designation of committee on March -- on or before March 1, 1968 and that -- then, he says the White candidates, I have presumed by that he means the candidates of the regular Democratic Party of Alabama for nomination in this primary, filed such a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.189" offset="12398174">And then, he said, that the law is so unequally applied, or at least I understand him to say this, that the law is so unequally applied in Alabama that such a filing was held to be good for all time as far as what he called the White candidates were concerned and not good so far as what he called the Negro candidates.</text>

            <text syncTime="3107.662" offset="12536101">The District Court found that the statutes under attack, one, were not unconstitutional on their face, two, were not shown to have been unconstitutionally applied and, three, the holding was that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was not involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.487" offset="12603392">Now, this, as I understand it, is the decree that was appealed from.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.468" offset="12619274">It said one other thing in the decree, and that is that it was not then going into the details.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.398" offset="12646964">We were dealing with 123 people, to start with, not the 67 the counsel speaks of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.662" offset="12672042">We were dealing with 123 people and it said, since we have made these rules, then what we are concerned with is a question of state law and we're not going into the detail of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.154" offset="12726063">It can be handled in the customary fashion, so that it didn't make that examination, but the point is that the record in this case will reflect that counsel's statement was wrong with reference to the 67, approximately, of the NDPA candidates who survived the original agreement that they weren't qualified, and this was done by letters of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.047" offset="12829612">The Court is familiar with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.980" offset="12833374">It's in the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.598" offset="12839852">This was done by letters of counsel, back and forth, written at the order of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.220" offset="12858347">It certainly is true that some NDPA candidates filed declarations of intent prior to March 1, and that they filed on the same form that was used by other candidates and that that declaration of intent contained a designation of committee, and designated themselves, as counsel points out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.799" offset="12940581">Now, some did and some did not with reference to the six people in Greene County who were left off the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.419" offset="12983108">My understanding is, and I believe that these are the facts, that all six of those individuals had qualified as candidates in the democratic primary of the regular Democratic Party of Alabama which was held on May 7, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.182" offset="13050190">That, in that primary, there were two candidates for each of the position, one, the NDPA candidate, these six, the other, the candidate of the regular Democratic Party of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.951" offset="13109227">So, it was a two-man race, as I understand it, in each one of these.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.558" offset="13119676">They filed identical papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.927" offset="13125110">There's no question about that, as far as I know, and they were placed on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.110" offset="13145903">They were held to be qualified to be on the ballot in the democratic primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.275" offset="13158546">Now, each of these six was defeated in the democratic primary and, though I'm not trying the contempt case, I do point out, as we noted in brief, that this is an unrestricted primary, that everyone is allowed to vote in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.808" offset="13228659">It's not a close primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.599" offset="13235764">Counsel in his brief called Alabama a no-party state when it comes to holding its primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.678" offset="13260110">So, I don't make any brief for the fact of who would've won in November had both parties been on the ballot and campaigning against each other, but, in May, that was the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.804" offset="13300652">Now, counsel makes a point and I think this is a substantial question.</text>

            <text syncTime="3317.296" offset="13374631">I think it raises a substantial question because we were not confronted with the particulars, as I've read before, but let me illuminate it just a little bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.153" offset="13410053">They did file those papers, identifying themselves, and the law allows it to be done in this fashion, as a candidate of or candidate seeking the nomination of the Democratic Party for a particular position in the primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.337" offset="13470762">Now, what they are maintaining is this, that on the same day that that election, that primary election, was held, that the National Democratic Party of Alabama in that county also conducted a mass meeting on the same day because this isn't that at which political parties can nominate in Alabama, that they conducted a mass meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.695" offset="13556234">And, I will be frank to admit that I've learned, in this case, I suppose that a mass meeting can be two or more, but that's not a part of the issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.321" offset="13586745">That issue was resolved unfavorably to the position of the appellees in the District Court in the only point on which decision was made on, and we're not raising it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.270" offset="13622481">But, they represent that, on that same day, they were nominated by the National Democratic Party of Alabama for the same offices in a mass meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.569" offset="13667725">And, what is said now to the Court is that the declarations of intent and the designation of committee that they made for the handling of their finances for this primary in which they were eliminated and which, for all that appears, they were no longer a candidate because nobody knew of the candidacy of these people, these candidates and most of the other candidates of this party, until about September 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.183" offset="13774200">And, I think the Court will recall that the record shows very clearly that the certifications of nomination descended from Huntsville, Alabama simultaneously by registered or certified mail on the various probate officers in the 67 counties of Alabama and in the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.623" offset="13847865">Now, I don't know, when I say to the Court I think it has not been ruled on Alabama, whether a designation of committee under the Corrupt Practices Act made in a situation in which a party -- an individual does identify himself as a participant in the primary election process of one party is an adequate compliance with the Corrupt Practices Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.701" offset="13960192">When he turns up later to be, and when he loses that race, and turns up later to be the candidate of another party that nominated on a different fashion, purportedly on the same day, where his candidacy itself was not known for a couple of months later because it was not declared, I don't know the answer to that.</text>

            <text syncTime="4081.825" offset="16432734">But, we make the point again that, of course, we have come down now because of the fact that the election has been held, we've come down to the point where -- are those who remain, the winners and those who were left off the ballot, we would say that perhaps some did and some did not execute these doctrines.</text>

            <text syncTime="4442.993" offset="17877410">Now, also, the law allows that candidates may be nominated by conventions where the delegates to the convention also were chose in these caucus held on May 7.</text>

            <text syncTime="4490.181" offset="18066119">It does say that the report of the nominations must be signed by the chairman, I believe, presiding at the meeting and the secretary of the meeting, which was not done in the great many of these cases, but no one undertook to disqualify anybody for failure to do that, so that, the primary election law is the most stringent.</text>

            <text syncTime="4512.619" offset="18155875">Now, it has long been the law in Alabama that a person seeking to run in the primary election must file his declaration of intent by March 1 of that election year.</text>

            <text syncTime="4528.464" offset="18219301">A political party eligible to hold a primary, but desiring not to hold one, and to nominate back in convention or caucus or mass meeting must make known by approximately March 1, and this has long been the law that it decides not to hold a primary election and it can go to other route to request nomination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4550.199" offset="18306236">The sole effect of the Garret Act was to say to the person who seeks nomination by the party holding the caucus or mass meeting or who seeks to get on the ballot as an independent that, by March 1, the same date on which the great majority of other candidates who are running in the primaries, the same date on which they must make their declaration you must file a declaration of intent to become a candidate.</text>

            <text syncTime="4670.457" offset="18787203">Of course, this Court has, I assume, under consideration at this time the three Mississippi cases, and I'm not aware of any decision that has come out on that yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="4680.296" offset="18826595">I think that out of the three, for example, If I can extent just a moment comparing them with our case, and I may get the name mixed up with the facts but, in one of these cases, as I recall, the Mississippi law was changed to make an elective office an appointive office, Office of the Superintendent of Education in 11 counties in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="4703.528" offset="18919487">This, I can equate on the facts with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4706.344" offset="18930772">And, another election was changed from a district election of Board of County Commissioners or some similar office to an at large election.</text>
            <text syncTime="4716.932" offset="18973194">But, in one case, and this is the Whitley against Williams, you had a statute which apparently did four things.</text>
            <text syncTime="4727.945" offset="19017185">One of which -- only one of which is what the Garret Act does.</text>
            <text syncTime="4733.591" offset="19039754">The statute fairly established to the rule that no person who had voted in the primary election could run as an independent candidate in the general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="4740.062" offset="19065668">Well, this, of course, is not part of Alabama law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4743.852" offset="19080819">They require independent candidates to qualify to run in the general election as the same time as candidates must qualify to run in the primary election.</text>
            <text syncTime="4751.568" offset="19111643">Now, this is what the Garret Act almost does, but not quite.</text>
            <text syncTime="4757.647" offset="19135990">The Garret Act requires that he declare his intent to be a candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4764.406" offset="19163052">Now, whatever acts of qualification or selection by petition may be involved, it does not require him to do that at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4775.305" offset="19206625">There, it most applied by tallying the number of signatures of qualified electors and then it had some verification requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4786.193" offset="19250197">I think that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is Fifteenth Amendment-oriented throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="4793.398" offset="19279036">I think that just about every section of the Act, with a possible exception of Section 1973 (c), makes specific reference to the Fifteenth Amendment and the protection of Fifteenth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4809.942" offset="19345178">And, of course, that section is applied only in locals where it has been found that those rights have been violated and that there has been a finding through the process they had established that there's going to be -- that there will be examiners and that the other things will take place provided for there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4828.980" offset="19421351">Now, I say in that context that you can't find or justify finding that the Garret Act which does only one thing, and that is it gives everybody who desires to be a candidate for an office the same starting time to do only one thing that is not to become the nominee, but it is to declare his intent to become a candidate and to freeze in place, in effect, then that for at least that election period.</text>
            <text syncTime="4865.332" offset="19566696">But, it creates or systematizes law that has existed for a long time, and it's not a Black versus White proposition.</text>

            <label>Mr. L. Drew Redden</label>
            <text syncTime="5906.845" offset="23732809">I talked to Mr. Bookawt, the Deputy Attorney General who, I believe, on two occasions and he did some checking apparently with the -- come to know with the Office of the Secretary of State, and the message came back that -- either to this effect that all knew or all had been advised but I've come to learn that the basis of this probably was that the Secretary of State advised that the only message that she had sent to the various probate judges, which would be all 67 probate judges not just a few involved with local offices, was the message that pursuant to the decree of the District Court the following persons would be certified, and that she had not ever rescinded that messages though there was a period of time within which it -- a brief period of time, within which it could've been rescinded and I believe she testified, as a matter of fact, that she was working on a rescission message at the time she learned of the order here, which I believe she says she recalls learning in all probability from the Attorney General's Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="5984.933" offset="24045129">So that, what had been sent to them, the only message that had been sent to them from the Office of the Secretary of State was a message that, pursuant to the order of the District Court, that the following names would be certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="6000.708" offset="24108241">Of course, they had received a similar or -- well, I say, they were -- had received a copy of the order of the District Court which named all of the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="6011.315" offset="24150664">I assume that the message from the Secretary of State did not name any about the statewide candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="6019.755" offset="24184414">The only other pieced of information I have with reference to notification of us, and I didn't know this at the time, but Mr. Bookawt testified when his deposition was taken that he learned of the fact that the order had been entered by this Court on Saturday afternoon, October 19, which would have been the date that it was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="6041.571" offset="24271663">He was called at his home by the clerk or a deputy clerk in Montgomery and was given that message directly and was asked to write it down which, I believe, he testified he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="6054.442" offset="24323176">This order was entered approximately either 16 or 15 days prior to the date of the election, depending on how you would count it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6064.496" offset="24363405">Under the arrangement, there is a division of time with Judge Herndon's counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="6068.802" offset="24380646">I would like to make just a couple of other points, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="6074.021" offset="24401544">One is this, the Solicitor General said that he consider that, on the merits, there has been a serious abridgment of the right to participate in a political process and he relates three areas in which he says this abridgment result.</text>
            <text syncTime="6088.824" offset="24460685">One is the right of association, the other, right of candidates to run for office and, the third, the right for citizens to vote for the candidates of their choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="6098.489" offset="24499346">Maybe I had reiterated too often, but our position, again, from the position of the State of Alabama, we are not concerned with individual positions or individual candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="6113.661" offset="24560055">We are concerned with a validity of the statutes under attack and also, of course, with maintaining that, as to the facts of this case, that they were not unconstitutionally applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="6124.653" offset="24604045">Now, those two determinations were made by the District Court, and we say that they are due on this record and on the facts to be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="6133.819" offset="24640721">We maintain that this case can't be viewed solely on the basis of whatever history of discrimination there might have been in Alabama or in any other state in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="6146.591" offset="24691816">We acknowledge that, through decisions of this Court, decisions in other places, the state has stood convicted of particular Acts that the Court has found to be discriminatory on other occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6158.869" offset="24740927">We don't maintain to this Court that that's not true, but we do maintain that to give those an overwhelming importance here when we have to view legislation in the context of when it came into being, what its purposes are and, finally, how little burden it imposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6181.150" offset="24830056">And, I think that's one thing that, of course, appellants deemphasize and they tend to argue that this creates a tremendous burden on one seeking to run for public office.</text>
            <text syncTime="6194.610" offset="24883869">We think that the statutes, the ballot itself, in Alabama, demonstrate how easy it is to be a candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6202.982" offset="24917305">The District Court, again, and this point has been brought up earlier today, made the findings I have resided in favor of appellees and then it said that it would not determine the issues of state law that were involved, having made those findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="6218.901" offset="24981044">Of course, as this Court has pointed out today during this argument, it had the authority to.</text>
            <text syncTime="6224.360" offset="25002883">It was not a matter of its saying that we have no authority to decide this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6228.794" offset="25020646">It determined that it would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="6231.392" offset="25030990">Now, we say to this Court that that order or judgment is due to be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="6237.370" offset="25054919">The judgment appealed from is due to be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6241.123" offset="25069861">At the same time, it would not be improper in our judgment that that Court, that is the District Court, make those determinations of state law or that it be directed through a remand from this Court to make those determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6256.082" offset="25129733">But, as a preliminary event, there has to be a determination on the validity of the statutes and on their application in the facts and circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6266.853" offset="25172783">State of Alabama is not here arguing to set aside the election of any particular individual who was elected or to say that if there was someone kept off the ballot in Greene County who was due to be put on, that there shouldn't be a new election.</text>
            <text syncTime="6282.595" offset="25235790">This is not our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="6285.428" offset="25247180">Our positions is, the statutes are valid, that the record doesn't support any conclusion but that they were validly enforced and applied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6294.025" offset="25281557">And then, there is a matter of detail as to the question of whether a particular person satisfied the statute, whether a particular person's election is due to be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="6304.453" offset="25323248">To this point then, we finally agree with the Solicitor General that it has become moot as to everybody but these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="6312.890" offset="25356999">But, the important question still has to be resolved and would have to be resolved as long as one of them remained, and that's the validity of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6319.509" offset="25383434">That's what we're interested in, and we think that the mechanics of the thing might well be after that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6325.985" offset="25409348">That this Court would direct if the District Court ascertained what should be the result in the application of these valid statutes to the particular persons whose fate yet remains unsettled.</text>
            <text syncTime="6339.575" offset="25463683">I reserve the remaining time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6341.558" offset="25471624">Mr. Hubbard, thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Perry Hubbard</label>
            <text syncTime="6352.482" offset="25515301">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6355.177" offset="25526168">I am here in behalf of the defendant in a petition for rule to show cause, James Dennis Herndon.</text>
            <text syncTime="6365.918" offset="25569113">I will direct my remarks only to the issues as involved him.</text>
            <text syncTime="6372.475" offset="25595340">The question presently presented to this Court is on motion of the appellants for a rule to show cause why Judge Herndon should not be a judge in contempt of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6388.364" offset="25658870">As has been previously pointed out, this inquiry is, in part, a factual inquiry and is, in some respect, a question of law or procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="6406.203" offset="25730236">I consider it, at this time, premature in the absence of a full investigation of the facts to undertake to argue to this Court the facts of the alleged contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="6423.381" offset="25798990">I would like to point out only this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6427.271" offset="25814455">That, in the democratic primary in May of 1968, Judge Herndon, by virtue of the duties of his office, was required to have the ballot printed for this election.</text>
            <text syncTime="6443.664" offset="25880074">In that election, the NDPA candidates ran and also the candidates who were ultimately the nominees of the regular democratic parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="6457.007" offset="25933469">These were the only two candidates running in these -- in the democratic primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="6463.063" offset="25957710">And, at this time, there was no pending suit, no judicial compulsion, no coercion, no commotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6474.531" offset="26003581">Nevertheless, without any question, without any problem, these names were all placed on the ballot by Judge Herndon.</text>
            <text syncTime="6482.420" offset="26035137">The race was run without event.</text>
            <text syncTime="6485.001" offset="26045377">The county officials asked and obtained election observers and, to assure the proper conduct of the election, this was done and the election was held with -- uneventfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="6503.260" offset="26118416">Subsequently, in September, a certificate of mass meeting as to the nomination by mass meeting, these NDPA candidates, was filed with Judge Herndon.</text>
            <text syncTime="6519.294" offset="26182572">No additional qualification or designation out of the Corrupt Practices Act was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6526.812" offset="26212665">However, a suit was filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District.</text>
            <text syncTime="6532.191" offset="26234190">That Court entered an order, a copy of which was served upon Judge Herndon, directing that he include the NDPA candidates on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="6543.615" offset="26279852">During the pendency of this order, a temporary restraining order by the US District Court for the Middle District, it became necessary by virtue of time limits to print the absentee ballot which is required to be available substantially in advance of the time that the regular ballot is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="6564.968" offset="26365325">And, with the -- for the absentee ballot for this election, where he had in his hand and was aware of the order of the District Court, was printed so as to include the NDPA candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="6580.361" offset="26426870">It was only after he was served with -- by the clerk of the US District Court with a copy of its order dissolving the temporary restraining order, that the ballot for the general election was printed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6596.514" offset="26491444">Now, Mr. Morgan has suggested that this printing was unusual.</text>

            <label>Mr. Perry Hubbard</label>
            <text syncTime="6608.545" offset="26539614">It was actually ordered by him on the 14th.</text>
            <text syncTime="6610.986" offset="26549332">It was apparently delivered on about the 17th.</text>
            <text syncTime="6615.846" offset="26568767">And, Mr. Morgan has suggested that this was an unusually early printing of the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="6623.012" offset="26597501">Actually, I think that an investigation of the fact will demonstrate that this was one of the last ballots to be printed, that the printer had been insisting on our going ahead and finalizing the order and that it was done when this order -- the dissolution of the temporary restraining order was made or received by him.</text>
            <text syncTime="6643.724" offset="26680362">Now, it is not controverted in this case that, subsequent to that time, there was no delivery of any order.</text>
            <text syncTime="6651.290" offset="26710559">This is not the problem, nor do we convert -- controvert that if he had actual knowledge of the order that he would be equally in contempt of it as if one had been served on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="6663.168" offset="26758102">This is not the problem at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="6665.315" offset="26766670">Judge Herndon has by his response to the rule to show cause or the motion for rule to show cause, as asserted, that he was absolutely without knowledge of the applicability of the restoration of this temporary restraining order in its effect as to him and to local candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="6686.592" offset="26851830">And, this is the factual question that will be presented.</text>

            <text syncTime="7225.145" offset="29005991">Well, do you think we should leave to the District Court the question in the first instance of determining whose order was violated, if any order was violated?</text>

            <text syncTime="7235.634" offset="29047996">No, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="7236.190" offset="29050190">I believe that it would be entirely correct for this Court to direct that the legal effect of what was accomplished was to revitalize the order of the District Court just as it would have had an appeal that had been taken in a supersedious file to preserve intact the order of the lower Court and that this, indeed, is the order that is involve and remanded to the District Court for a determination and in accordance with the indications of the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="7275.594" offset="29207761">The question of whose order it is, is frankly without precedence.</text>
            <text syncTime="7278.843" offset="29220822">I have been unable to find any case that says -- that is sufficiently comparable to be authority one way or the other in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7291.465" offset="29271291">The Merrimack case, obviously, holds that one Act may be a contempt of the orders of both Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="7301.749" offset="29312460">This, however, is, I believe, a different type of Act from that which is involved in Ship, and Ship is substantially the only precedent for contempts in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7317.334" offset="29374736">The effect there was -- of the Act complained of was to completely defeat the jurisdiction of this Court so as to render ineffective any judgment that it might render.</text>
            <text syncTime="7331.061" offset="29429697">Here, obviously, this Court has the power to completely adjudicate this matter and give effect to its order.</text>
            <text syncTime="7340.853" offset="29468881">So, this is not the type of Act which would frustrate the jurisdiction of this Court to adjudicate the controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="7349.928" offset="29505139">Now, there is a second consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="7353.561" offset="29519663">The United States District Court has, indeed, assumed jurisdiction on the motion of the United States and has, since the action has been pending in this Court, issued an order enjoining the effectuation of the election and has preserved the status quo as it exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="7375.734" offset="29608375">During the pendency of this appeal, a number of depositions have already been taking there, that Court views that it still has and is exercising jurisdiction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7387.295" offset="29654559">Finally, I would cite to the Court the expressions of Mr. Justice Black in the Barnet case, in which he comments upon the respective functions of Trial and of Appellate Courts and points out, in some instances, the impracticality of undertaking a factual investigation in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7412.496" offset="29755392">Particularly, is this true in view of the obvious necessity that if a hearing is conducted here, it must be conducted by and before a commissioner, not as a proceeding for this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7427.092" offset="29813802">And, if the federal rules which give credence and presumptions favorable to the findings of trial judges taken on evidence taken orally before them has a basis, then the trying of a case before the judges on oral testimony is more apt to result on a correct result than would perhaps be accomplished by a hearing before a commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="7453.084" offset="29917769">There are other arguments that could be advanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="7457.272" offset="29934488">However, by way of summary, let me say that, insofar as the factual issue is concerned, it is our sincere position that Judge Herndon's ignorance of the order of this Court is merely an unfortunate breakdown in communications and that he failed genuinely to receive notice or knowledge of that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="7484.724" offset="30044306">The history of the man, I believe, showed that had he had notice of it, that he indeed would have complied with it.</text>

            <text syncTime="7949.965" offset="31905270">Surely, it's not improper because they've learned from history in Alabama the election in Macon County, where Sheriff Lucius Amerson ran.</text>

            <text syncTime="8404.792" offset="33724541">I think we've got something in this record that might show us we're in that same sort of position.</text>

            <text syncTime="8428.146" offset="33817955">It's a declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="8430.657" offset="33828091">We need to decide these matters now, rather than in a later time.</text>
            <text syncTime="8434.798" offset="33844600">And, the District Court opinion, of course, does uphold and did rule on the constitutionality of Section 125 and 148 of the Alabama Code, as well as the Garret law and the Corrupt Practices Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="8446.880" offset="33892979">The relief, a question was asked about that and I just want to urge that the relief be as specific as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="8456.928" offset="33933103">But you know, we're talking about -- when we talk about primary elections in Greene County, just remember we're talking about by either one of the two figures we've got, 127% or 124% of the White population of the county is registered to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="8471.694" offset="33992244">Now, we know that's not right but -- that can't be, but there are a lot of names there that don't live there.</text>
            <text syncTime="8479.873" offset="34024950">Accuse anybody with respect to that, but I just say that they're there and that's one of the criteria the Attorney General uses in sending examiners in and observers into a county is, have they purged the rules?</text>
            <text syncTime="8491.424" offset="34071134">Second, primary elections are run by the local Democratic Party folks, always.</text>
            <text syncTime="8497.841" offset="34096734">And, in those elections, there's always an alternate ballot position and, in this case, the only relief we have so far, and I believe after the three Mississippi cases were argued here and since there's such concern about setting aside elections, that the temporary relief of this Court could quite possibly have been utilized to force all the setting aside of any elections and, in that way, not go back and disturb anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="8527.186" offset="34214181">But, in this case, the only relief that we have now is that the incumbents are in office and hold over under Alabama law, and the sheriff's been holding over since 1966.</text>
