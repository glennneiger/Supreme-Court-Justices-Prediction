            <text syncTime="25.574" offset="102296">This is an appeal from an order of the three-judge court in the Central District in California declaring the California Criminal Syndicalism Act unconstitutional on its face and then all of its parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.896" offset="155481">In enjoining the District Attorney of Los Angeles County from enforcing and continuing the prosecution of a man named John Harris, Jr. who was one of the plaintiffs in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.568" offset="206263">The appeal is brought to District Attorney and represented here by the Attorney General of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.763" offset="231027">The complaint in the District Court was filed by John Harris, Jr. following his indictment upon two counts of violating subsection 3 of the Syndicalism Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.984" offset="299886">He claimed in the complaint by reason of his prosecution and the presence of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.531" offset="326113">He was inhibited in the exercise of his First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.334" offset="341264">There were three other plaintiffs who joined in the lawsuit, Jim Dan and Hirsch both alleged that they were members of the Progressive Labor Party, a party that advocated political and industrial change and they felt inhibited in attempting through peaceful and non-violent means to advocate Progressive Labor Party programs in light of the presence of the statute in the prosecution of John Harris.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.833" offset="459233">The fourth plaintiff was a man named Broslawsky who alleged that he was a teacher of history and he taught subjects in which Marxism wasn't involved and he was uncertain what he could say about these matters by reason of the presence of the Act on the books and by reason to prosecution of John Harris.</text>

            <label>Mr. Albert W. Harris, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="154.023" offset="616072">The plaintiffs alleged that there was irreparable injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.905" offset="627566">He alleged no specific facts in support of this claim except the conclusion that they felt inhibited and were prevented from exercising fundamental constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.800" offset="675109">The District Court held that it had jurisdiction to pass on all phases of the Act not only the Section under which John Harris was prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.569" offset="710217">It held that it should not abstain in light of Dombrowski and Zwickler against Koota.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.030" offset="736026">The District Court went on to hold the Act unconstitutional on its face and all of its provisions were no mention whatever of any California case which it -- that it construed any of the sections of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.248" offset="788898">Finally, the Court issued an injunction against the pending prosecution of John Harris.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.196" offset="812722">The appellant submits here that the District Court had no jurisdiction whatever in respect to the claims of Dan, Hirsch, and Broslawsky that is the three plaintiffs who have not been indicted.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="217.695" stopTime="220.456">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="217.695" offset="870713">I think perhaps it was made against Broslawsky?</text>

            <label>Mr. Albert W. Harris, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="220.456" offset="881789">There is no such allegation Your Honor in the complaint and in fact the District Court said in the opinion that it did not believe that the plaintiffs stood in any danger or whatever of prosecution for the conduct that they alleged, that they had engaged in.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.044" offset="960157">In addition, in connection with the jurisdictional question we contend that the court had no jurisdiction to pass on a ninth provision except Section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.870" offset="999445">The Section under which John Harris was charged and upon which he was awaiting trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.279" offset="1021074">Secondly, as to Section 3, the District Court should have abstained.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.154" offset="1040614">Third, on the merits we submit that the Act is valid in light of a narrowing state constructions and a number of state cases that we cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.292" offset="1081156">Finally, all of the things fail and we submit that an injunction was barred under Section 2283 of Title 28 and that there was no irreparable injury in support of the injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.182" offset="1144686">First point in connection with the lack of jurisdiction in respect of the three plaintiffs other than John Harris is basically on the proposition that there were no overt acts by the State of California or any representative of the state that might be construed in any way to have inhibited these plaintiffs in the exercise of federal constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.031" offset="1240085">There had been no arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.082" offset="1244264">There had been no threat of arrest, no searches, no denunciation of these plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.554" offset="1278119">The only claim that they can make is that the mere presence of the Act is sufficient to create a case or controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.987" offset="1319915">We submit that it is not and we submit that under the circumstances here the action of the District Court amounted to an advisory opinion on an abstract question.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.136" offset="1376444">The facts are set forth in the complaint in connection with these three plaintiffs who were not charged do not show any substantial controversy between parties having adverse legal interest of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant declaratory relief and to give right to a case or controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.981" offset="1463902">We relied principally in that connection upon your decision last term in Golden against Zwickler or he dismissed the case because of no case or controversy even though having included that the statute was arguably overbroad and affecting rights on the First Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="393.393" offset="1573512">For four years or thereabouts, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.099" offset="1596395">In connection with Harris himself, we wouldn't argue that there is only an abstract question -- he's under indictment and if the trial has ever held could possibly be convicted, but he's only charged under Section 3 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.511" offset="1658044">We submit that the District Court had no jurisdiction to reach to other sections of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.725" offset="1686883">There are five sections in Section 11401 that deal with different forms of conduct and declare them illegal under the general definition of Criminal Syndicalism contained in Section 11400.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.477" offset="1769848">The legislature provided in connection with this Act that if any portion of it for example Section 3 which relates to the distributing of handbills and alike, printing matters and things of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.417" offset="1833587">That if any part should be held unconstitutional, the rest remaining portions should be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.465" offset="1869845">We have argued in our brief that in the Smith Act cases and the Smith Act had a structure very similar to this with membership provision, with a printing or distributing section, in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.263" offset="1937032">This Court took each section and examined that section and declined to pass on other sections only the section that was specifically involved and had been invoked against the particular defendants there are Dennis, and the Yates case and in the Scales case.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.668" offset="2018638">We think that one of the problems in this case is that the District Court in passing upon sections of the Act that have not been invoked or sections of the Act as to which there was no actual controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.433" offset="2081646">For example, Section 4 is a membership clause provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.546" offset="2106096">It prohibits organizing.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.011" offset="2116023">It prohibits knowingly becoming a member of a criminal syndicalist organization as defined therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.090" offset="2148310">This was struck down by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.274" offset="2161058">Harris was not prosecuted under this Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.081" offset="2172238">There was no contention by the District Attorney nor has there been any contention by anyone in California that the group to which Harris belongs, the Progressive Labor Party I believe, is a proscribe organization or that belonging to it there constitutes any crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.909" offset="2239634">In short, there was no actual controversy on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.083" offset="2252278">And we think one of the problems without -- when you don't have an actual controversy and this case may illustrate that is it there is not an informed judgment passed by the District Court -- the pertinent cases and we cited some of the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.658" offset="2310583">Apparently, we're never considered by the Court and we think this was due probably because of the District Attorney was not interested in the membership clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.472" offset="2345796">He was not prosecuting.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.144" offset="2352483">Harris had not been charged under the membership clause and he was interested only in an abstract way in the validity of that Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.025" offset="2384039">We submit that the decision here is concrete proof of what happens when a court goes ahead and in effect issues an advisory opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.518" offset="2421969">There isn't enough interest in the case apparently to give the informed judgment that constitutional adjudication that we submit calls for.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.695" offset="2470766">Now, in connection with Section 3, with the only Section we feel was properly before the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.494" offset="2501904">We think the District Court should have abstained with three reasons why we believe this to be true.</text>

            <text syncTime="859.869" offset="3439386">There is a contention that many years ago, this may have occurred but there is no contention that at or about that time this case was filed and decided in Los Angeles.</text>

            <text syncTime="927.725" offset="3710851">The decision over 20 years ago in the Danskin case by Justice Traynor made a very clear that in the view of California Supreme Court -- the California Criminal Syndicalism Act couldn't be evaluated simply on its face and in its own terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.294" offset="3785143">But it had to be evaluated in light of decisions by this Court in the area for the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.997" offset="3807922">In fact, Justice Traynor said that the Act could only be applied to prohibit conduct where there was imminent danger but advocacy will give rise to the evils that the state may properly prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.306" offset="3865182">That is language that is very reminiscent and it's very close to the language by this Court in the Brandenburg case last term when you struck down the Ohio Criminal Syndicalism Law on the ground that it was not limited to speech or advocacy directed to inciting violent action, and it contained no conditions that such action be likely under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.554" offset="3970194">We submit that a fair reading of Danskin gives a very close parallel with your decision in Brandenburg and you can reasonably anticipate that the California Supreme Court if it sustains the law at all would sustain it under that kind of a clarifying and narrowing construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.485" offset="4045845">Now, in connection with Section 3 itself, the so-called circulating or distributing search in the O'Malley case which the People against O'Malley which is cited in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.174" offset="4088686">The state court many years ago in anticipation of many of the doctrines that have developed held that to prosecute and convict a person under this Section it had to be proven that he understood the doctrines in the material and the handbills that he was handing out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.933" offset="4151693">That he wasn't just out there handing out something because somebody told him to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.765" offset="4167053">He had to understand it and he had to intend to bring about the consequences that is the unlawful acts, the unlawful means, terroristic means that are proscribed under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.010" offset="4208013">He had to have to intent himself to do that and in addition there had to be a clear and present danger of such unlawful acts necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.714" offset="4242808">This is very close we submit to what the decisions of this Court have held in the intervening years in the Dennis case and many other cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1078.598" offset="4314384">They said the criminal anarchy statute there was given a narrow construction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1087.808" offset="4351164">All that gave a clarifying and narrowing construction to those sections the Dennis, Yates, and Scales decisions and they each -- each of those cases finds its parallel in one of the provisions in the Criminal Syndicalism Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.147" offset="4412500">This is my case such as Baggett -- the Baggett case, Zwickler case, Zwickler against Koota.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.765" offset="4443011">What the court felt that there was no chance of the statute could be saved but in effect an expression but it could not be saved by narrowing construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.648" offset="4474567">In fact we think this is a classic example of the other extreme.</text>

            <text syncTime="1445.295" offset="5781107">Well, I think we don't have any present as to precisely what would happen under those circumstances Your Honor, but I think clear and present danger is one of those elements that would be tested at the trial as oppose to the grand jury indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.599" offset="5842338">The grand jury indictment is just put the man to trial not to convict him and there is an evidence in this transcript which would indicate the clear and present danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.848" offset="5879327">But, I don't think that under our procedure it's called for that particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.680" offset="5902629">Now, it's been argued that the application for 999 (a) relief which was denied and then a petition for hearing to the California Supreme Court was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.386" offset="5941499">It's been claimed by the appellees that this in effect gave the state court a chance to limit the statute in its application and they didn't take that chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.790" offset="5979115">We don't think that is a sound argument for the reasons I've mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.923" offset="5995624">999 (a) does not embrace that question of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.024" offset="6008059">It embraces only the question evidentiary question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.555" offset="6022165">Secondly, there are considerations in any pretrial motion of this kind in addition to the legal question that is presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.336" offset="6065319">There is a question of whether you should disrupt the criminal trial or whether you should not whether you should let him proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.039" offset="6092069">The application of the State Supreme Court is like the application to this Court for certiorari so probably discretionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.463" offset="6121848">And we don't think this issue has been properly presented to the California courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.295" offset="6141179">We're confident that when it is, the statute will be limited and brought within constitutional limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.800" offset="6179109">The place in California procedure where this should really be accomplished is in the jury instructions and then if those are not adequate in the event that Harris is convicted of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.960" offset="6223830">Possibility is he may not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.076" offset="6232294">If he is convicted there can be a review on a full record of the instructions as applied under the evidence in light of the statute and all of their controlling cases -- not a simple question, a complex question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.557" offset="6282136">We think that that is the time for review and think it will not prejudice John Harris to wait that time for review of the interest which he is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.641" offset="6334485">And that is whether he's going to be held guilty of violating subsection 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.746" offset="6354965">Certainly, the trial court in passing on a demur that was -- it was no authority of interpretation by the state courts of this Section of the Criminal Syndicalism Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.586" offset="6398328">Now, there are procedures available in California that perhaps could secure a ruling pretrial on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.288" offset="6437094">They were not invoked here, habeas corpus might lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.121" offset="6452454">A rare prohibition in the sense of the normal extraordinary writ not the special statutory 999 (a) might possibly lie in this situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1625.020" offset="6499997">These were the cases that are referred to in the briefs filed by the appellees as showing this opportunity given to the state courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1648.614" offset="6594456">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.819" offset="6619220">The ultimate question as we view it is whether or not the California Criminal Syndicalism Act is unconstitutional in violating the First Amendment and whether the District Court in so ruling was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.148" offset="6700513">But long before that ultimate question is reached there is concededly a serious threshold question and we the appellees or particularly appellee Harris has to succeed in crossing that threshold in order to prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.987" offset="6795912">The threshold question is whether or not where there is a special procedure in a state for the raising of federal as well as state constitutional questions prior to trial as there is in State of California and as frankly and candidly fairly stated by Mr. Harris.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.168" offset="6912627">Where there is a special procedure for raising both the constitutionality of statute on its face and as applied and the sufficiency of the evidence adduce before the grand jury in connection with such statute and where a defendant charged with an offense has exhausted every available -- first, where there's a procedure available to him and where he has taken every step under that procedure and having failed in these steps to secure a narrowing of the statute or a dismissal of the cases filing the First Amendment whether or not if and in the case involving only the expression of opinion, only speech -- pure speech unaccompanied by plus or conduct or acts or anything other than the expression of opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.295" offset="7189107">And question is therefore, when a defendant in that circumstance under that kind of a procedure in a state court after having failed to secure narrowing of the statute in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.651" offset="7266534">By a procedure available to him to secure such a narrowing whether he can it be then and only then repairs to United States District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.739" offset="7306867">Whether the United States District Court then if it fails refuses to abstain then abuses its discretion in such failure to abstain.</text>

            <text syncTime="1861.045" offset="7444167">In the first place, it is set forth in the complaint filed in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.379" offset="7473424">And the record at page 2 and particularly in paragraph 8 on page 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.700" offset="7554717">The prior to the filing of a proceeding in the federal court, the plaintiff Harris appellee here had filed proceedings in all of the state courts of California and the Section 995 and 999 (a) to which I shall refer to the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.140" offset="7624516">That's paragraph 8, page 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.161" offset="7632562">Now, in addition to that Your Honor, I do want to once I emphasize -- I suppose when it shouldn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.616" offset="7670387">I emphasize two matters with respect to the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.796" offset="7691180">One is we submitted to the District Court in its request the leaflets which are the subject matter of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.568" offset="7742171">We have set forth these leaflets now in the appendix to our supplemental brief as we have set forth the entire transcript of the proceeding and before the grand jury namely all of the evidence against this defendant before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.995" offset="7807896">Now, in addition to that Your Honor because few of the factors is one of a number of cases which are going to be argued before Your Honors on the issue of abstention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.696" offset="7862753">We thought this Court ought to available to it, all of the proceedings in the California courts, the proceeding before the Superior Court -- trial court, the proceeding before the Court of Appeals and in the Supreme Court of California, so that Your Honors will see that we raised the federal constitutional questions as well as state constitutional questions but because my client is not well-heeled and was permitted to proceed in forma pauperis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.474" offset="8009874">We didn't have the funds, we didn't print the entire record of the proceedings in the California Court, but there are lodged with the clerk of this Court for Your Honors' examination and should you be so advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.410" offset="8061597">However, we have quote from that record which is in the possession of a clerk, portions which we think a highly relevant and we printed them in spite of lack of funds in this appendix with you Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.601" offset="8126380">Now, as stated by the Attorney General plus before stated by the Attorney General in his brief the Attorney General says that the defendant has been charged with acts in violation of the California Criminal Syndicalism law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.842" offset="8207360">When they called it what one wants but the act with which he is charged consists solely of the distribution of two handbills on two separate days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.589" offset="8262322">Therefore, he's charged with two violations under the California Criminal Syndicalism law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.870" offset="8287399">A violation of the California Criminal Syndicalism law considered was considered by the California legislature very serious when this statute was adopted 50 years ago so that he faces a penitentiary sentence of 28 years, 14 years for each pamphlet distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.202" offset="8360751">The pamphlets only it was being distributed on two -- one day after another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.636" offset="8390531">Moreover, there could be no question of what these leaflets considerably highly critical of the Los Angeles police were distributed at a proper place at a proper time, on a proper occasion, a Negro had been shot and killed by white officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.244" offset="8500976">He grows in Los Angeles for a concern about the matter, an inquest was being held as to the cause of the death and these leaflets conceivably couched in very strong language were distributed outside of the inquest hearing on the steps of the building where the inquest was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.003" offset="8599928">Now, I must hasten to have one thing, Your Honors or to try to clear up the matter about which there could be some misunderstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.550" offset="8642142">The leaflets which this defendant distributed as Mr. Harris stated to you Your Honors, are not the horrendously leaflets issued by the American Nazi Party which are attached to the appellant's opening brief which have nothing to do with the defendant which three leaflets pertained to statements made by organizations with which the defendant has no relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.543" offset="8762096">Leaflets which were never introduced before the grand jury, leaflets which couldn't have been introduced before the grand jury because they are dated two years after the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.013" offset="8812042">They are offered to Your Honors as evidence that I understand or I assume that California is in great peril from organizations that want to destroy it and therefore this indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.623" offset="8874423">Therefore, these leaflets two years thereafter are relevant to the indictment of the defendant two years before.</text>

            <text syncTime="2439.482" offset="9757884">At the text of the Criminal Syndicalism Act, you will find on page 8 that it is an act which proscribes doctrine and preset so it is an act aimed at the expression of opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.812" offset="9819220">And as Mr. Harris -- at least Mr. Harris, the assistant attorney general that defendant Harris was charged with subsection 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.245" offset="9864882">If Your Honor will take a third of a minute to look at that, it's on page 9 you will find that that makes it a crime to print, publish, edit, issue, circulate and invite and teach and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.480" offset="9925904">So that so far as any charge against this defendant is concerned or so far as any charge it's possible on the state, purely a charged involving the expression of opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2800.095" offset="11200366">The California statute itself and the California courts have ruled that relief must be accorded to a defendant where the evidence is insufficient as to any essential element of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.362" offset="11285420">This case, the essential element of the offense as Your Honors decided unanimously just his last term in Brandenburg versus Ohio is that the advocacy must be accompanied by incitement to imminent lawless action urged upon all of the California courts was that there was no evidence before the grand jury as there is no charged in the indictment of any incitement to -- that the incitement as distinguished from advocacy of abstract doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.520" offset="11442051">And incidentally, Mr. Justice Harlan, I know you'll be interested to know that the District Court was greatly persuaded by Your Honor's ruling in Yates and in Mogul.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.680" offset="11498684">Although, maybe this record I just made is irrelevant to my -- to the point I'm making but the distinction between abstract advocacy on the one hand and incitement imminent lawless action on the other which distinction is not drawn by the statute and hence it is overbroad and vague under decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.321" offset="11593247">That distinction was never made, that distinction was never recognized by any in California court in claims made by this defendant to that court, and therefore, two more things then I'm through with my time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.344" offset="11681332">Therefore we do not agree with our adversaries that the California Criminal Syndicalism Act an act aimed at preset at the preachment of preset and doctrine as I've indicated have ever been narrow by the California courts to comply with the limitations that this Court has imposed in Yates, Mogul and in another cases and particularly in Brandenburg.</text>

            <text syncTime="2986.114" offset="11944438">But Mr. Justice Harlan, it is my position that a District Court -- or I want to put this when I say this firmly but of course very respectfully does not barge into a state prosecution when there is a state procedure which authorizes and provides for relief prior to trial which state procedure has been exhausted by a defendant in every California court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.608" offset="12098351">And in our view, it is no disrespect to a state court, it is no frustration of the authority of a state court if in that circumstance when a state court has been given every opportunity to narrow a statute and has not been so for a defendant to then repair to the federal courts particularly when it couldn't come to this Court because that situation is not a final judgment reviewable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3156.462" offset="12625816">Now, I will come to 2283 and there are two things to be said about 2283 in connection with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.123" offset="12688405">First, 2283 was never raised by the District Attorney in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.006" offset="12723931">I don't know how important that is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.542" offset="12730096">It may be after I explain in the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.541" offset="12742113">In the notice of appeal to this Court 2283 was not mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.422" offset="12769593">In the jurisdictional statement to this Court 2283 was not relied upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.371" offset="12793417">Although, shortly thereafter the attorney general filed a memorandum in support to jurisdictional statement raising for the first time Section 2283.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.680" offset="12842632">Of course, if Section 2283 is a jurisdictional statute and I don't understand that's the position of Mr. Harris, it can be raised here whether or not raised below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.546" offset="12890175">But I make some point of a fact that it wasn't raised below for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.642" offset="12914521">The District Court essentially made a declaration that the statute was unconstitutional on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.232" offset="12952869">Then, if I may say so, to help the District Attorney it went on and issued a preliminary injunction sua sponte not on request of the plaintiffs because all was pending before the District Court was a motion to dismiss by the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.418" offset="13053597">It issued the preliminary injunction in new order to give the District Attorney an opportunity to appeal to this Court and secure a review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.475" offset="13097900">And had Section 2283 didn't raise in the court below very possible, the court below might have decided not to issue any injunction for if declaration for statute was unconstitutional it would probably be insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.103" offset="13152340">Now, that's part of the argument but not the main part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.211" offset="13168744">Now Section 2283 contains three subdivisions each of which in our view was complied with in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.539" offset="13234155">One of the subdivisions of Section 2283, one of the exceptions of Section 2283 is where an order of a District Court is an aid of its jurisdiction or in aid of its judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.774" offset="13307089">At the time this matter was heard by three-judge District Court, no response of pleading had been filed by the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.458" offset="13349825">All it was before the court was a motion to dismiss which motion to dismiss, the District Court rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.818" offset="13379187">It had jurisdiction over the cause so Mr. Harris concedes and therefore to preserve its jurisdiction and its authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.983" offset="13415863">Ultimately, later to enter to a judgment a declaratory judgment under Zwickler versus Koota which doesn't involve the injunction of statute at all and which was the -- the only matter which the District Court really decided in Zwickler versus Koota, Your Honors with unanimous although that it is special and interesting, and exciting concurring opinion by Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.727" offset="13514815">So, what the Court did therefore was to issue an injunction to sustain its jurisdiction in order to be able to effectuate its ultimate judgment which ultimate judgment could have been and might have been only a declaratory judgment which is as we say under Zwickler versus Koota, it could have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.180" offset="13600705">And finally of course, Your Honors we make the argument though it's – thought this Court has never yet decided the matter that the Civil Rights Act under which this suit was filed in the District Court which authorizes the District Court to grant relief by way of damages and injunction, is one of the exceptions to the injunction statute and that the District Court below therefore was merely complying with the authority which the Congress had conferred upon it in the Civil Rights Act in issuing the injunction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.341" offset="13773322">Again and this also dealt an injunction not necessary in this case, not issue at the request of the plaintiffs but is there to help the District Attorney and to help Mr. Harris.</text>

            <text syncTime="3607.015" offset="14428056">Four minutes Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.267" offset="14437042">I didn't get to the last two points in opening remarks was the time of problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.345" offset="14465358">I didn't mean to waive any point in connection with either the merits of the Act or the impact of Section 2283 which we set forth a very considerable length in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.055" offset="14512170">We think it barred the injunction here in looking at the complaint which is -- appears in the appendix and on at page 7 it is quite apparent to me that a permanent injunction was prayed for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction in fact were all prayed for by the plaintiff John Harris and by the other plaintiffs here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.899" offset="14611540">We are -- we still urge and I think if you examine the cases that have been cited by the appellees that the 999 (a) procedure does not permit the raising of the constitutional question that they presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.024" offset="14676010">The argued it but they didn't do it within a procedural framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.414" offset="14689593">They would permit the state courts to decide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.897" offset="14703491">We also submit that however, whatever our view might be or whatever the District Court's understanding might be of the procedural niceties in California shouldn't be determinative of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.790" offset="14755109">The 2283 still bars an injunction without any regard to what interlocutory procedures are provided for in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.712" offset="14798785">And as far as the declaratory judgment is concerned, we urged that the statute can properly be save and under what is clear this is a consideration that should've prompt the District Court to abstain and let the statute be thrash out in the state courts and let John Harris have his remedy and I think there can be no real doubt that he has a real and meaningful remedy within the California courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.968" offset="14907768">Only a week ago, Monday, this Court in O'Leary against Schneider number 1225 affirm per curiam a case out of Louisiana where the federal District Court have abstained from getting into a Louisiana prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.391" offset="14989479">And there, there had been an application to the Louisiana courts, in fact, an application of the Louisiana Supreme Court for relief by the defendant during the course of his application to the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3760.897" offset="15043500">This was not deemed to be of any great consequence under their particular situation and we think it is somewhat comparable with the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.969" offset="15079863">Now, what the procedural niceties are in Louisiana, I have no idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.163" offset="15096581">And we don't think that that this case should turn on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.502" offset="15109956">2283 clearly barred the injunction, the statute can be salvaged and so far as Harris is concerned and certainly no more than the one prosecution that he is facing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3794.392" offset="15177561">There is no -- I think the delay here is mentioned in a question has been very considerable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.446" offset="15221760">Now, the case proceeded in the state courts and no doubt it would have been terminated long sentence and we stand here four years with the State of California in the situation of been unable to proceed against John Harris whatever the merits of that case might be, and more importantly unable to proceed within the constitutional limits of the Criminal Syndicalism Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3828.596" offset="15314338">It's not a question of zealous prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.124" offset="15328444">It's a question of enforcing the law within the proper constitutional limits that this Court has laid down and it certainly suggest in Brandenburg that within the Criminal Syndicalism Act there is an area within which the state may properly act or prohibit the advocacy of criminal means whether it be killing all cops, whether it be blowing up a building, person or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3861.224" offset="15444846">We think the state should be able to prove the causative relationship between the advocacy and these criminal acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.104" offset="15472327">Thank you.</text>
