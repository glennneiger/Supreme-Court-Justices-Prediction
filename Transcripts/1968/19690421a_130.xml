            <text syncTime="338.043" offset="1455522">Petitioner had no notice of hearing before the wages where garnishee does mention, and the co -- because the garnishment action and the principle action were commenced simultaneously by service upon her of the complaint in the principal action at her place of employment, at the same time the complaint in the garnishment action was served upon her employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.083" offset="1543711">In fact, while it did not occur under the statute, it would have been entirely possible to serve her 10 days later, and the first notice she might have received would've been after the sum of her pay had indeed been garnered.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.137" offset="1595956">This case is, therefore, unlike a post judgment garnishment case in which there has been an adjudication of the existence of the debt.</text>

            <text syncTime="392.724" offset="1674219">Funds owing to petitioner here have been withheld by her employer upon order of the Court, and those funds will not paid either to her or to her employer until the termination of the principal action which has been, in this particular case, has been stayed and has not yet been heard and, indeed in any case, will be heard some considerable period of time after the wages have been attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.967" offset="1783202">In the trial court, petitioner made a motion to dismiss the garnishment proceeding on the ground of unconstitutionality under the Due Process Clause of the Constitution, asserting that there was neither notice nor hearing as required by the Constitution, and this claim was denied by all of the Wisconsin Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.167" offset="1856031">In relating what occurred to the Court, I have outlined essentially the statutory scheme, but I'd like to set it forth somewhat more fully.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.915" offset="1895006">The way actions like this start is that, in an action upon contract, in action in tort, or an action upon a judgment, upon payment of $3-fee to the clerk of the Court, a complaint in garnishment -- summons in complaint in garnishment may be obtained by a creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.215" offset="1960208">The garnishment complaint need allege merely that the cause is one of the three specified in the statute, contract tort or judgment, the amount of the plaintiff's claim against the defendant, and that the garnishee has a property owing to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.465" offset="2029275">That's all.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.999" offset="2031365">The garnishment complaint and summons must be served upon the principal defendant no more than 10 days after service on the garnishee, and the garnishee then may either hold the money or may pay it into Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.244" offset="2092387">Under the statute, the garnishment action is not permitted to be tried until after judgment in the principal action.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.187" offset="2120077">And as I said, depending upon the outcome of the principal action, the moneys are then distributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.412" offset="2157066">Our principal claim here is based upon the Due Process Clause of the Constitution, which we assert and we submit needs no elaboration in this Court, requires notice and hearing before adverse judicial action may be taken against one to deprive that person of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.829" offset="2246719">But to demonstrate that in this case we are hardly speaking of empty ritual or formalism and that we're not addressing the Constitution to some procedural quirk, our brief contains a considerable quantity of material showing the well-recognized social and economic evils that this type of statute brings about.</text>

            <text syncTime="1040.195" offset="4264103">As for example, the complaint in garnishment did not say that case was in contract tort or on a judgment, but it does not become an examination of the validity of the underlying debt, which would be the real issue, and indeed the entire statutory scheme is focused in the other direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.668" offset="4338082">The entire statutory scheme says you may not try the principal act, the garnishment action, until after the principal action is concluded.</text>

            <text syncTime="2201.775" offset="8910451">In a matter of a replevin, this can be started in one of two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.208" offset="8944201">First of all, you can start the replevin by the issuance of your summons, take it to the sheriff without any seizure, and the matter is then returnable within 8 to 15 days after issuance, and it can be heard by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.823" offset="9014627">At that time, the Court can enter a judgment in replevin, as I term it, in the alternative, either you get the cash or the merchandise back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.346" offset="9052766">This is used where you have a conditional sales contract or today, under the uniform code, a security device.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.752" offset="9086412">The other way or the other alternative on a replevin is that you can issue the same papers but, at the time of issuance to the sheriff, you post a bond with the sheriff to double the value of the merchandise which you seek to repossess.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.755" offset="9150360">The sheriff, then, serves a copy upon the debtor or defendant and leaves a copy of the bond with him, takes the furniture in his possession, and I'm saying the sheriff's possession, where it is held, pending the determination by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.638" offset="9221935">The same type of a remedy is true in the attachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.678" offset="9242102">And in these two cases, you post a bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.874" offset="9258820">This you do not have to do in a garnishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3349.312" offset="13500583">So, I feel that the protection is well afforded and that, as Mr. Greenber had indicated, there had been five attempts or five Bills introduced into the legislature to change it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3430.740" offset="13826382">There's been some bit of going outside the record on the nature of this debt and I don't know that it's important that it could be asserted that these are the facts and they'd be considered as a hypothetical situation, if the Court likes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.416" offset="13872985">Indeed, it would be asserted that she had a defense here, that the defense was inducement of her signature by fraud, that her husband was in jail, that she subsequently was divorced from him, and it was a defense of a sort which would take some -- perhaps some considerable development of evidence and discovery in order to present it properly to the Court, adequately to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.368" offset="13976848">This leads me to Mr. Justice White's inquiry about what will be a proper standard for a prejudgment garnishment if some sort of hearing or procedure were to be established.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.528" offset="14021465">It certainly should be a standard, if one were adopted, which would adequately enable development of whatever defense, the party, the defendant in the principal action might have which would involve, in cases of this sort, sometimes a considerable discovery because many of the facts are principally within the possession of the creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.665" offset="14134000">Usually, the note is in documents and so forth, particularly for people who deal with small-loan companies of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.175" offset="14176110">There was a mention of the Uniform Consumer Credit Code that has not been adopted in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.683" offset="14198053">My information is that it has been adopted only in the State of Utah.</text>
