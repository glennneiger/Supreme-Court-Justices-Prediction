            <text syncTime="41.913" offset="271026">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.789" offset="286490">This case which is here on direct appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania grows out of the efforts to uncover and prosecute the members of a multi-state ring which specializes in extorting money from victims upon threat to accuse them of homosexual activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.908" offset="378964">The indictments in the present case were returned under a federal interstate racketeering statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.386" offset="404877">The so-called Travel Act Section 1952 of the Federal Criminal Code which makes it a federal offense to travel in interstate commerce with the intent to carry on an unlawful activity including extortion in violation of the laws of the state in which committed and thereafter to perform an act promoting that objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.718" offset="510203">The indictments in the present case were on appellee's motion dismissed by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.581" offset="537684">The Court found first that in using the term extortion, Congress intended that the term should track closely the legal understanding of that term under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.895" offset="587003">But that in Pennsylvania, the crime captioned extortion is the common law form of extortion, that is the crime committed by a public officer who takes an unauthorized or excessive fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.030" offset="647502">In that sense, the appellees had not been alleged to be public officers and in fact were conceded not to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.031" offset="679476">The indictment failed the state in offense against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.654" offset="697971">It's the Government's contention that this statute uses the term extortion and the other terms that are listed in the statute generically, so that conduct has referred to a sort of criminal activity, extortion at acts and that interstate travel to promote this type of act is reached by the federal statute so long as the conduct is made unlawful by the law of the state whatever the particular label the state happens to attach to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.097" offset="827747">The issue before the Court this morning is whether the Government's construction rather then the District Court is the correct one.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.457" offset="861184">The Travel Act which was enacted in 1961 is part of a series of measures to combat organized crime and racketeering makes it a general offense provides generally that interstate travel to promote an unlawful activity as subsequently defined is a federal violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.549" offset="953553">Interstate -- unlawful activity could be in violation of the law of the state or of the United States and for relevant purposes the statute makes it a federal violation to travel in interstate commerce to carry on extortion in violation of the laws of several -- of a particular state.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.289" offset="1032547">The allegations in the present indictments alleged that at least one of the conspirators traveled in interstate commerce from Chicago to Philadelphia in two cases and from Camden, New Jersey to Philadelphia, and the third with the intent to promote an activity unlawful under Pennsylvania law.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.022" offset="1131499">The controversy in this case arises from the fact that under Pennsylvania law, extortion at conduct is termed blackmail rather than extortion but Pennsylvania does have as I mentioned the continuation of the original ancient common law and notion of extortion, the acceptance by public officer of unlawful fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.585" offset="1225749">The District Court on its analysis of the language of the statute and its legislative history concluded that Congress intended when it spoke of extortion and violation of the laws of the state in which committed that the federal term should track closely the legal understanding of that term in state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.308" offset="1320626">We contend that this construction of the statute, this serves the remedial objectives of this federal legislation and in supportively narrows its plain meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.048" offset="1375587">I should like to turn first to the background and purpose of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.201" offset="1392201">I mentioned that this was one of a series of measures submitted by the Department of Justice in 1961 to bring federal resources and the federal criminal process to bear on a problem which had outgrown the capacity of state and local governments to deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.168" offset="1460015">And that is the situation which we've encountered through the ability of the modern organized syndicate criminal to conduct illegal operations from a remote state sending minions back and forth across state lines to carry out various forms of illicit activity using the long distance telephone to manage or carry out various forms of violations of state laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.551" offset="1577566">This mobility and this diffusion of organization made it extremely difficult for state and local authorities to investigate or to prosecute violations of their local laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.723" offset="1630229">Now, the statute as it's clear both from its language and its legislative history does not pruport to close off the channels of interstate commerce to all attempts to violate state law because its focus was organized crime and racketeering, the organs of communication from one state to another were to be interrupted for those who would travel in commerce to carry out unlawful activities only with respect to activities which years of investigation by state and local crime commissions by the Federal Government and by Congressional Committees had shown to be the mainstays of organized crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.953" offset="1803160">And for that reason, the term “unlawful activity” in the Travel Act is defined to include only business enterprises involving gambling, prostitution, liquor and narcotics violation and extortion, bribery and arson in violation of state or Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.158" offset="1891976">These were the activities that these investigations had established to be one of the principal occupations of the organized modern nationwide criminal operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.820" offset="1942653">The question before the Court is what Congress intended to reach by using the term “extortion in violation of the laws of the state in which committed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="469.806" offset="1982568">The District Court has held that in Pennsylvania and therefore as it recognized in at least 12 other states which also do not condemn extortionate activities under the heading extortion but instead maintained some continuation of the common law notion of extortion that this federal statute reaches only travel in interstate commerce into a state by a public official of that state to accept an unauthorized fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.226" offset="2116315">Now, it is our contention that this narrow construction by the District Court is plainly an error.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.038" offset="2147558">Abusive office was not one of the principal forms of violations that motivated Congress to pass this federal legislation dealing with interstate travel to promote extortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.953" offset="2195205">There are several reasons that make that clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.357" offset="2208789">First, it's unlikely that a public official of a state is going to be a member of an organized criminal syndicate but in any event, his opportunity in the District Court's analysis to commit extortion in the common law ancient sense derives from his position as a public officer within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.666" offset="2294053">And therefore, he is not the type of individual who is unlikely to be amenable to investigation and prosecution by the local authorities.</text>

            <text syncTime="556.596" offset="2329788">In reading your -- in reading the briefs of this case, I was impressed by the -- negatively impressed by the seeming lack of legislative history bearing really a very explicitly on this question is -- and I assume there is not, is that correct?</text>

            <label>Mr. Philip A. Lacovara</label>
            <text syncTime="572.549" offset="2393527">Yes, the Senate or House hearings do not reveal any specific focus on the question of what extortion was meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.677" offset="2434069">However, I think it is significant that in the course of wending its way through Congress, this Bill was sought to be amended by the House in a way in which I think will illustrate the actual intent and focus that Congress had in using the term extortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.515" offset="2509406">As I mentioned, the unlawful activities are defined to mean four illegal business operations as well extortion, bribery, and arson.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.229" offset="2548276">The House Committee subsequently ratified by the full House tried to limit extortion and bribery to offenses committed in connection with the illegal businesses otherwise defined in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.006" offset="2615359">The Department of Justice vigorously objected, the Department of Justice had sponsored this measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.965" offset="2639182">The Department vigorously objected to that amendment and wrote to Chairman Celler of the House Committee that this amendment would eliminate from the purview of the statute extortions which were unrelated to the other business enterprises mentioned in the statute but which were and had historically been major forms of extortion perpetuated by organized crime and this letter from the Justice Department explicitly mentioned that such forms of extortion practice by organized crime include shakedown rackets, shylocking or the charging of usurious interests on loans, and labor extortion.</text>

            <text syncTime="788.756" offset="3258389">Our basic argument as we went to in great length in the brief is that the background of the legislation shows that we're dealing with the types of activity engaged in by organized crime syndicates and public officer exactions are not a principal form of this activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.872" offset="3334875">The other terms used in the statute also are clearly used in their generic sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.214" offset="3360266">The term gambling or narcotics violations clearly doesn't and as the hearings themselves will show, it does not point only to a section of a state law which is captioned gambling or narcotic violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.391" offset="3420975">This is an effort by Congress to refer us to categories of crime which if made unlawful by the state where the activity is going to be conducted.</text>

            <text syncTime="902.995" offset="3715323">I'd like to resume by returning to the point that Mr. Justice Stewart raised in his question noting the relative sparseness of the legislative history on the question of what Congress understood by the term extortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.989" offset="3775300">I began to respond to the question by suggesting that since Congress dealt in a clause in which it uses the term extortion, with another offense which it termed bribery that the District Court's analysis would in Pennsylvania and about at least seven and perhaps many more states made one of the other of these two terms redundant because in Pennsylvania, the crime caption extortion is simply a form of bribery.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.423" offset="3897031">That I think is not the limit of the fair inferences that can be drawn from the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.052" offset="3927542">I mentioned earlier that this legislation was considered along with the package of other measures that have been submitted in 1961 to deal with the subject of organized crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.105" offset="3979786">Two other statutes which were submitted and being considered by Congress of the very same time, the hearings in both the House and the Senate were held on a series of measures and two of the bills that were before Congress at the time, used the term extortion in the sense that we suggest that Congress understood in passage of the Travel Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.270" offset="4068498">The first was a measure to amend and expand the Fugitive Felon Act which at the time was limited only to those who had fled from states to avoid prosecution for certain defined felonies, certain enumerated felonies, one of which was extortion under -- by threat of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.388" offset="4152926">Another one of the measures that Congress was considering at the very time that it had Travel Act's terms before it was a proposal to provide for a grant of immunity in situations where there was an arguable violation of either the Labor Management Relations Act or the Hobbs Act which punished opposite sides of the same coin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.954" offset="4251146">The Hobbs Act punishes extortion presumably covering labor extortion and the 1960 --1947 Labor Act makes it an offense for an employer to give money or thing of value to a union official apart from his wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.271" offset="4340485">So that there was before Congress at the time it was considering the Travel Act two pieces of legislation which used the term extortion in the precised generic sense of a coercive exaction under threat or force or accusation that had been used to underlie the earlier measures.</text>

            <text syncTime="1092.219" offset="4472247">That's the source of the difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.768" offset="4482487">We have suggested on a related alternative argument that blackmail has for a hundred years or more have been considered a synonym for extortion and indeed the Pennsylvania courts and the Pennsylvania legislature used these terms interchangeably and in cases which the District Court saw fit to reject as ill considered, the Pennsylvania State Courts have in fact sustained indictments drawn under the blackmail statute's alleged in the instant indictments even though those indictments in the State Courts charged extortion by accusation of heinous crime rather than blackmail as the statute has captioned.</text>

            <text syncTime="1148.292" offset="4696586">In our appendix to our brief, Mr. Chief Justice, we set forth that there are at least 13 states which punish this form of conduct under a blackmail statute and at least seven of those states, extortion is a separately defined offense but it relates to the common law form of extortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.449" offset="4785194">Now, in it, we also set forth that there are other classifications of extortion at conduct in other states, robbery, threats, and menaces.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.392" offset="4816959">In a number of those other states, similarly, there is a crime expressly called extortion that does relate either to the public officer exaction or to some other anachronistic, we might say, notions of extortion in five or six states, the only offense called extortion is the charging by a Railroad company of an unfair tariff and presumably under the District Court's mechanical analysis, the only offenses that would be reached by the Travel Act in those states would be the submission by mail of a bill by a railroad company of an inflated charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.389" offset="4984978">That is not in any way related to the organized crime focus of this measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.490" offset="5001383">We did not collect in our appendix all of the possible permutations of relating the categorization of the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.030" offset="5047463">You'll -- you will notice Mr. Chief Justice that the last category on page 30 and 31 of our brief lists statutes which make some mention in their caption of extortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.282" offset="5092498">They -- some of them are however hybrids like fear used to extort or larceny by extortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.440" offset="5117158">In some of those states, there is a crime caption simply extortion which is the public officer exaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.880" offset="5142862">How the District Court would deal with these we can't imagine but this confirms we believe that we should be looking not to labels but to substance in interpreting the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.200" offset="5200123">The focus of the congressional concern in this area was with the type of activity which years of investigation had shown organized crime syndicates customarily resorted to in maulting their profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.787" offset="5262503">They had not be shown and no one has yet suggested not even the District Court that acceptance of unlawful fees is a traditional form of organized crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.230" offset="5308270">We consider rather that Congress used the term extortion as it used the other terms in the statute in its generic sense as relating to a category of possibly unlawful conduct i.e. an attempt to obtain money or property from an individual by a threat either to commit injury upon him or his family or his property or to obtain some advantage or to accuse him of a heinous crime or some other indictable offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.994" offset="5439300">The District Court supported its analysis by pointing to the language of the statute and to the undisputed congressional policy of respecting the variations in state criminal law definitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.575" offset="5505651">Neither of these factors however supports the District Court's analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.791" offset="5522578">First, the language of the statute does not even say that it is an offense to travel in interstate commerce to engage in activity in violation of extortion laws of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.240" offset="5568345">We might have a somewhat graver problem in accepting the government's construction if that were the usage but we have instead an act which punishes interstate commerce to promote extortion in violation of the laws of state in which committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.026" offset="5635427">We suggest, this is quite susceptible and is infact of the construction and is in fact the intended construction of meaning that Congress was concerned about a category of activity and so long as that activity, that type of activity is actually made unlawful under the laws of the state in which the activity is committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.817" offset="5718601">It is reached by this federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.977" offset="5731244">Similarly, the congressional awareness that the contours of criminal activity will vary from state to state even within a particular type of activity, in no way suggests that the label that the particular state happens to affix in outlawing some forms of that activity should rigidly control the interpretation of this federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.971" offset="5827271">The exchanges in the legislative history relied on by the District Court related to gambling, it was expressly recognized that for several reasons, an individual who operated a lawful gambling business in Nevada would not be in violation of this statute if he traveled to promote that activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.839" offset="5906683">Now, the District Court somehow extrapolated from that that Congress intended that the definition of the terms used in the federal statute should track closely their legal understanding under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.437" offset="5973138">The cited passage in no way supports that no one either on the committee or any of the witnesses testifying indicated that whether or not the gambler, the Las Vegas gambler's travel was lawful was going to turn on whether or not his activities were dealt with under the statute talking of gambling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.680" offset="6058088">It was assumed throughout the legislative history that even if the state had a statute outlawing a lottery under the statute gambling and outlawed book making separately under a statute entitled book making.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.955" offset="6119215">A bookmaker who travels in interstate commerce would still be in violation of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1535.289" offset="6244498">There's a reported decision to that effect, United States versus Hughes in 385 F.2nd where the extortion was conducted in North Carolina which is one of the states listed in our blackmail list and which also has an extortion statute similar to that in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.167" offset="6320044">There was no challenge in that statute to the reach of the extortion term of this legislation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1565.884" offset="6366960">This is another argument that we believe supports our construction even though concededly the legislative history is not expressed on the question of how Congress defined or understood the term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.723" offset="6418265">When Congress legislates on a criminal subject in the 1960s, we think it highly desirable that it be taken to be using terms in their common place everyday sense because it is this sense which the average man of ordinary intelligence who must gauge his conduct by the measure should be held to understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.154" offset="6503946">And as we've seen recent pieces of federal legislations as well as the Pennsylvania judicial and legislative treatment and the scholarly opinions cited in our brief all illustrate that today the 1960s extortion does not mean an exaction by a public official, the mere acceptance of an unauthorized fee even on the absence of any coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.101" offset="6611780">It means rather an attempt to obtain something of value from the individual by making a threat to do some injury to him or to his reputation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1650.358" offset="6704776">If we look to Pennsylvania law to see what a man of ordinary intelligence in Pennsylvania would have had understood this conduct to proscribe, we submit, he would have been on fair notice that the federal statute was prohibiting his conduct even though the conduct is termed blackmail on Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.676" offset="6774053">I've already referred to the judicial decisions in Pennsylvania which it sustained extortion indictments under blackmail statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.748" offset="6814386">The blackmail statutes themselves used the term whoever with intent to extort makes certain types of threats.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.041" offset="6843538">If the individual consulted the general index to the Pennsylvania statues to see what extortion and violation of state laws meant, one of the earliest listing under the general heading extortion is a reference is a to the blackmail statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.834" offset="6910725">There is a cross-reference under the extortion statute in Pennsylvania which says for extortions by others than public officers see the sections involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.990" offset="6951372">So I think not only do we have the ordinary understanding of the average citizen in Pennsylvania and elsewhere in the English speaking world that extortion means a coercive attempt to obtain property under threat but we have expressed authority that Pennsylvania regards this form of conduct as extortion and we see no notice or vagueness problems in the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1831.208" offset="7428159">The law of Pennsylvania in its definition of extortion is not a new or unusual definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.952" offset="7455222">It tracks very closely if I may borrow a term from the District Court's opinion, the common law definition of extortion and it requires without getting any more detailed than is necessary for purposes of this argument that at least one of the parties involved in an exchange of money to do something must be an individual who is a public officer and a public officer who has something to do with the reason why the money is passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.949" offset="7563160">This statute was applied in Pennsylvania to prosecute when they are discovered officials who have breached their duty, their sacred trust to the public and have accepted a bribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.684" offset="7622092">It is not as it has been characterized by the Government in its brief, in its oral argument merely a statute that involves excessive fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.285" offset="7660544">The excessive fee mentioned is solely to exclude the defense that while I didn't know I could charge $2.50 for $1.50 gold license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.690" offset="7698160">This is the statute that Pennsylvania uses when it is necessary to prosecute corrupt officials.</text>

            <text syncTime="2839.207" offset="11460211">The Travel Act merely says that if you travel in interstate commerce to commit a crime in violation of the law of the state, you have committed a separate federal offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="3460.508" offset="13945396">We are dealing here with a specific violation of a law of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.079" offset="13959711">The crime in Pennsylvania that was committed here was a blackmail by accusation of heinous crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.525" offset="13981445">It is a specific statute in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.532" offset="13993462">It is not an undefined thing that's used to be part of something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.119" offset="14003806">It's a specific statute and it was never even in the common law included under the term of extortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.068" offset="14027630">Now, extortion has certainly today expanded and I have to admit it and it can include almost anything that comes close to the area.</text>

            <text syncTime="3490.290" offset="14064515">What I cannot concede that Congress even though it recognized this as an average man, as a good lawyer, as a good legislative research man that Congress intended by the language that it used here to apply this definition of extortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.702" offset="14126164">It could have done so, so easily in a number of other different ways but it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.161" offset="14148002">In this instance, it said in violation of the laws of the state and it had to mean something by that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.743" offset="14170363">A limitation as it appears at least in this instance what that term had to mean something.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.912" offset="14191052">If they had not put in violation of the laws of a state, once again I don't think I would be before this Court even though they had just used the term extortion.</text>
