            <text syncTime="54.788" offset="322539">Petitioners are members of the National Stater Rights Party, a political party committed to white supremacy to which they wish to win adherence to the Democratic process.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.823" offset="370709">Specifically the record shows through running candidate in the Democratic and Republican parties as well as independently.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.408" offset="404982">Their major way of reaching the public is through political street rallies.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.413" offset="429014">On August 6, 1966 in Princess Anne, a sparsely populated town of 1351 persons, petitioners held a rally.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.618" offset="497873">The facts break down roughly two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.934" offset="511143">The circumstances surrounding the issuing of the temporary injunction, and the circumstances and facts of the rally as revealed at the hearing of August 17th which led to the final injunction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.184" offset="572061">The temporary injunction was gotten because at the end of the rally of August 6, another rally for the next evening was announced.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.312" offset="620648">Though no violence nor even any need for police intervention to control the crowd in any way occurred at the August 6th rally.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.024" offset="659519">Town and county officials got an ex parte temporary injunction for 10 days.</text>

            <label>Ms. Eleanor Holmes Norton</label>
            <text syncTime="153.579" offset="717720">Rule BB72 forbids the granting of such an injunction without a showing of immediate, substantial, and irreparable injury to the applicant before an adversary hearing can be held, and expressly grants the right to the judge to communicate informally with the person against to whom the injunction is sought or with his attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.152" offset="807999">No such measures were taken in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.931" offset="819075">Such injunctions are indeed extremely rare in the State of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.957" offset="835166">The temporary order and writ of injunction restrained any “rallies, gatherings, or meetings anywhere in the county that would excite to riot or other illegal acts.”</text>
            <text syncTime="195.077" offset="883649">Though the writ of injunction itself addressed to the parties by name may clear that the court construed any gatherings by this party as enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.445" offset="925132">Not simply those that may excite to riot etcetera, for it enjoined to use of any sound amplification equipment in the course of public meetings, such equipment being necessary to hold such meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.634" offset="981870">A permanent injunction -- the temporary order said might issue upon hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.687" offset="1018128">Petitioners were not able to find representation in time for appear before the return date of August 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.371" offset="1040906">But at that time, they did -- they had secured counsel and they filed an answer asking that the temporary injunction be rescinded.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.793" offset="1074552">Now to the facts and circumstances surrounding the August 6th rally, they were given their first hearing at the August 17th hearing at the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.524" offset="1121468">It is important to note that there was available to the court at the time of the issuing of this ex parte injunction the tape from the August 6th rally, but the court issued the injunction against further rallies without listening to that tape at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.467" offset="1205269">The tape recording reveals a description of the parties aims.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.884" offset="1222928">Particularly repeal of 1965 Civil Rights Act and other Civil Rights Act then under consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.470" offset="1249259">They're speaking caustic terms, was a call to actions but in every case a call explicitly to political action.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.732" offset="1282278">Examples of these are rampant in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.088" offset="1295757">They called for example for those who heard them to “organizing intelligently, fight intelligently.”</text>
            <text syncTime="304.427" offset="1321044">They said for example, that the National States Rights Party advocates every legal, legitimate, and political inaudible word in the book to stop race mixing.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.233" offset="1368273">As to the specific political actions urged to the whites they said, for example, that they were to phone and write in button on James Bond, to the end that the schools not continued to be integrated in the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.460" offset="1425220">Their only remark that appear to be addressed specifically to the 25% of the crowd that was Negro, urged them to start taking reservations to Africa.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.154" offset="1472031">Since this remark appears to be among the more controversial in the record, it should be seen in its entirety and context.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.738" offset="1502333">The petitioner said in the course of that remark, “We don't need you, you're off, you're dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.473" offset="1529292">Get ready to leave this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.850" offset="1534725">You can leave in a lot of way.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.939" offset="1543084">You can leave on a boat, you can leave running.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.289" offset="1552488">You can bicycle or you can leave in a box.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.729" offset="1562311">This is a white man's country.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.507" offset="1569416">Princess Anne is a white man's town.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.820" offset="1578611">This is a white man's country.”</text>
            <text syncTime="370.760" offset="1586448">A witness testified that following this exhortation, both groups appeared interested.</text>

            <text syncTime="378.782" offset="1618526">Why don't you think the -- don't we have to accept that the thought of leaving in a box was a reference at least to violence and murder.</text>

          <turn speaker="eleanor_holmes_norton" startTime="386.876" stopTime="471.099">
            <label>Ms. Eleanor Holmes Norton</label>
            <text syncTime="386.876" offset="1650918">Yes it was indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.068" offset="1655620">It was a possible reference to their leaving in -- as a result of some sort of violent acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.907" offset="1682996">But isn't -- it is important to note that in advance of that exhortation of party officials had noted and this is earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.277" offset="1716433">This is before this comment that the party's official position about Negroes was an adoption of the position of Abraham Lincoln namely that this country should send Negroes back to Africa.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.995" offset="1779336">Moreover, the remark in question was not followed by any exhortations to the crowd to either start now or at some future date to seeing toward as Negroes leave in a box or even to seeing toward the Negroes leave in any other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.447" offset="1837119">Rather, immediately following this remark is a classic call to organize politically and nonviolently to wit.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.704" offset="1866167">Let's organize, let's hear a great human cry come up from the people and I guarantee you white folks out there to win every single political objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.673" offset="1902111">And a few sentences later, another of several calls was specifically nonviolent, political action to wit.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.938" offset="1931160">Bring your friends back out here tomorrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.035" offset="1939519">We want a shout to come out of this town, a nonviolent shout that every local politician is going to hear.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.642" offset="1965955">We want to McKelvin to hear it, Governor Talos to hear it, Congressman Morten and all the LBJ's.</text>

            <text syncTime="500.769" offset="2106493">There was specific testimony that relations between the raises in the town in advance of February '64 had been congenial and since that it had been congenial.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.397" offset="2148916">It was on the political prociendo of everyone coming back tomorrow and raising a non-violent shout to political leaders that the rally ended as the audience was invited to come up and take out $8.00 memberships into the National States Rights Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.731" offset="2222268">The use of the word nigger to denote Negro occurred throughout the rally but it provoked neither the Negroes present nor the whites.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.704" offset="2258213">In the first place, no one was specifically called a nigger.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.281" offset="2276498">One of the petitioners gave as a reason for the use of the word every time you call a nigger appellate person you are apologizing to them because they are black.</text>

            <text syncTime="879.748" offset="3622327">We've cited two other cases in our brief which we think point out the difference between moot claims and none moot claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.432" offset="3649076">One is oil workers where the Court found mootness to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.432" offset="3673109">The other is Motor Coach where the Court found no mootness to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.334" offset="3688678">In both cases, the Governor's seizure of a public utility was at issue and the Governor had returned the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.299" offset="3724518">The difference was that the underlying factual dispute was present in one case in Motor Coach and not present in the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.786" offset="3762552">That underlying factual dispute was a strike which ended in the one case and which continued in the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.309" offset="3792645">We think that the Sideburn case decided last term by this Court also points out a kind of exception this Court will -- it takes normal mootness claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.858" offset="3846771">There, it was pointed out that failures in state procedure will not be allowed as a course for mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.199" offset="3872162">Now, we think that there are specific failures of state procedure here which this Court in Freidman versus Maryland has already analyzed and condemned.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.271" offset="3908420">There this Court, looking at the censorship statute noted that there was no prompt way to get judicial review in the State of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.778" offset="3942484">It compared Maryland procedure with New York procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.449" offset="3957217">Under New York procedure, under Maryland procedure, it found that the statute talked about prompt administrative determination but it said that there was no assurance of prompt judicial review and this Court didn't really know how prompt administrative determination had to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.755" offset="4026389">In New York on the other hand, there is clear, definite language by the time limits as this Court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.728" offset="4054288">For example, a judge had to in New York hand down his opinion within two days after a matter was heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.067" offset="4087620">That kind of time limit saved the censorship statute in New York and didn't save censorship in Maryland and we submit that in this case, we have that kind situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.853" offset="4126804">Moreover, Walker versus Birmingham is procedurally relevant here, because the court there criticized petitioners for making no efforts to challenge the injunction there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.420" offset="4173093">And the court gave every indication that if petitioners had made efforts and if petitioners had met with delay, this Court would have decided the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.395" offset="4220949">Yet I believe that that case could not have gotten to this Court either before it became moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.686" offset="4246131">For the demonstration, it was hoped to be held on an Easter Sunday and the injunction was issued some two or three days before hand and even under available procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.220" offset="4288240">They could not have gotten here so I think there's an indication in the opinion that this Court would have decided that ex parte temporary injunction case because it related to free speech.</text>

            <text syncTime="1056.889" offset="4330977">I don't think the indication was that the case could have gotten here in time in the Walker against Birmingham but rather that if the petitioners have gone to the trial court in Alabama and had been met with a rebuff or a delay, and then had proceeded to hold their parade, the case would have been presented here ultimately in quite a different posture.</text>

            <text syncTime="1096.796" offset="4490533">It certainly is worth noting that this Court in Walker and Birmingham expressed considerable doubt as to the injunction and statute involved even though it didn't have to decide that question because it was a First Amendment case and it had an ex parte injunction in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.738" offset="4550301">We believe that these procedural and substantive reasons which are applicable to cases generally apply here, but we believe this case has another important part to and that is that now it's an ex parte injunction here in a First Amendment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.960" offset="4611218">And we believe that the supremacy clause means that this Court ought not let that ex parte injunction stand as law and rule of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.468" offset="4661269">Indeed, even when speech is not involved, equity will normally not enjoin the commission of a criminal act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1640.413" offset="6665070">I'll address my remarks specifically to some of the procedure to which Justice Fortas referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.370" offset="6696835">Were within the context actually of the Freidman case which we were urge a speedy determination from the lowest court to the Court of Appeals of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.104" offset="6755767">The ex parte injunction was issued of course on the affidavit of Commissioner D'Shield who the record discloses on -- did nationally observed the rally for more than five minutes time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.810" offset="6822640">Nor as the record indicated that the court actually hear the tape and the order of course continued for 10 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.175" offset="6856077">Now within that period of time -- oh, and this order, the ex parte order of the record indicates who was not served upon Stoner, Brailsford, and Norton nor the National States Rights Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.276" offset="6924518">It was however served on three of the petitioners so that actually there are three people who've never got, even got served as a process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.380" offset="6964851">Now ultimately when I got into the case on the 15th of August, I did file a general answer but of course the hearing was scheduled for the 17th which actually gave us only two days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.249" offset="7024410">Now under the Maryland rules of procedure, you do have two days within which to request a hearing for an ex parte order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.949" offset="7067146">However, in this particular case, we filed affidavits to the effect that the petitioners did attempt to contact two lawyers and failing that and also there's a letter in the record which I sent as soon I got into the case to the president of the Bar Association of Somerset County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.503" offset="7157426">Mr. Jones requesting that local counsel be assigned to assist us, because number one, the distance from Baltimore, Maryland from my office to Somerset County is 150 miles and it takes a day to get up and back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.375" offset="7216880">And secondly I wasn't altogether familiar with local practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.475" offset="7233285">Of course I got back a letter indicating that this was an unpopular cause and half of the Bar Association consisting of seven around the other side of the case and that in any event, nobody wanted the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.647" offset="7293994">Consequently, there wasn't any real remedy that these petitioners have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.256" offset="7320430">And we had a parole intents and purposes addressed ourselves to the permanent injunction and the hearing which of course came later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.584" offset="7361703">Now, in connection with our argument under Freidman that we would like a prompt and expedition to termination, I would suggest that even though technically the interlocutory or permit in injunction is not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.462" offset="7437249">From a practical standpoint, this injunction continued in effect from the date of its inception, the date of the ex parte order, which was on the 7th, until June the 7th, 1967 when the Court of Appeals finally rendered its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.268" offset="7520423">During the interim period, I would like this Court gone to stand that I made certainly every effort to number one, expedite the case according to the Maryland rules of procedure by initially trying to shorten the time for transmission of the record by filing a motion to shorten the time within which argument was to be held and even by sending a letter to the Court of Appeals of Maryland, which is part of the record requesting them to render an expeditious decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.670" offset="7654066">So from a practical standpoint, the defendants were enjoined for almost nine months, and I think that we would like the ruling to the effect that a determination of this kind involving speech and involving assembly should be handled in the same way that censorship cases are handled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.260" offset="7744449">That is that they should be able to get from the court of the lowest instance to the highest court in the state within the shortest period of time.</text>
