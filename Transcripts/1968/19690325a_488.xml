            <text syncTime="13.092" offset="155773">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. Yesterday, we were discussing the Nixon Farm which under the calls was improved and became a more of a place of business as we've observed from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.704" offset="222229">The -- with the advent of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Paul chose to operate their establishment under the guise of the private club as this evidence from the record here.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.444" offset="309164">This was rejected out of hand by the District Court and does not even a serious question in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.373" offset="348871">It does have one surprising effect of the case though that I think is followed it all the way through.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.694" offset="382098">If we look at the record in the commencement of the case, we see that it counsel for the plaintiff or for Mrs. Daniel and Mrs. Kyles intended the trial based upon the private club exception of the 1964 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.825" offset="462660">Now, this fell flat a gain in point in this regard, and that after, I think the record reflects at adequate proof was not brought in concerning the connection of this business with the commerce so that the Act apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.823" offset="546670">Now, the District Court in view that number one, that there was no coverage under the Act because this is not a place of entertainment.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.395" offset="620962">It considered it a place of participation or exercise or such as that and not one where the one is entertained.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.086" offset="659728">And it assumed that perhaps some of the items at the place of business had moved in interstate commerce.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="174.572" offset="801625">So, that is out of this case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_w_gallman" startTime="176.115" stopTime="480.978">
            <label>Mr. James W. Gallman</label>
            <text syncTime="176.115" offset="807790">I believe so.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.815" offset="822627">There was further the question of what connection the so-called lunch stand, snack bar or what have you here had this -- with the establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.846" offset="878738">That is would it be come under 201 (b) (4) or 201 (b) (2) restaurant and cafeteria and lunch counters sold about so, principally it gave in selling food for consumption on the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.721" offset="942268">The lower court felt that this business of swimming and sun bathing and so on, and that the food that was strictly incidental and not a major enterprise of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.611" offset="997857">It also rejected the idea that there were two establishments here and so as to say that under subsection 4 that there was no covered establishment that would rankly entire establishment for that the cover of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.373" offset="1072880">When this case got to the Court of Appeals, the reasoning was the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.902" offset="1095032">There, the Court of Appeals looked at the two requirements or coverage under the '64 Act, namely the commerce connection or the offer to serve interstate travelers.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.221" offset="1148217">Now again, I'd advert to the fact the record below was not developed with respect to the offer to sell/serve interstate travelers.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.346" offset="1188760">There simply no questioning about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.519" offset="1201403">It is true that it could be inferred from the testimony of Mr. Paul that they would serve any white person without inquiring about their origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.474" offset="1249259">But there is no searching inquiry at all as to whether they would restrict their service to dam sealers of the area, that is would leave the interstate traveler go elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.248" offset="1324387">This really is considering the geography of the matter, a remote and isolated lunch room if that's what we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.266" offset="1364407">It's some 12 miles from the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.968" offset="1379244">It's hard to get to as I explained yesterday hard to find.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.561" offset="1401605">The Court of Appeals then approached it from the standpoint of what did the record show with respect to commerce, and I know that Court had in mind just as the Assistant Attorney General have here that common sense wise, the business must have some connection with interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.404" offset="1476942">But are we dealing with the question of whether there is sufficient connection in the area for Congress to legislate?</text>
            <text syncTime="351.984" offset="1511320">Are we dealing with the question of whether under the provisions of the Act, a substantial part of the food served at the lunch room which it serves as moot in interstate commerce?</text>
            <text syncTime="365.966" offset="1567222">Now, there were four items mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.950" offset="1579133">Hamburgers, hotdogs, softdrinks, and milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.927" offset="1603062">It's argued by petitioners here that three of the four items had interstate arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.656" offset="1630020">There was no evidence about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.512" offset="1641409">The District Court without any evidentiary support at all said that he suppose that some of the ingredients for the hamburgers, I suppose the flour had interstate origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.290" offset="1712567">The drink I think he laid aside because of the legislative history of the Act indicating that it's the inquiry about the food, not about the drink.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.104" offset="1755826">He said that there's some of the ingredients obviously came from out of state I'm sure, as a matter of common knowledge, but it's not in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.606" offset="1805772">I'm satisfied or I feel my common sense tells me that this establishment sold cigarettes, that it sold candy, that it sold some other items, gum, mints, item such as these, but it's not in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.971" offset="1891244">As a matter of fact, the record indicates the absent.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.715" offset="1910262">So, I think this is what they get to when we look for coverage under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.921" offset="1923009">We find that it was thought of as a case where there would be a serious contest over private or public exemption, and then law and behold, that fell through.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.235" offset="1972328">And I've that the same experience myself that you think your case true, but did not go ahead and introduce a necessary evidence to show coverage under the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>

            <text syncTime="505.987" offset="2127287">But this place is always been noted for no alcoholic beverages of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.942" offset="2155186">So, the Court of Appeals approach is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.019" offset="2175457">Now, Judge Henny does dissented in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.128" offset="2191862">He was quite so sure that Judge Mahaphy, the majority judge, was wrong about this lack of evidence concerning movement of the food in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.435" offset="2249122">He wanted to look at some Arkansas statutes that permitted or might be use to prevent so-called integration or admissions of Negroes to the so-called place.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.934" offset="2323101">As saying well, there is an ominous enforcement act in Arkansas that might be use to prevent this sort of thing so we can say that this practice, this discriminatory practice of the falls resulted from state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.483" offset="2401259">So, he but his disagreement only with this conclusion and contended of course all the while that there was sufficient evidence that interstate commerce had furnished the so-called lunch room.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.927" offset="2487045">Now, the other question I think it deserves comment here is the question of what about this place of entertainment?</text>
            <text syncTime="608.339" offset="2536678">Basically, this is a participant type amusement park, if we could call it that.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.270" offset="2568443">I'd rather call it the farm but the record doesn't reflect that.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.032" offset="2591535">But it doesn't have rights, it doesn't have the things that you had in the Fifth Circuit case of milk, where you have 11 or 12 complicated rights manufactured out of state and brought in without any question.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.267" offset="2656423">Here, our record concerning the equipment used for boating and boating only that the evidence do is not clear is to where that came from.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.407" offset="2708982">Now, there is some indication that they have about a dozen boats that called puddle boats.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.126" offset="2735835">I don't know what they are exactly, except I think of a kind where children get only have some wheels, some pedals, they push and the puddle in the rear of the boat makes it go.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.143" offset="2787976">Now, I think that's what it is and I'm not sure they have yatch whatever that is.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.403" offset="2812949">Now, this is a very minor part of the activities as I understand the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.438" offset="2833115">It suggested that these where perhaps purchased out of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.770" offset="2850461">Judge Mahaphy in his opinion said that it was common knowledge, boats was made in Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.458" offset="2873240">There was a reference to an Oklahoma boat company to whom the Paul's paid a royalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.526" offset="2921514">But it is not clear whether if one ends in -- at one point, the question is from whom did you purchase the boats or did you purchase a yatch?</text>
            <text syncTime="717.697" offset="2974177">They say the same company, meaning the same company to whom the pay the royalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.109" offset="2991835">But there's not testimony about rather boats was made, where the sale was made, where the boat came from, did it come from Oklahoma and Arkansas, there's nothing about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.631" offset="3037915">Now, assume that the briefs that this indicate some interstate contact with reference to that and for that reason, we ought to say that the entertainment here, these boats, move in commerce, and that therefore, this activity ought to be a covered under subsubsection 4 of the Act of two or one of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.756" offset="3138435">We suggest that it's not anywhere near like the Miller case that Judge Mahaphy in his opinion was correct that the evidence concerning movement with reference to amusement and entertainment movement in interstate commerce is not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.414" offset="3204995">Now, the Court of Appeals did not have authority and has not have a possibility of drilling on the applicability of the Title 42 Section 1981 and 1982.</text>

            <text syncTime="1407.251" offset="5732394">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.366" offset="5744828">With reference to Mr. Gallman's last point concerning the disposition of the Lake Nixon property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.295" offset="5768547">Rumor came to our attention sometime in December after this Court had granted certiorari that the property had been disposed of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.599" offset="5797804">Where upon I call the former attorney for the Paul, Mr. Robinson, I believe his name was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.593" offset="5825703">He indicated he was not then their attorney, he's understanding was that they did not wish to pursue this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.331" offset="5848691">However, he recommended and since he didn't know anything more, I might talk with Mrs. Paul and Mr. Paul.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.138" offset="5871888">So, I took this extraordinary step of calling Mrs. Paul directly and asked her whether she had in fact disposed of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.828" offset="5898637">Her answer was “no”, that the thought it was under contract but the deal had not been consummated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.366" offset="5920789">And that is as much of I know and that was of as of late December, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.389" offset="5948897">With reference to the other principal question, I'd like address myself to now, that is the food that was served at Lake Nixon.</text>

            <text syncTime="1477.695" offset="6014203">I think it is sufficient for this Court if it wishes to undertake to look at this case the way it look to the case as Hamm versus Rock Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.004" offset="6047431">There, there was no evidence as to the origin of the food involved and yet, this Court in a divided opinion or a divided court undertook to say that the facilities in Hamm as well as a companion case where in fact opened to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.116" offset="6111796">They were located neither or five and dime in South Carolina or department store in Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.194" offset="6136142">And that was sufficient that court felt to demonstrate that in the ordinary course interstate connections could be shown as to the origin of the food.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.208" offset="6172191">We think that situation is particularly at here because the District Court seating at Little Rock very close to Lake Nixon undertook to say that as far as he was concerned, there was sufficient -- a connection with interstate commerce to demonstrate that some of the food at least had originated outside the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.631" offset="6249932">Therefore, our position of course is the case is not moot and the complaint I might mention inclusion, those run against successors in addition to the Paul's, who believe that might get situation here.</text>
