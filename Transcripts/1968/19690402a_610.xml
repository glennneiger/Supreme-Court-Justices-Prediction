            <label>Mr. F. Michael Ahern</label>
            <text syncTime="21.090" offset="187747">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.185" offset="204152">This appeal has been taken by State of Connecticut from a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, affirming a lower court ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.825" offset="246680">That ruling held that the application of sales and use taxes to the purchase and use of property by non-resident servicemen in Connecticut to be in contravention of Section 514 of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.200" offset="316165">This case was instituted by an able lieutenant named Schuman, and the United States of America in the District Court for the District of Connecticut, claiming immunity from the application of the tax to a boat, a pleasure boat purchased by Lieutenant Schuman in Connecticut, on the basis that Section 514 of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Relief Act granted that immunity from sales taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.667" offset="430059">The District Court dismissed the claim of Schuman for lack of jurisdiction from which no appeal has been taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.654" offset="462033">It granted summary judgment to the United States which judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals on July 10, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.692" offset="498186">Notice of intent to appeal was filed July 30th, the case was docketed on October 7th and this Court noted probable jurisdiction on January 13, 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.831" offset="546670">The jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. 1254 subsection (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="117.277" offset="572479">I should like to state at this time that the State of Texas has filed an amicus brief in which 30 other states have joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.212" offset="604244">The State of New York and the State of California had each filed independent amicus briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.031" offset="627545">Illinois has joined California in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.099" offset="643741">We commend these briefs to the Court, and thank the States for their interests and efforts on our behalf, and at the same time, I should like to commend to the Court the second part of the brief of the appellee in this case, the United States of America, starting at page 37 through 43, which does not subscribe to the arguments which are represented in the first part of the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.333" offset="740707">The issues in this case are whether the lower court heard in determining that Section 514 of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act prohibits the application of sales and use taxes to the private purchase transactions of servicemen stationed in the States throughout the country under military orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.093" offset="827747">And further, whether Section 514 as interpreted by the Court of Appeals is an unconstitutional infringement on the reserved powers of the States to tax, under Article X of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.772" offset="890441">The facts in this case of brief, the parties to the action stipulated that the everyday purchases of tangible personal property by servicemen, are made at PXs on military installations and are therefore not subject to taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.130" offset="947911">So they are not a part of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.800" offset="958568">This case is involved with purchases of larger items by servicemen such as pleasure boats, cars, television sets and so forth which they can not get at PXs.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.965" offset="1019277">In the lower court, the District Court, the United States Government presented several affidavits which allegedly set forth facts illustrative of the situations in which the State of Connecticut was assessing sales or use taxes against servicemen in Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.853" offset="1090748">I should like to address myself to one of those affidavits at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.191" offset="1108093">It's the affidavit of Commander William Foster which is printed in the record appendix at page 21 (a) through 27 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="260.947" offset="1147173">Commander Foster was a Texas domiciliary stationed in Connecticut who purchased a car from a Connecticut retail dealer and paid the tax thereon.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.941" offset="1187088">Commander Foster in his affidavit claims to have paid a use tax on the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.204" offset="1212165">That statement is in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.568" offset="1221674">At page 6 and at page 23 of the Government brief -- Government's brief, it refers to the Commander Foster affidavit, and on each instance it states that Commander Foster paid a use tax to the State of Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.872" offset="1274859">These statements are in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.236" offset="1284368">The purchase by Commander Foster was from a Connecticut retail dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.160" offset="1300041">The sale took place within the State and he paid his sales tax to the dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.171" offset="1320103">I direct the Court's attention to page 27 (a) of the record appendix on which it reproduced the invoice covering the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.826" offset="1350719">And on the invoice, it very plainly states sales taxes were paid to the dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.255" offset="1384364">And significantly, at page 41 of the Government's brief, and this is in the second part which doesn't agree with the first part, a reference is made to this affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.658" offset="1426056">And the reference is that Commander Foster paid a sales tax to the State of Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.317" offset="1456671">In this connection also, my friends from the Attorney General's office in the State of Texas tell me that I've committed a grievous error in my brief at page 6, wherein I refer to Commander Foster's affidavit and state that after paying sales tax to the State of Connecticut, Commander Foster was required to pay a use tax to the State of Texas before registering the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.408" offset="1544965">The Attorney General's office in Texas advises me that since 1961, Texas has had a reciprocity provision in its statutes granting credit for any sales or use taxes paid to another jurisdiction on a motor vehicle which is brought into Connecticut or into Texas for use therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.345" offset="1620720">I would ask this Court to take judicial notice of the laws of the State of Texas in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.748" offset="1654366">One final reference to the Foster affidavit, in the lower court, when the motion for summary judgment was heard, the Government presented three affidavits to the court for its consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.466" offset="1717269">One of these was the affidavit of Commander Foster.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.221" offset="1732211">At that time, I filed a motion to strike the affidavit from the record on the basis that Commander Foster had arrived at the misapprehension that he had paid a use tax, rather than a sales tax to the retail dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.369" offset="1784874">The District Court noted my objection, but did not rule on that objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.601" offset="1809742">Under the circumstances, I renew that objection at this time, and claim that the court erred and not ruling on the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.748" offset="1842343">And I would ask that this Court disregard the Foster affidavit and its deliberations.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.344" offset="1876720">I would like to emphasize to this Court that this is a case of first impression before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.771" offset="1902425">In the last 25 years, since the 1944 Amendment to the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act, no claim has been advanced that Section 514 encompassed sales and use taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.377" offset="1968880">It wasn't until April of 1967 when this case was filed in the District Court for the District of Connecticut that the claim was made that Section 514 encompassed sales and use taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.747" offset="2022379">So that this is the first opportunity any court has had to consider the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.522" offset="2053413">It is the position of the State of Connecticut that Section 514 was designed and intended by Congress to grant immunity to servicemen from property taxes, income taxes and certain annual motor vehicle taxes in any state but its home state -- his home state.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.547" offset="2137527">The statute accomplishes this by removing the jurisdictional grounds for the imposition of those taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.508" offset="2157380">That is residence, domicile, and situs of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.770" offset="2182457">The legislative history of Section 514 and the 1944 Amendment and the 1962 Amendment thereto supports this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.530" offset="2229478">In the legislative history of this Section and the clarifying amendments, and that's what they were characterized at the time they were proposed to Congress as clarifying Amendments, not a broadening of the tax immunity already granted by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.681" offset="2294053">The committee hearings and the reports of committees contain not one single reference to sales and use taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.784" offset="2334490">However, those committee hearings and the reports are replete with references to income and property taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.707" offset="2362180">We submit to the Court that the silence of the committee hearings and the silence of Congress as to sales and use taxes is indicative of the intention Congress in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.217" offset="2428217">It might be pointed out too to the Court that in 1940, the Buck Act was passed which specifically granted the States the rights to collect sales and use taxes on transactions taking place on federal enclaves.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.279" offset="2480462">So that Congress was well aware of the sales and use tax phase of taxation at the time it passed Section 514 and its Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.160" offset="2531976">It is interesting to know that the District of Columbia which is governed by a sub-committee of Congress, I understand, has had a sales and use tax on its books since 1949, at a period of about 20 years and just two years less than the State of Connecticut has had its tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.727" offset="2602297">The Government in the lower court and in its argument and in this Court is strangely silent as to the position taken by the taxing officials of the District of Columbia in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.844" offset="2650781">Now, certainly if any taxing officials in the United States should be aware of the intention of Congress and the mood of Congress, it would be the taxing officials of the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.292" offset="2696547">I think from the silence in this regard, we can infer that the District of Columbia does not grant tax immunity on sales and use taxes on the purchases of servicemen in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.898" offset="2750986">We submit that the lower court erred when it equated a sales tax to a property tax in its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.432" offset="2785050">The only reason for equating it to a property tax was that the ultimate burden of the tax ultimately fell on the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.711" offset="2822248">We submit that this is true of almost any tax that the ultimate burden will fall on the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.916" offset="2843042">That is hardly a reason for equating two distinct types of taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.900" offset="2866970">The Court of Appeals compounded this error by following the same reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.723" offset="2890271">We submit to this Court that a sales tax is not a property tax, and conversely a property tax is not a sales tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.556" offset="2921618">A property tax difference from a sales tax and that it is a recurrent annual demand based on capital value of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.417" offset="2957040">Whereas a sales tax is based on the purchase price or the -- it's based on the cost of acquisition or the purchase price of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.287" offset="3000508">And it is only taxed one time at the date of acquisition of that property.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.823" offset="3026631">A property tax is an ad valorem tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.231" offset="3036348">And in 51 American jurisprudence at page 53, which is not in my brief, Section 26 it states it very succinctly and I'd like to read or quote for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.103" offset="3083786">“An ad valorem tax is a tax on a fixed proportion of the value of property with respect to which the tax is assessed and requires the intervention of assessors or appraisers to estimate the value of such property before the amount due from each taxpayer may be determined.”</text>
            <text syncTime="764.563" offset="3161631">To that definition must be added that the statutes provide a means of appeal from the assessed valuation placed on property by an assessor to a board of tax review and ultimately to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.520" offset="3213458">So that an owner of property being assessed by a tax assessor has recourse to a board of tax review and the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.241" offset="3256299">The appellee concedes the difference between a property tax and a sales tax in his brief at page 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.087" offset="3283675">But he argues that such difference should not be of real consequence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.367" offset="3300812">We strongly disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.540" offset="3309484">At page 14 of its brief also, it claims that Congress intended that the tax exemption should be applied to any tax which is measured by the value of property, and in the sales tax area, the value is the purchase price.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.327" offset="3372701">With this we must also strongly disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.618" offset="3397883">The value in taxation or the word value in taxation is peculiarly applicable to personal property taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.548" offset="3433514">It does not have the same meaning as purchase price in sales taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.703" offset="3454203">As stated earlier, an ad valorem taxation of property, a value is placed on property by an assessor who is usually a public official before the tax is levied.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.702" offset="3502164">And the owner of the property has the right of appeal to the board of tax review or to the courts for relief from the amount of the assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.454" offset="3537168">In the sales and use tax area, the tax is based on the purchased price of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.573" offset="3561618">The purchase price is set at the whim of the retailer, and if the purchaser wants the property, he pays the purchase price without recourse to anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.135" offset="3603937">If I may give a concrete example of the two taxes, I would suggest that we let represent or let represent two neighbors in a given community and label them A and B. Each owns the same model and year automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.192" offset="3668093">For local property tax purposes the tax assessor places A's automobile on the tax list at the value of $2,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.379" offset="3700903">He places B's car on the list at $4,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.323" offset="3716681">In this case, B has recourse to the board of tax review and the courts to have his valuation of $4,000.00 reduced to equalize his pays with A.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.562" offset="3765582">In the same manner, when A and B acquired these vehicles, A very well might have had connections in the automotive field which allowed him to buy the automobile at the wholesale price of $3,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.478" offset="3825246">The sales tax would apply to the purchase price of $3,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.425" offset="3845099">In the same manner, B who didn't have the same connections might have to pay the full retail price of $5,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.941" offset="3875088">In this case, the sales tax would be applied to the $5,000.00 figure and neither B nor A could complain about the price.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.759" offset="3910405">The tax is on the actual purchase price of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.359" offset="3932766">We should submit that the Court should give short shift to the arguments of the Government in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.881" offset="3958888">The Government in its brief, places great emphasis on the two leading cases under Section 514 of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act, which were decided by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.606" offset="4017821">They are Dameron versus Brodhead, California versus Buzard.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.923" offset="4031091">Both of which are cited in all of the briefs submitted to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.108" offset="4051780">We submit however, than rather than support the Government's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.213" offset="4068185">These cases support the State's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.278" offset="4080515">For example, in Dameron versus Brodhead which involved an ad valorem property tax on the property of a serviceman serving in Colorado, he was a Louisiana resident at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.557" offset="4137566">This Court in striking down the ad valorem property tax stated “In fact though the evils of potential” -- and I quote, excuse me, from page 326 of the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.088" offset="4187721">“In fact, though the evils of multiple taxation, may have given rise to this provision, Congress appears to have chosen the broader technique of the statute carefully freeing servicemen from both income and property taxes imposed by any State by virtue of their presence there as a result of military orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.105" offset="4259819">It saved the sole right of taxation to the state of original residence whether or not that State exercise the right.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.340" offset="4292733">Again, in California versus Buzard, in which the issue was the arrest, prosecution and conviction of Captain Buzard for driving an unregistered motor vehicle on the highways of California, this Court at page 387 opened its decision with the following paragraph and I quote again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.653" offset="4381968">“Section 514 of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, 56.777 as amended, provides a nonresident serviceman present in the State in compliance with military orders with a broad immunity from that State's personal property and income taxation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.232" offset="4456260">The 2% license fee which was involved in the Buzard case was a substitute for an ad valorem property tax which California had found difficult to administer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.677" offset="4490115">So then, both the Dameron case, which involved an ad valorem property tax, and in the Buzard case which involved a 2% license fee as substitute for an ad valorem tax, this Court emphasized that it was dealing with an immunity granted by Congress from income and property taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.732" offset="4566288">Again at page 393 of the Buzard decision, this Court states and I quote, “The very purpose of 514 -- Section 514 in broadly frame a nonresident serviceman from the obligation to pay property and income taxes, was to relieve him of the burden of supporting the Governments of the States where he was present solely in compliance with military orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.052" offset="4659597">The statute operates whether or not the home state imposes or assesses such taxes against him.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.283" offset="4680495">Again, the reference is to property taxes and income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.356" offset="4716753">The court, pardon me, the appellee in his brief places great emphasis on this reference to the Buzard case, the latter statement concerning income and property taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.779" offset="4774536">He quotes it at pages 12, 19 and 26 of the first part of its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.781" offset="4798464">However, he very conveniently or it very conveniently leaves out the reference to income and property taxation so that the out-of-context phrase that is quoted by the Government at the top of page 12 is, and I quote “the very purpose of Section 514 ***, was to relieve *** to servicemen of the burden of supporting the Governments of the States where he was present solely in compliance with military orders.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.526" offset="4905462">The three asterisks denote the deletion of the reference to income and property taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.242" offset="4928345">At pages 19 and 26, the same out-of-context quote is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.741" offset="4954363">However, it is extremely interesting to note that at page 39 of the brief, which is the second part, which does not subscribe to the arguments in the first part, a further reference is made to the case of California versus Buzard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.308" offset="5012564">And in this case, the quotation is given in full, so that the proper context of the quotation is given referring to income and property taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.210" offset="5068257">In any event, we submit that the two cases leave no doubt that the opinion of this Court the immunity granted by Congress was for property and income taxes, and not sales and use taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.121" offset="5139832">At page 37 of its brief, in note 27, the appellee advances a novel argument that servicemen who are on furlough are no longer absent from their home state by virtue of military orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.748" offset="5194376">In effect, this means that a Texas serviceman stationed in Connecticut who was given a three-day pass, as soon as he is given the three-day pass his status immediately changes so that he becomes subject to sales and use taxes in Connecticut and in any other State that he might visit on his furlough under the decision of our lower court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.636" offset="5289880">At the end of his furlough, the mantle of tax immunity immediately falls on his shoulders, and he again becomes immune from sales and use taxes until he obtains his next furlough from his commanding officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.020" offset="5343483">This, we submit is adding confusion to an already confusing situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.786" offset="5366471">The effect of the lower court decision as we view it is to foster a discriminatory situation which we claim is itself unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.968" offset="5411192">For example, California at page 2 of its amicus brief states that there are 345,000 servicemen stationed at the various bases in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.016" offset="5451421">Of that number, 45,000 of the servicemen are California residents, 300,000 are nonresidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.672" offset="5482036">Yet, in the purchase of tangible personal property, anywhere in California, the 45,000 resident servicemen are required to pay sales and use taxes, while the 300,000 nonresident servicemen purchasing the same items for their personal use are not obliged to pay sales and use taxes under the rationale of the above decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.551" offset="5557582">We submit that this is built-in discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1415.778" offset="5766457">The appellee in this case attempts to minimize the difficulties which might arise if the lower court decision is not reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.650" offset="5805955">We submit that the fact that 34 other states have joined Connecticut in support of its position in this case is overwhelming evidence of the seriousness of this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.704" offset="5842213">Certainly, the tax administrators and the attorneys general of these 34 states are competent to determine the effects of the decision on tax revenues and tax administration in the various states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.143" offset="5899995">The main thrust of appellee's argument is to the effect that the addition of just four words after the words “personal property” in Section 514 that is “for the use thereof”, clearly shows an intention on the part of Congress to exempt servicemen or grant immunity to servicemen from both the whole scheme of sales and use taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.463" offset="5985259">We submit that this is not a proper application of the, pardon me, this is not a proper subscription to Congress in view of the fact that it's been silent as to this intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.567" offset="6049625">To accommodate the appellee, all Congress had to do was to say that a serviceman was immune from all taxation in any state but his home state, except taxation as to real property and the operation of a business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.660" offset="6101974">But this Congress did not choose to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.077" offset="6111692">And we submit that if any changes to be made in this sensitive area that this Court let Congress make the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.780" offset="6146487">Connecticut and its officials are not unmindful of the sacrifices and services being rendered by our servicemen both home and abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.489" offset="6177311">And if the burden of taxation is so great that it warrants relief, then we submit they should receive it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.916" offset="6203016">However, we feel that Congress should give them affirmative relief in the form of a pay increase or exemption from federal income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.063" offset="6243662">Not by seeking to have this Court, by judicial fiat and using inferences and implications, expand the provisions of Section 514 to encompass sales and use taxes when this was not the congressional intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3115.434" offset="12565086">I think that the -- I'd like to turn first if I may to the discussion of Commander Foster's case by Mr. Ahern, because I think that what happened to Commander Foster may best illustrate why Section 514 was adopted and why the courts below were correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.993" offset="12655365">Commander Foster bought a car in Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.596" offset="12669785">He lived -- he was a domiciliary of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.513" offset="12689429">He wanted to register his car in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.699" offset="12706147">He wrote to Texas and he was told that to register there, he had to pay a Texas sales tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.800" offset="12734568">The dealer in Connecticut told him he nevertheless had to pay a Connecticut tax to get his car.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.854" offset="12770826">His affidavit states that he called the Department of Motor Vehicles in Connecticut, and was told that there was no credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.214" offset="12800188">He had to pay what, he says, was -- he was told to the -- a Connecticut use tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.544" offset="12825579">To get his car and to register it in his home state in Texas, he paid the Texas tax and both Connecticut tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.490" offset="12865285">And it isn't until this Court in Mr. Ahern's argument here that he has been told that he didn't have to pay both taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.626" offset="12897886">Now, we suggest that Section 514 was intended to avoid this kind of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.026" offset="12923486">That it was intended to create a situation where the only jurisdiction which could tax servicemen in this position would be his home state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.107" offset="12971760">514 was added to the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act in 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.271" offset="12996420">It was -- the language that we are interested in here was added in 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.056" offset="13031633">I would suggest the basic problem is whether the language or the policy or the basis for this -- of the statute in any way allow a distinction to be drawn between ad valorem taxation, annual ad valorem taxation, which everybody agrees is forbidden by the statute and sales and use tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.939" offset="13123166">The starting place, I would suggest, should be the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.683" offset="13146154">It refers in its terms to what is called “taxation in respect of personal property”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.560" offset="13181576">Now this is what seemed to be the broadest possible language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.511" offset="13205400">It is not ad valorem taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.424" offset="13213027">It is not seemingly restricted to anyone's specific type of taxation, but taxation in respect to personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.475" offset="13245315">This would seem to catch any tax that has to do with personal property that depends or is triggered by the existence of personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.515" offset="13285439">And any such tax under Section 514 is supposed to be forbidden except when imposed or exacted by the servicemen state of residence or domicile.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.973" offset="13327235">In the way that the -- this mechanism works is to create what might be called a fictional location of the servicemen's personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.272" offset="13372479">The personal property is deemed not to be in any state where he appears and is not a resident or a domiciliary, and any state where he's taken solely by his military orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.794" offset="13426500">I don't think that anyone has suggested exactly how this phrase can be read in a way that would set -- describe only ad valorem taxes, but would not describe sales or use taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.616" offset="13485850">I think this is particularly clear with use taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.368" offset="13504867">Use taxes require the physical presence of property within a taxing jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.973" offset="13535274">It can be imposed only when property is used in the jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.192" offset="13552097">And that occurs -- that can not occur in the case of a nonresident serviceman because of Section 514.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.486" offset="13589295">His property can never be deemed to be in a jurisdiction other than his home state for purposes of local taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.137" offset="13631927">This is also true I think, of sales taxes and if Connecticut statute, which I think is typical, it doesn't just as they say tax the privilege of a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.522" offset="13677484">It -- the tax comes into being only when there is a sale of personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.351" offset="13700786">Personal and furthermore, it only happens when the possession of this personal property is taken in Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.211" offset="13732237">Under Section 514 that possession is got to be considered as taking place in the serviceman's home state.</text>

            <text syncTime="3455.935" offset="13927111">A person -- a personal property, meaning personal property of the nonresident serviceman shall not be deemed to be located or present in or to have a situs for taxation in such state and so forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="3491.491" offset="14069321">This purpose of the statute as expressed by Congress and by this Court was to avoid any real threat, any possibility of double taxation by multiple jurisdictions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3517.003" offset="14171408">Rather, the purpose of the statute was to leave the sole function of the tax, the sole ability to tax to the home state, to the serviceman's residence or domicile.</text>

            <text syncTime="3537.152" offset="14251969">I think Justice Harlan the risk of double taxation comes out of a complimentary function of the sales and use taxations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.652" offset="14277987">As the two courts below said, they're not really separate taxes, they're merged into one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.035" offset="14299512">The use taxes in so much as a matter of raising revenue by itself, but it's a complement in a means of enforcing the sales tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.026" offset="14331486">And I would suggest that this is double taxation when a sale -- serviceman buys a car in one state and is charged a sales tax and he goes to the other -- another state where he is then charged a use tax, which use tax would not have been imposed if he had originally bought the car in the second state and paid a sales tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="3598.247" offset="14496371">The other thing which comes to the potential of double taxation which is also within the purposes of this statute is that ultimately, we would -- I'd assume the serviceman is going home.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.341" offset="14556766">And when he goes home he brings back his property with him whatever he's acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.631" offset="14573902">And at that time, he is going to be subjected to a use tax on this property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.556" offset="14593546">And this is the point in time when double taxation is almost certain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.316" offset="14612668">I suggest really in terms of potential for double taxation, this ought to be compared to the structure of the ad valorem taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.587" offset="14649762">Ad valorem taxation isn't going to be doubly imposed anymore frequently than the use tax or in sales tax structures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.681" offset="14682049">It would really depend on the accident of a man being switched from jurisdiction to jurisdiction within one year being in one state on its ad valorem tax day, and then in another state later in the year or earlier on its ad valorem tax day.</text>

            <text syncTime="4350.025" offset="17503483">I've looked at this Arlington case, apparently this is the rationale of the Government standing to bring this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4356.969" offset="17531277">I'm quoting from it, “Here we find that the interest of the national government in the proper implementation of its policies and programs involving the national defense is such as divest in it the non-statutory right to maintain this action.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4373.793" offset="17598568">Under these circumstances, the incapacity of the individual plaintiff to maintain his action is immaterial since he may find shelter under the Government's umbrella.</text>
            <text syncTime="4383.728" offset="17638275">Now my question is, I gather the policies and programs of the United States when this action was brought were on the side of the servicemen, and that would be the justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="4396.189" offset="17688116">And the defense in issue of the right of the Government to maintain the suit had been raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="4402.636" offset="17713925">But now here we come to -- when you come to this Court, apparently the Government's policies and programs have changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4409.409" offset="17740988">Does that have a bearing on whether or not we have a case of controversy before us?</text>

            <text syncTime="4415.458" offset="17765230">I would think that the existence of the controversy -- again I would like to go back to the confession situation, because in the confession situation the Government is clearly saying now, we don't think now that in a criminal case this man could've been prosecuted or should've been prosecuted in this way.</text>
