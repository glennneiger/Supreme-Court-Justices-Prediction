            <text syncTime="3.296" offset="116590">This is the Drummer case, this was just different.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.042" offset="127561">The Drummer case is the states have sought to license the solicitation of orders in the state out of this series of events.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.733" offset="162356">This Court has unanimously so far as I recall held that you cannot split them up into solicitation and put the tax on that -- where there is this interstate activity throughout.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="27.867" offset="214810">Well it seems to me that the complicating factor here is that this could be regarded as a J.C. Penny operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.768" offset="258487">J.C. Penny rounds up the children and does the selling and delivers the photographs after their maid, as I recall the facts here.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="58.154" offset="336018">And then you have these out of state photographers who come in and expose film and send the film out of state to be developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.479" offset="381262">And they the film, then the photographs are sent back to J.C. Penny, so you have them.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.656" offset="406026">Situation here that is a little complicated in the intermingling of intra and interstate aspects a little more than mingling than some of the others on that book.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Edward Thornton</label>
            <text syncTime="88.358" offset="456808">That’s true.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.547" offset="461511">Now of course, response number one, this case doesn’t involve J.C. Penny as the court is aware, the assessment was made against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.656" offset="497977">And in the appendix it’s pretty clear that the state was very anxious to see to it that no agency was developed between Penny and tax payer and this is true, there isn’t any agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.683" offset="546147">But this is a slightly different case than the Drummer case as you say where he has no claim.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="117.887" offset="574882">Well the tax is not imposed on J.C. Penny, but the facts inevitably and inescapably involve J.C. Penny.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Edward Thornton</label>
            <text syncTime="127.243" offset="612394">Well, maybe Your Honor recalls the city case, which is before this Court and we went off on that point there and we don’t think we should have gone off on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.951" offset="659205">But nevertheless, there they insisted that my suit for declaratory judgment to hold up this, fifty dollar a day license, which of course this is destructive.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.666" offset="694000">I mean this stands we are gone, we can’t sell it up for $0.59 maybe pictures to make that kind of a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.076" offset="727646">But there, after we got to court they met us by saying well you’re the wrong person and we said, no, you tried to put in jail and we are the ones that’s interested, we are the ones that’s going to pay it and this is not the J.C. Penny, it’s not quite like a leased section of a department store, where there, you know the department store will get an overall catch all license and then they will lease out various parts of the departments to.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.267" offset="840391">But we are not quite that, we come and go, we come and go at Penny’s.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Edward Thornton</label>
            <text syncTime="192.765" offset="874454">Well somewhat, yes that’s true, but now I would like to emphasize one thing, we deliberately do business this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.662" offset="902040">That is to say we want a local business where a disgruntle customer or anyone like that has someone to go to.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.406" offset="941014">We are not unaware of the fact that there has been criticism of transient photographers, just as there has been criticism of transient operators of any kind, where a man spends his money and can protect himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.412" offset="993050">So we are very proud of our product, we think we have a good baby picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.505" offset="1013426">But we want the customer to know that he’s got someone with this sort of reputation that J.C. Penny has, that he can come to see about us and this is, we deliberately encourage that but we want to, because we think that’s good.</text>

            <text syncTime="257.060" offset="1131604">Suppose they were simply taxing, imposing a tax on the part of the activity done in Alabama, would your argument be the same?</text>
            <text syncTime="267.462" offset="1173191">Are you claiming that here they are actually licensing interstate commerce by putting the tax on the whole thing?</text>

            <text syncTime="450.559" offset="1905560">Well, this of course is the plot we want most of all, but if I may on page 27 of the brief, the reason they held The Supreme Court of Alabama held, the reason they held that we were subject to a transient or itinerant license, was because it says this, true in the branch operation, this had to do with Olan Mills case, page 27, there is a fixed location. But it sends its film back to Chattanooga to be processed and the pictures are ultimately made in Chattanooga.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.274" offset="2036485">Now on this basis you see it was because of this interstate activity that the transient or the $5 a week license is imposed rather than the $25 a year license.</text>

            <label>Mr. William H. Burton</label>
            <text syncTime="529.477" offset="2221328">Gentlemen, in biased instanced here, it seems that the appellant rather accuses the State of Alabama and the City of Mobile of entering into some kind of evil conspiracy to put this company out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.405" offset="2317040">But actually the tax levied by the state has nothing whatsoever to do with the tax levied by the city, they are two separate and distinct entities and there is no evidence in the record that there was any kind of collusion or conspiracy here between the state and the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.760" offset="2426441">Now as any if there, where there is a confusion it is in this field of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.367" offset="2468864">And as I read the cases, if there is one universal principle that applies to all cases it is that each case stands on its own shoes, on its own facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.703" offset="2542216">Now this particular case, not in this case but in similar cases where the state has assessed this licensed action, against photographers operating for Olan Mills, the Supreme Court of Alabama on not one, but on three occasions has held that this tax is directed at the photographer and the individual photographer.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.655" offset="2689964">That is a person who comes in and takes the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.512" offset="2705429">Now we disagree with counsel for the appellant that the Court has said that it’s now sending the films out of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.701" offset="2746180">If that were true, I wouldn’t be here arguing the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.400" offset="2764988">But what the Supreme Court of Alabama has held in defining the characteristics of this tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.849" offset="2802813">And its authoritative meaning is that it’s directed at the individual photographer and on his activities in the state more or less conducting the setting and taking the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.292" offset="2872508">And if you read the license, it says, actually this license is levied under title 51 that’s the revenue code of the state, section 569.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.383" offset="2940949">Now the first part of the statute relates to fixed locations or photography gallery.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.726" offset="2978252">Then there is a last sentence there which levies a separate and distinct license on transit or travelling photographers.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.002" offset="3027362">And actually it reads as follows, for each transit or travelling photographer $5 a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.970" offset="3075218">Now in the case of Graves versus Alabama, that was the case involving one of Olan Mills photographs and it was a criminal case in the circuit court and in that case when it got to the Supreme Court of Alabama, the court held that the license was directed at the photographer as the statute says each travelling or transit photographer $5 a week.</text>

            <text syncTime="1589.079" offset="6459643">Now there is also a case by the Supreme Court of Alabama, when the case was sent back, the Supreme Court of Alabama actually defined the characteristics of the tax and it held that that tax was a local tax, although United Gas Pipeline Company was engaged in transporting gas in interstate commerce, that was their business and selling it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.867" offset="6566849">But they held that this license levied by the City of Mobile on the selling of natural gas in Mobile was a local license.</text>

            <text syncTime="1638.362" offset="6656815">Also another case that we rely strongly on is the Caskey Baking case, whereby license was levied on bakeries, I believe those selling bread to people, retailers, licensed retailers in the State of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.601" offset="6757752">And the bread was baked in West Virginia and transported over the state land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.555" offset="6789622">It’s more or less one of the Peddler cases but this court held that license tax directed at that local activity of selling the bread and delivering it half of their trucks was sufficient while the license tax validly attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.696" offset="6910203">Another point in the Graves decision, the Supreme Court of Alabama has held that inherently this tax does not discriminate because it applies equally to all transit photographers, whether they come within or without the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.849" offset="7002781">And clearly this type of operation for the appellant relies mainly on the Drummer cases and I suppose the leading case in that line is Nippert versus Richmond but there the license was levied on solicitations and the orders was sent to Washington I believe the Nippert represented a Washington garment manufacturing company and the court held that the solicitations were clearly in interstate commerce and that license could not be valid or levied in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2131.720" offset="8630209">Now when the photographer came through, they arrested him for not having a transient photographer’s license.</text>

            <text syncTime="2149.432" offset="8701053">It being so essential, a part of the photography business that a license owned photography generally would apply to the mere exposure of film.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.888" offset="8746924">Now it’s that holding that comes over into these cases here, where they say, well now we have already held that the license is only on, now that’s not quite true, it was true in the Graves case, because that’s all Graves did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.039" offset="8811499">But they’ve now come along and said, but that’s all you have to do in order to be subjected to the license.</text>
