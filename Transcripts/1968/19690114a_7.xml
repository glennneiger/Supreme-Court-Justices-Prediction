            <text syncTime="42.385" offset="272906">These events occurred on December 12 within nine days.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.265" offset="292446">The plaintiffs filed a complaint in the three-judge court below -- in the court below, thereafter the three-judge court was convened.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.653" offset="334033">About 60 days after, the complaint had been filed the events occurred, the defendants below, the law enforcement officers in Bell County and the county attorney moved to dismissed the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.081" offset="419715">Now, certainly I think that based upon the allegations, the facts that were later shown in support of those of allegations at the time the complaint was filed, there was a clear case or controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.036" offset="483558">And to the extent that it is argued that the court did not have jurisdiction certainly at that point, the court clearly had jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="283.443" offset="1237138">Now, what we think the defendants really argued below and their motion says was a motion to dismiss, but it was based solely -- it was directed solely to the dismissal of that part of the injunctive -- on the prayer which sought injunctive relief against the pending charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.406" offset="1337031">The motion to dismiss was not specifically directed to that part of the prayer that sought the permanent relief of injunctive relief, of restraining enforcement of the declaratory judgment directing itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.171" offset="1400038">The court was aware of that and pointed out that it was perfectly clear in the court below that they no longer had to consider our prayer for temporary relief as to the pending charges since those hadn't been dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.444" offset="1453119">The court went on to say and we think quite correctly that the motion to dismiss was not specifically directed to the ultimate prayer of declaratory judgment or for permanent injunction against enforcement of this statute, and then the court went ahead to find that it was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.944" offset="1519156">And to say that we were entitled to injunctive relief, but as I pointed out yesterday did not actually issue any order in the form of an injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="766.017" offset="3167483">The court below rendered the main opinion, then something called addendum on motion for new trial, but those are the only two papers handed down by the three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.364" offset="3220877">And whatever actual findings, in fact there are or in one or another by those opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.617" offset="3253791">In that connection, it is perfectly clear that the court below was satisfied from the evidence through affidavits that the University Committee members, the named plaintiffs, some of whom were not members of the University Committee, but rather sympathizers, supporters, and associates that all of them had seized certainly in Bell County any type of activity, peaceful activity designed to carry out the purposes of the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.586" offset="3405720">One or two of the plaintiffs indicated that he had seized all activity everywhere because he said this was a state statute and he was afraid that the same thing would happen to him in any county if he engage in similar protest activity as it happened in the Bell County and he did not again want to be subjected to charges, to making bonds and to court appearances and things of that nature and accordingly, he had seized all activities by way of freedom of expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.448" offset="3549184">Article 474 I think, clearly on its face and in view of decisions of this Court from Cantwell versus Connecticut to Ashton versus Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.611" offset="3617834">Article 474 must follow because of that phrase in there, “loud or vociferous language or indecent.”</text>
            <text syncTime="888.315" offset="3656600">Whatever it is, the operative things, then going down to calculated to disturb the inhabitance of the place where the event takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.079" offset="3707695">Certainly, 1966 in Ashton versus Kentucky, in almost identical terms, calculated, I believe was there said calculated to create a disturbance or breach of peace and here, we have calculated to disturb.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.082" offset="3771747">This Court said that that sort of a standard, at least wide open, the standard of responsibility and involves calculation as to the boiling point and does not in any way involved in appraisal of the comments per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.062" offset="3831620">That's the same fault that Article 474 has.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.963" offset="3851264">It is vague because of that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.397" offset="3860982">It will leave to the police officer, to the deputy sheriff a determination at that moment as to whether the language is such as to create the boiling point on water more of the listeners involved and it is overbroad because it obviously includes expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.177" offset="3952097">Therefore, it must fall under Terminiello and Edwards v. Cox.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.902" offset="3971009">It is a combination of both overbreadth and vagueness and as we think essentially, the same -- it presents the same type of problem that this Court resolved easily in the Cox versus Louisiana in which the breach of the peace statute there was condemned, where the Louisiana court had held that it was -- it meant to breach of the peace to agitate, to disquiet, to arouse from a state of repose that those were terms were both vague and overly broad, and that they would sweep within their scope, permissible activities under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.060" offset="4151568">The state here that tries to defend Article 474 by saying that it only prohibits or proscribes conducts in which there is involved so great in amount of noise that is calculated to disturb.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.655" offset="4218023">We submit that that is not a saving interpretation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.344" offset="4232756">It would outlaw practically all modern demonstrations, some of which had been approved by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.391" offset="4256893">In Edwards versus South Carolina, there was singing, handclapping, marching, and things of that nature.</text>
