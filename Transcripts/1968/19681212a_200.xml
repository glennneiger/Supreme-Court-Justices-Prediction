            <label>Mr. John B. Ogden</label>
            <text syncTime="11.521" offset="149504">We're ready, Mr. Chief Justice and member of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.827" offset="166640">I think this case should take a very brief time because of the fact that the petitioner was charged with contempt of Court, convicted without a jury after a written demand and oral demand, and that really is about all there is to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.829" offset="250650">He, likewise, as -- was unable, financially, to get this case or file a petitioned in this Court, and I -- if it’s not improper, I want to just thank the Court for being so generous to this man.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.470" offset="309269">It kind of makes you feel awfully good to see a man without a dime in the world to be able to appear before the highest Court in the country and have his rights determined, and I just say that very sincere and I’m doing what I did for nothing, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.927" offset="367052">So, I really don't have anything financially gained or lose.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.749" offset="386382">If I win or lose the case, it doesn't make any difference, but I just felt like it should be presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.005" offset="403414">Now, if the Court please, in this case, in 1952 in Oklahoma City, there was a default judgment rendered against Mr. Frank, enjoining him from, in effect, violating the Securities and Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.890" offset="462973">He is a man that, to get out and try to drill all wild terrain.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.043" offset="491499">He never made anything at it, but that -- in other words, it wasn't one of these cases where somebody go out and make a lot of money, leaving everybody sitting there.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.693" offset="526190">I don't think his -- I don't think he ever owned a car that's paid for, and I know he didn't own a home.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.011" offset="547401">He's just one of those kinds of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.499" offset="557328">Couldn't do much with him, I guess, so they just filed a suit against him instead of prosecuting him under the Securities and Exchange Act, and he didn't appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.857" offset="590764">They served a summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.943" offset="595153">They used a judgment against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.886" offset="602885">So then, after that, he just kept on.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.045" offset="611558">He didn't pay much attention to it, and so they filed and got an indictment against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.039" offset="643532">Then, I went up there and defended him in the Federal Court for three to four days.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.481" offset="657324">I don't know how long.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.692" offset="662131">The jury stayed out an hour -- I mean, almost over a day, but they convicted him and got 18 months on appeal at the Court of Appeals in Denver for the Tenth Circuit, and it was reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.235" offset="704345">Then, after it was reversed, it came back.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.385" offset="716884">Why, Judge Volt, whose son at that time was my law partner, Judge Volt was a very kind person, an awfully nice person.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.605" offset="749798">He suggested this case face him.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.526" offset="757426">Almost cried.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.896" offset="762964">Just to let him enter a plea of no contention and get some kind of little sentence and that saved the government and everybody else a lot of time, and he finally did that case and disposed over that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.100" offset="815731">Then, this case came along and I wasn't employed in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.595" offset="837778">Mr. Frank had moved to Tulsa, and that's where the acts actually occurred and, I presume, the person who wanted to be detective, that would've made him cry and Tulsa would've tried him in Oklahoma City.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.198" offset="880201">So, he had another law firm, I mean, a law firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.409" offset="893053">I'm just a one-man lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.553" offset="905592">But, he had a law firm represent him and they demanded and did an excellent job but, jury in, wrote it in writing and orally and every other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.100" offset="939760">And, when they presented it, the District Attorney said it was entitled to a jury and he was relying upon a Section of the statute which he read to the Court and, from this, Judge Bohanem, of the fact that he was entitled to a jury, just try him for this offense without a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.025" offset="1027427">The judge, however was not too much satisfied on that because he made a remark and it's -- if I might read it, I don't know if it'll make any difference, what remark he made but he did make a remark that he wasn't too satisfied about the question of whether he was entitled to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.183" offset="1128155">And so, the judge said “Well, I'm quite concerned about the defendant's right for a jury trial.”</text>
            <text syncTime="264.246" offset="1160338">Then, the District Attorney read Title 18, Section 3691 USCA, and from that, the first part of it -- of that section, would just -- there couldn't be any question about it, but the last part confused the judge apparently because the first part of that section, the Code says “Whenever a contempt charge shall consist the willful disobedience of the unlawful writ, process, or order, process or to rule a decree or command of any District Court of the United States by doing or omitting.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.286" offset="1308505">Omitting any act or thing violation thereof and the act of thing having done were omitted also constitutes, I think this is important, this argument, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.547" offset="1349569">Also constitutes a criminal offense under any act of current risk or the laws of any state in which the act was done or omitted the accused upon demand, therefore, shall be entitled to a trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.246" offset="1412368">Now, that's USCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.826" offset="1422712">That's the code and that's the Section there.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.149" offset="1432012">Now, then if we could just stop there, then nobody would've been confused and this case wouldn't have been here.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.822" offset="1454686">But, the District Attorney argued and he claimed that, by virtue of this last part of that same section, that -- well, he wasn't entitled to a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.610" offset="1501811">Now, frankly, I don't know what that last part means, but I just would like to read for the reason that that is the reason of the trial judge, I think, denied him of a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.434" offset="1553115">This Section shall not apply to contempts committed in the presence of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.860" offset="1574849">Well, of course, everybody knows that anyways.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.718" offset="1582268">If you get open Court, you just go and use a language, something the judge wouldn't have to call the jury to try it when it's committed in his presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.472" offset="1609226">Or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.620" offset="1625840">Now, here's the part “nor contempts committed in disobedience of any lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command entered in any suit or action brought or prosecuted in the name of or on behalf of the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="399.818" offset="1702640">Now, that last part there is what caused the trial judge and cause this man to be denied trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.968" offset="1731271">So well-said that this was an act originally where the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Mr. Frank and got that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.425" offset="1769096">That's what this charged with violating.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.756" offset="1778395">Since he was charged with violating that Act, the trial judge thought that that was an order of the United States, which I guess it was because that is, of course, part of the United States Government, the Exchange Commission, and so -- but, regards to that, it's my contention and thought, I don't think it had application whatever to that, but it's my contention and thought that there wouldn't be any way to start out with if Congress would pass a law today and say “Well, you can try this man, give him as much as five years, but you -- he don't -- he's not entitled to the jury trial.”</text>
            <text syncTime="460.044" offset="1943594">In other words, Congress couldn't take away a man's constitutional rights to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.601" offset="1961775">If it tried to, I don't think that action does, but I can't find any construction of it and I can't tell you what it meant but -- I mean, what it's been construed to mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.892" offset="1998973">But, in any rate and regards for all that, we all know that at least I do, that the Congress couldn't pass a law and say “Well, you're -- because, under the Sixth Amendment, it says “In all criminal offenses,.”</text>
            <text syncTime="489.081" offset="2059682">Well, this is a criminal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.171" offset="2072012">And, if you'd pardon me for being personal, in 1937, I use to be State District Judge for 12 years in Ardmore and I held a man for contempt to Court that's cited in this opinion here by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.784" offset="2142542">I mean, I say it's cited just referred to but, in that case, the Court said that contempt was a criminal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.919" offset="2179009">Then, our Court, the Court of Criminal Appeals of Oklahoma City, we don't appeal by regular Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.563" offset="2201579">It's just how one Court for Criminal Appeals, one for Civil.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.353" offset="2220805">Call the Court of Criminal Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.300" offset="2228537">Well, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, ever since statehood has held consistently and every time that a man is entitled to a jury in any case where he's charged with violating any order of any Court, and then the Constitution of Oklahoma so provides, and then the Constitution of the United States, it would seem to me that the Constitution of the United States is just as clear in the Sixth Amendment been “in all,” it don't say “part of them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="566.845" offset="2370748">Then, if you-- how do you classify this?</text>
            <text syncTime="569.512" offset="2381406">Well, they want to classify it apparently, I say they and I mean the Solicitor General, they want to classify it as a petty offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.610" offset="2409827">They will have to sp -- if you got three years, well, a petty offense is defined by the statute and it's Title 18, Article I, and it's defined and it says a petty offense cannot be more than $500 or six months in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.799" offset="2474611">Now, that's set out in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.552" offset="2481612">It -- that's defined by the statute itself as a petty -- this can't be a petty offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.753" offset="2502405">Then, that same Section also defines a felony, and it says that “any offense,” now this is that same Section that I just referred to defining a petty offense, also says that “now, we'll see what a felony is.”</text>
            <text syncTime="616.499" offset="2569383">If a man can get that or if he can get more than one year, it's a felony under the Act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.198" offset="2596133">That's the same Section.</text>

            <text syncTime="753.260" offset="3116387">And, that if he then violated the probation and he had another proceeding to effect the imposed sentence, that's actually the sentencing then.</text>

            <text syncTime="828.412" offset="3417004">Now, if Your Honor please, that, I've always considered if you put somebody on probation for three years or five years, that any time during that period of time, if they violated the probation, they just had to go serve the three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.194" offset="3472175">Now, that's my conception of it but I might be wrong, but I want to call this to your attention then I'm through.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.302" offset="3496626">In this case, just look how foolish it would be if you put a constitutional provision in here that a man is entitled to a jury trial in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.248" offset="3532361">Well, is this a criminal case?</text>
            <text syncTime="859.301" offset="3540616">No, that's the way it looks to me, but say whether put him on probation so you can't complain about that it's a wait "just a minute".</text>
            <text syncTime="867.703" offset="3574157">Under the Solicitor General's brief and his opinion, I mean, I guess it's the way I construe it at least, his opinion simply is that you're -- say, you're a Federal District Judge and you come up here and a man is going to be tried and say “Well, now, just a minute."</text>
            <text syncTime="881.724" offset="3630268">You want a jury trial but I can't tell whether I'd give you a jury trial or not until I try your case and see whether I put you on probation, I may decide to put you on probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.536" offset="3673527">So, if I do, you wouldn't be entitled to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.128" offset="3683871">So, I'll have to try you first to see whether I'm going to give you probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.791" offset="3698500">Then if I decide I couldn't give you probation, then we'll have to call a jury.”</text>
            <text syncTime="903.138" offset="3715950">That was what that actually means in a case like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.294" offset="3728593">Now, this man, to start out with, it's a lot more serious, I guess.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.611" offset="3753775">I never had been tried, but -- in a criminal case, but I do believe, or any other kind, but I do believe this, that a man either has the right to a jury trial in this kind of a case or he doesn't have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.837" offset="3806751">I don't know whether he does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.259" offset="3812394">He's charged with criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.117" offset="3823888">The punishment might have been three years and he'll have to serve up to five.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.678" offset="3842069">I don't -- it could go up to five, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.803" offset="3850533">But, anyway, he either -- when he walked up there and said “judge, I want a jury trial.”</text>
            <text syncTime="941.897" offset="3870908">Now, I don't think,” of course I won't tell you this.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.517" offset="3881462">Frankly, of course, I wouldn't have a way.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.503" offset="3889403">I wouldn't even claim I had any knowledge whatever on what a jury would or wouldn't do because no one does.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.137" offset="3915943">But, at the same time, I really think the jury would turn him loose, but they might not.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.091" offset="3935692">But, regards to that, he had that right and he had a right to say “I won't plan in here to say, by unanimous verdict, that I'm guilty of a crime or I'm not guilty of a crime.”</text>
            <text syncTime="970.666" offset="3986056">Here's a man, of course, that doesn't make any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.916" offset="3995042">That poor man is, I guess, 80 somewhat years old, I don't know, but I know one thing, that there wouldn't be a man in this Courtroom anymore sincere that what he did that he thought he was doing right.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.345" offset="4052720">I just actually believe that in my head.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.685" offset="4062124">But, whether he did or didn't, he was entitled to jury trial and, in my opinion, should have.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.025" offset="4091486">Now, there's one other thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.356" offset="4100786">Now, that is a case cited here in that opinion, but the Court of Appeals believed it, Joiner -- C.M. Joiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.224" offset="4132237">Well, this man here is just like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.711" offset="4142268">There are some of the old people getting baptized that believed him that they can find all some kind of a doodle bug or something and you could -- you'd have to kill them to make them not believe that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.059" offset="4175600">They actually believed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.454" offset="4181138">And this old man Joiner lived near me in Ardmore and he couldn't even pass Grossville.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.150" offset="4199946">He went on here in Texas, discovered the Texas Oil Field, the biggest field in the world, the first one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.330" offset="4220740">That Joiner, C.M. Joiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.944" offset="4227114">Well, he is one of these doodle bug people too, and that's what this is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.491" offset="4241324">Well, his oil people don't like the doodle bug people, and I don't either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.429" offset="4253132">I don't think it really amount to a hell of meaning, but you couldn't make him believe this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.434" offset="4265148">So, that's all there is to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.146" offset="4271940">And, he went out this time and he didn't think he's violating the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.441" offset="4285106">I had nothing to with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.867" offset="4294823">Didn't know what he had done, but he just goes out and borrowed money, you see, and give people a note for 10 years, then claimed when he hit oil, he'll pay them back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.828" offset="4326693">Of course, it might have been there for getting remedy, but whether it was or wasn't, why, that's why I did math.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.615" offset="4345814">I thank the Court for listening to my argument.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter L. Strauss</label>
            <text syncTime="1078.042" offset="4415509">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.354" offset="4428779">I think, at the outset, there are perhaps a couple of factual matters that I should mention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.559" offset="4453648">The indictment, which was brought against petitioner in 1953 or 1954 and on which he was originally convicted, specified as a period of the offenses for which he was convicted -- the fraud offenses for which he was convicted, the same period on which the injunction, in which this contempt violation is based.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.189" offset="4540165">And so, as far as we know at least, there's not a question of his having continued after 1952, when this injunction was entered, to violate the Act leading at that point then to a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.467" offset="4593246">There is some indication in the record at page 231, I believe, it's not reproduced in the appendix, that in the 37 months proceeding the contempt violation or the adjudication of contempt in this case, the petitioner was able to earn or obtain something in the order of $37,000 from various people from whom he had solicited funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.129" offset="4687914">He did that principally through advertisements in the Tulsa, Oklahoma Daily World.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.836" offset="4710693">These advertisements profit -- excuse me, promised a high level or earnings in a rather short period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.608" offset="4745801">It's true that the transaction was couched in terms of a note, but the Trial Court found, and there is no contest to that here, of course, that this was really a thin disguise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.576" offset="4797628">The petitioner had no intention of repaying the note he gave and that, consequently, the transaction should be viewed as, in effect, a violation of the injunction which the SCC had obtained against him in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.554" offset="4853635">And, I will only -- I'd be on that, that while the injunction was obtained by default, there is no question that petitioner was not, in the first place, served, of course, before the injunction proceedings and, in the second place, personally served with a copy of the injunction after the injunction was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.388" offset="4920926">I should also say, what should be quite clear, that petitioner is not and never has been subject either to a three year jail term or to the threat of such a term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.069" offset="4959692">The judgment of the District Court used the following words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.523" offset="4973484">“It is a judge that imposition of sentence be suspended, and the defendant is hereby placed on probation for a period of three years from this date.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.870" offset="5006817">That's in the appendix at page 24, and you can find language to the same effect in the Court order at pages 25 and 27 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.845" offset="5042761">The Court's reference to impos -- suspension of the imposition of sentence indicates that it was acting according to Section 3651 of Title 18 and, therefore, that it had imposed no sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.914" offset="5095006">The government's view of this case, particularly since it arose after this Court's decision in Cheff versus Schnackenberg, this Court's decision came down on June 6, the order to show cause was issued on June 16, 1966, the hearing on the jury demand was held in July 22, and the final order of sentence came on September 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.214" offset="5184240">So that, the government's position is that once that case had been decided, in effect, any time a jury demand was refused by a Federal Court in a contempt case, the Court was thereby ruling that it would try the case as a petty offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.631" offset="5257906">So that, from the moment the jury demand was refused, we take the position and we have conceded all along the possible penalties which could be put -- imposed in this case were limited to those which could be imposed under this Court's decision in Cheff, that is to say, any punishment which would be possible under -- for a petty offense under the United States Code and the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.120" offset="5367829">So that, the government's position can be stated very briefly, under this Court's cases, there do exists a class of petty offenses which do not require a jury trial, although they may be criminal in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.708" offset="5418193">While in general, the Court has investigated the nature of the offense as well as the penalty provided for it in determining whether to classify any particular offense as petty in this constitutional sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.749" offset="5466363">It determined in Cheff that the nature of criminal contempt was not such as to require a jury trial in all cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.097" offset="5495724">Criminal contempt may be, in some cases, a petty offense, but the penalty range for criminal contempt is not set by statute and, therefore, the Court said as recently as last year in Bloom, that it would treat criminal contempt as a petty offense unless the punishment imposed makes it a serious offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.980" offset="5579316">And, we assume that this frames the issue in this case, whether three years of probation is such a serious punishment as to have required a trial by jury, a punishment which could not be authorized for a petty offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.596" offset="5633755">And, our position is that the punishment is both a statutory punishment for petty offenses and a constitutional punishment for petty offenses and, therefore, that no jury trial was required.</text>

            <text syncTime="2208.534" offset="8937514">I should, perhaps for a minute, discuss Section 3691 of Title 18 since counsel raised the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.800" offset="8966562">This was one of the principle grounds for argument in the Court below, although it was not raised in the certiorari petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.386" offset="8992893">And, basically, the question there, as I think counsel recognized, is whether this was an action brought by or on behalf of the United States or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.255" offset="9024345">If it was not brought on behalf of the United States, a jury trial was required under that Section.</text>

            <text syncTime="2240.790" offset="9066559">In fact, the civil action was brought in the name of the Securities and Exchange Commission, an independent agency of the United States Government, so that, the argument would be that an action brought by that agency was not one brought on behalf of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.884" offset="9126954">Very briefly, I think, the legislative history of the provision, which has been before the Court before, makes it plain that none of the sponsors thought they were distinguishing between actions involving the United States and actions involving one of its agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.379" offset="9180871">The principal concern of the statute was with the use of injunctions and labor cases between private parties to press one side of the dispute, and remarks were made to the effect that the enactment left all powers that exist in the government at present, undisturbed by its passage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.519" offset="9257462">There is no extensive case along the subject principally because I think all Courts to which the question has been presented have treated it summarily, as did the Tenth Circuit below, simply stating that, of course, an action brought by an agency of the United States was one brought on behalf of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2846.933" offset="11491140">Alright, there may be -- there are perhaps several ways in which I can answer that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.459" offset="11509217">One is, there is a basic statutory authorization involved here, Section 3401 of Title 18, which, as we have indicated, is an authorization which is frequently used by United States Commissioners.</text>

            <text syncTime="2865.160" offset="11563969">For petty offenses, necessarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.085" offset="11571702">Over 50% of the petty offense probation terms are in excess of six months, over 25% are in excess of one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.293" offset="11604511">So that, in fact and in practice, there is statutory and practical authorization for this practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.796" offset="11630529">The second argument, it's a policy argument, if that makes any difference, has to do with the nature of probation itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.607" offset="11669817">While it is backed up by the threat of punishment, to be sure, a probation is not a punitive device and I do not believe that anyone subjected to probation views it as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.066" offset="11711613">That is, if he has his choice, he takes the probation and, in effect, as I'm sure the Court appreciates, any defendant preferring to go to jail for six months would be able to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.516" offset="11753409">Even if the law didn't authorize him to refuse the conditions of probation, he could simply announce to the Court “well, I'm going out and first thing I'm going to do is to disobey them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.125" offset="11791862">So that, in practical terms, if one is talking about an alternative which is somewhat within the defendant's control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.554" offset="11829582">As this Court has recognized in the past, probation is a rehabilitative device and is -- it's designed -- really, the decision is to how long it should be is made on the basis of rehabilitative considerations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2974.752" offset="12002408">That is a theory, but it's only a part of the theory as to imprisonment and legislatures, frankly, vary the amount of imprisonment they provide for crimes in direct relationship to their view of the seriousness of the of crime involved, and that's not done in general with respect to probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.996" offset="12075342">So that, we submit, that probation in this case was authorized by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.957" offset="12103241">It meets the tests which the Court set out last terms in Duncan and Bloom.</text>

            <text syncTime="3076.862" offset="12410859">Just take this for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.096" offset="12415770">He's already been on a probation, I'm just going to say roughly two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.053" offset="12435623">Now then, suppose he had violated that, they bring him back over to Oklahoma City and say “Well, you violated your probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.447" offset="12461119">I want to sentence you to six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.807" offset="12470627">” Well, that would be six months plus two years on probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.266" offset="12484420">Now, whether probation, what effect it has or not, if Your Honor please, I'm just going to call this to your attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.272" offset="12512423">I think, and of course I said that just the thought which actually means nothing, but it's just my opinion that when a person put on probation for three years, that if he makes a good citizen, doesn't violate any of the terms until three years, 11 months, and 29 days, then they can take him and make him serve three years, but I think a lot of times, maybe, that I get off of the actual point involved, as I view it, on that question but because all there is to it, as I see it and it probably isn't that simple, here's a man charged of a crime and you say “Why was he charged of the crime?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.281" offset="12680547">Well, because the statute makes it a crime and that's what the Court said here that they found him guilty of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.003" offset="12711372">So, the Court said that “I convict you,” and I will read right here from this appendix and then I think I'm through on that part of it, but it is the judge, this is the Court speaking, “that the defendant is guilty as charged and convicted.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.193" offset="12780126">That's what the judge said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.841" offset="12786709">Now, he was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.468" offset="12793292">Now, when you try a man and convict him of a crime and if you'll notice everything in here, the complaint, the charge, everything, and the case criminal, so and so, the number of the case of the United States District Court was criminal so, in number so and so, criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.533" offset="12861524">And, the charge -- criminal charge, the whole thing had been fitted, of course it is a crime, and there's no any question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.269" offset="12892453">Now then, I want to call then to the Court's attention another time for emphasis sake and I hope it isn't burdensome view but the statute itself should take care of this case and I -- the reason I say it should is because Title 18 Article I US, offenses classified, any offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.896" offset="12978970">Don't make it what offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.093" offset="12983777">Any offense punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year is a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.774" offset="13018467">So now, you try the man for a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.683" offset="13026095">Say, why do you say that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.274" offset="13032469">Because the punishment exceeds a year, and when it exceeds a year, “and death or punishment exceeding a year,” then it is a felony under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.147" offset="13075937">So, you tried a man whose been tried in here for a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.554" offset="13089625">Now, the next -- very next Section says “Any other offense besides that is a misdemeanor.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.010" offset="13115434">Now, I don't -- now, the last one, here's the one that I especially want to call the Court's attention about this petty offense business</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.154" offset="13143960">This is statutory, “any misdemeanor, the penalty for which does not exceed imprisonment for a period of six months,” if you could imprison a man for six months and one day, it's not a petty offense, “and/or a fine not to exceed $500,” if you could find him $501, it wouldn't be a petty -- “or both is a petty offense.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.099" offset="13255764">That's what the law says of petty offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.644" offset="13265899">Then, the constitution says that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a trial by impartial jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.520" offset="13293484">Now then, the question, is this a criminal prosecution?</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.391" offset="13304978">It certainly is not a civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.230" offset="13312293">Now, may I read what the judge said to this man here, what's on this, “it is a judge that had found guilty.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.067" offset="13335594">Now, that -- I want to call your attention to one other thing and that is that, on this -- it's in the brief of the Solicitor General and it's in the appendix, and here it is just here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.072" offset="13407692">He sets out in here the conditions under which Mr. Frank had to serve for these three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.694" offset="13454190">Now, I won't read them all, “but you shall refrain from a violation of any law, federal, state, or local.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.620" offset="13477804">You shall get in touch immediately with your probation officer if arrested or questioned by law enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.585" offset="13505703">You shall associate only with law abiding persons and maintain reasonable hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.322" offset="13532662">You shall work regularly at your occupation and support your legal dependents if they're into the best of your ability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.865" offset="13558784">When out of work, you shall notify your probation officer at once and you shall consult him prior to change in jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.530" offset="13585533">” You can't even change jobs without him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.633" offset="13593893">“You shall not leave the judicial district without permission of the probation officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.160" offset="13611969">” Oklahoma is divided into three districts: northern, and the western, and the -- let's see, the northern, the western, and the eastern districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.426" offset="13649063">It's safe through that in those three districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.626" offset="13657840">Well, he is in the eastern district, up there at Tulsa.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.095" offset="13667767">He can't even leave that district without permission and say, while it didn't matter much, I'd hate to have to get to where he couldn't leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.850" offset="13694725">I think it's a restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.420" offset="13701099">“You shall follow the probation officer's instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.630" offset="13709876">You shall report to the probation officer as directed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.922" offset="13723042">” And then, “you have to report in Oklahoma City on the first day of each month beginning August 1966, for a period of three years and fill out one of the blank reports and mail, in addition to all this, or bring the same to the probation officer in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.616" offset="13785840">Now then, “your failure to comply with the instructions of the Court as outlined herein will be cause for revocation of your probation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.425" offset="13833070">That's the Solicitor's record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.137" offset="13843937">Now, if the Court please, that's actually all that I care to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.357" offset="13856789">It just seems to me like, that to apply the constitution to this case, that it was a criminal case and all over the United States, I guess, every place I've been, I didn't know in any cities, if they can fine a man over $20, they have to give him a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.641" offset="13937977">They believe, at least, and that's the way they do because of the constitutional position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.124" offset="13955845">But, here's a man whose put on probation for three years and ordered with all these restrictions upon him and, now then, he demanded in writing and orally a trial by jury, and it was denied to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.478" offset="14009240">So, I feel like, under the law, as in this case, and under the decision, it doesn't seem to me, honestly like, when I read it, that when this Court said well, we feel like we should these other -- these judges orally contra when the jury trial is demanded and you set it all out there, I thought of just as plain as it could be, and that's on the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.361" offset="14096802">I exercise my brief because I couldn't see any citing of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.907" offset="14111013">And, of course, if I may again, thank Your Honors for permitting to be appear, it's been a great pleasure.</text>
