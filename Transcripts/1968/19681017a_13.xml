            <text syncTime="29.156" offset="220035">Mr. Kaier, you may proceed with your argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edward_a_kaier" startTime="35.549" stopTime="537.866">
            <label>Mr. Edward A. Kaier</label>
            <text syncTime="35.549" offset="245530">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.447" offset="261204">This is an appeal from a decree of a three-judge court for the Eastern District of Louisiana setting aside an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission which prescribe the joint -- the divisions of joint rates to be received by Northern and Southern Railroads respectively from freight traffic moving between official territory and southern territory in both directions.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.487" offset="381367">Official territory may generally be described as that part as the northeastern part of the United States and the southern territory the southeastern part.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.213" offset="424208">More particularly, official territory would be the territory east to the Mississippi river north of the Ohio and certain cities in Virginia such as Richmond.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.073" offset="471646">Southern territory is east of the Mississippi and south of official territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.663" offset="497977">The appellants are the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Northern Railroads and the appellees are the Southern Railroads and two associations, one the southern governor's conference and the other Southeastern Association of Railroad and Utility Commissioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.372" offset="568822">Your Honors will recall I believe that a joint rate is one which applies over two or more railroads but is stated in a single sum.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.797" offset="610513">The divisions in issue in this case were primary divisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.271" offset="632456">That is to say divisions which applied to and from the certain gateways between Northern and Southern railroads and if there was more than railroad north to the gateway those two railroads over three railroads would get their share of the revenue from subdivisions of the primary division and likewise south of the gateways.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.228" offset="736319">Those subdivisions were not in issue in this case only the primary divisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.517" offset="761396">The railroad's evidence both that submitted by the Southern lines and that's submitted by the Northern lines was on a group basis in which all the Northern lines were grouped together and there figures submitted by on the group basis and likewise for the Southern lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.892" offset="854915">And it was decided by the Commission on a group basis except that the Norfolk Southern Railroad one of the Southern group, was awarded division higher than that granted to the Southern lines generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.867" offset="914892">This was in recognition of its greater revenue needs and there is no issue about that before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.843" offset="946761">The Commission is empowered by paragraph 6 of Section 15 of the Interstate Commerce Act to prescribe just and reasonable divisions whenever after hearing in its opinion it finds that the existing divisions are unjust unreasonable or inequitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.455" offset="1045191">The case before the Commission was one that was originally decided in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.704" offset="1078209">Before that decision, the divisional factors prescribed for Southern lines were generally 25% higher mile per mile than those prescribed for Northern lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.423" offset="1133066">And on the very important item of citrus fruit which moves in great larger in South to the North, the -- an earlier case had fixed the divisions as high as 85% higher than the Northern lines factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.666" offset="1210075">Now, I should correct that.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.113" offset="1219793">The Northern lines -- the Southern lines didn't get divisions 85% higher but the factors which go into make that were 85% higher so that the Southern line got something a lesser percentage than the 85% but very substantially more than the Northern lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.701" offset="1306206">In the 1953 decision, which is in a decision in the same docket of the Commission as the order here under review -- in the 1953 decision, the Commission concluded that if it were to give controlling weight to the Northern lines cost studies, it would have to give them higher divisions than the Southern lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.814" offset="1410591">But it regarded the sum elements of the cost as being transient in nature and it's found that it would be the safest assumption for the future that neither group of railroads would have a substantially lower basis of operating expenses than the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.198" offset="1504214">So, it prescribed equal fact to divisions for both groups of lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.457" offset="1533158">In 1959, that same proceeding was reopened upon petition of the Northern Railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.338" offset="1568684">They alleged in the petition that the experience of the intervening years had confirmed their contention that their cost were higher than those of the Southern lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.759" offset="1610376">The Commission reopened the case; evidence was taken between 1959 and 1961 resulting in what the lower court called a massive record.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.299" offset="1660531">There were extensive briefs proposed report by two examiners recommending increase divisions for the Northern lines, exceptions, replies and oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.904" offset="1718941">The Southern lines contended before the Commission that the relative costs of performing the service involved constitute the decisive measure in determining just and reasonable divisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.678" offset="1782053">They urged the Commission to find such cost on the basis of the average territorial costs as shown by the Commission's Rail Form A formula for official territorial lines and for Southern territorial lines respectively but subject to 12 adjustments in those territorial average cost which Southern lines proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.586" offset="1897723">The Commission accepted five of the adjustments and rejected seven.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.923" offset="1923114">The result in unit costs, cost per ton for certain services per ton mile for certain for train mile for others, those unit costs were then applied to the Southern lines traffic study which those lines stated and the Commission agreed accurately measured the transportation characteristics of the precise traffic to which the divisions involved applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.995" offset="2059368">The Commission found that the cost that which it thus arrived that is the Form A territorial cost with five adjustments that were permitted were reasonably accurate and reliable for determining the relative contribution by the groups on a cost of service basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.448" offset="2145155">It found that both groups of carriers are being efficiently operated.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.099" offset="2167724">It examined each of the other factors specified by Section 15, paragraph 6 and on all the other facts of record and it concluded that everything was equal except the cost of performing the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.368" offset="2252884">It found also --</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward A. Kaier</label>
            <text syncTime="543.315" offset="2276603">As to which it found the Northern lines cost higher than those of the Southern lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.692" offset="2302098">And it concluded therefore that the relative cost of the parties in performing the service but properly serve as a guide for the determination of just reasonable and equitable divisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.609" offset="2365837">That then was the end of everything except to translate its cost findings into division scales.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.578" offset="2405648">The Southern lines asked the Commission to base the divisional scales to be prescribed on their cost evidence as modified to the extent that any of their proposed adjustments might be rejected and the Commission did precisely that.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.407" offset="2477014">Its formal finding of course was at the present divisions were unjust and unreasonable and inequitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.284" offset="2504495">It prescribed the new divisional scales from the Southern lines cost as adjusted.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.237" offset="2532289">Ten of the 11 Commissioners concurred in the majority opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.075" offset="2551724">One Commissioner thought that the Northern line should have increased divisions but not as rate in increase as had been prescribed in the majority opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.956" offset="2599163">Overall, the divisions of the Southern lines were reduced by 3% that's a stipulated figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.650" offset="2645974">Upon suit by the Southern lines and the two conferences that I have mentioned the southeastern association and the southern governors, the District Court held that the cost evidence should have been more refined than the territorial averages that the Commission itself was obliged to see the evidence of the cost of performing the specific traffic was of record and that the order should therefore be set aside for lack of substantial evidence and adequate findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.050" offset="2791528">The District Court's order was stayed pending disposition of this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.068" offset="2815666">The Northern lines have been receiving revenues based upon the higher divisions since April of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.295" offset="2848580">But subject to a refund provision under which if the Commission's order is permanently set aside, the Northern lines would have to refund the difference and amount now approximately $30 million.</text>

            <text syncTime="718.809" offset="2978565">I would like now to discuss the question whether the use of official and Southern territorial costs is supported by substantial evidence and adequate findings of the Commission or whether in truth, the District Court's opinion represents a substitution of its judgment without of the Commission as to the weight to be given evidence and the degree of refinement necessary with respect to the complex question of railroad cost evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.109" offset="3119835">Then I plan to discuss the passenger deficit issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="885.051" offset="3643538">Now, the classic case on that is the New England division's case decided back in 20th by Justice Brandies, in which that kind of revenue need -- was used by the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="904.227" offset="3720234">Now, first as to the Commission's findings I believe, Your Honors, that a review of appendix B to the Commission's report which contains 42 pages of discussion of the adjustments proposed by the Southern lines in the Form A territorial costs will convince -- will be convincing that the Commission has with unusual thoroughness set forth the reasons why it disposed of these cost issues in the manner which it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.058" offset="3883656">And I will not at this point have anything further to say about findings in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.758" offset="3906435">As to the factual support for the use of territorial average costs, I'd like to point out these things to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.467" offset="3945200">First, the investigation brought in issue the divisions of rates on virtually all articles moving between the North and the South from every station in the North to every station in the South over every Northern Railroad and every Southern Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.727" offset="4030255">It was territory wide both of the Northern end and on the Southern end.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.565" offset="4057631">The fact that the proceeding was of such great scope a territory wide proceeding itself I submit established a strong case for the use of territorial cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.705" offset="4110190">Both generally, and with respect to such factors as car costs, switching, empty return ratios and other large factors of that nature as to which the Southern lines said, “Our higher costs” that is they said that the high cost of the Northern lines were attributable to these factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.964" offset="4207261">Now, in the class rate case, which was affirmed by this Court in New York versus United States back in 1947, the Commission said, “There are different degrees of cost of refinement in costs depending upon the purposes for which they are intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.222" offset="4292211">The ascertainment of the cost of transporting a particular commodity over a single railroad or group of railroads obviously requires more refinement in procedure and the calculation of relative cost for transporting all traffic or important and well define segments of traffic by territorial groups of carriers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.778" offset="4398477">The present case was clearly one involving relative costs for transporting important segments of traffic by territorial groups of carriers.</text>

            <label>Mr. Arthur J. Cerra</label>
            <text syncTime="2321.106" offset="9387760">If it please the Court, my name is Arthur Cerra and I'm an Assistant Associate General Counsel of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.369" offset="9420884">These appeals present a question of major importance to the Interstate Commerce Commission's Section 156 duty to ensure just reasonable and equal divisions as between connecting rail carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.941" offset="9475114">Now, as Mr. Kaier's indicated, District Court held that Rail Form A territorial cost not a proper yardstick for measuring North-South traffic, and that the Commission was required to produce more refine data to ascertain the actual cost of that service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.819" offset="9554631">In reaching that conclusion, the court below disregarded key determinations made by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.585" offset="9585664">First, they disregarded first in rejecting the Commission's comprehences of analysis of Rail Form A, and its application to all the units of service that were rendered in North-South traffic, and these units are service being the ones that comprise what is being measured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.809" offset="9682631">The District Court paid little attention to these findings and analysis of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.495" offset="9709380">And secondly, the Court disregarded the findings made by the Commission after its review of all the evidence submitted by the parties that this cost reliably and accurately reflect the traffic in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.367" offset="9772805">Now, those findings were based on evidence that the traffic moves over all railroads and between all stations in both territories, and it's not handled as a distinct entity at all, but rather, it's average traffic handled as an indiscriminate part of all traffic and it possesses no distinguishing characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.150" offset="9863920">Now, this Court observed in the CNNW case that the ascertainment of cost and the treatment of accounting problems concern factual matters relating entirely to the -- and directly pertaining -- excuse me, relating entirely to the special and complex matters of the railroad industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.290" offset="9952528">The court had no familiar -- the court below had no familiarity with these problems and either sought here to obtain more accuracy or to restrict the consideration that the Commission could give to these matters solely to the cost directly pertaining to the traffic in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.928" offset="10047091">We believe that such an effort to achieve a theoretically perfect cost formula really does constitute an unwarranted incursion into the administrative domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.507" offset="10089409">And for this reason, railroads are multi-purpose facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.847" offset="10110725">They produce a number of transportation services for the common use of physical facilities and employee services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.080" offset="10143744">Now, how do we obtain the cost for these services?</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.686" offset="10170075">When there are direct cost, we can allocate them to the traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.322" offset="10188675">When there are not direct cost, they are common cost, there have to be some kind of judgment, empirical judgments made on determining how to allocate this, or how is it done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.343" offset="10236740">It's done on the revenue basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="2558.569" offset="10337677">The same engine is used.</text>

            <text syncTime="2570.532" offset="10385533">Well, you allocate it on the basis of the revenue used that it produces.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.300" offset="10404551">You find out what the costs are, and each traffic bears that portion of those cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.955" offset="10427225">That's what the Commission did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.347" offset="10448750">As I was saying, where a railroad -- as all these railroads are a multi-purpose facilities and they produce a number of transportation services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.271" offset="10500472">When we try to ascertain whereas here, if any given body a traffic uses physical facilities in common and employee services in common with other traffic, and it's been shown that it has not distinguishing characteristics from any other type of traffic, it would appear to us that the application of Rail Form A cost is plainly proper.</text>

            <text syncTime="2917.456" offset="11773158">The Commission has formulated a policy of saying following this Court's decision in North Dakota in 1915, the North Dakota case we cited in our brief that when cost are being considered, the Commission must not only ascertain the cost directly pertaining to the service, but it also must ascertain in a portion those causes which are joint or not directly pertaining to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.905" offset="11886947">And every railroad has certain overhead expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.529" offset="11901471">Now, if we have these overhead expenses and we're going to say that it should not be portioned on a revenue unit basis between all given bodies of traffic, we're going to find out that sooner or later, the railroads are not being able to recouped this overhead expenses from anybody of traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.322" offset="11992691">So as a policy matter, the Commission has said here fully distributed cost, meaning an apportionment of all overhead burdens must be divided and that part will be divided here in accordance that this North-South traffic bears to the total traffic of both groups of railroads.</text>

            <text syncTime="3099.300" offset="12500616">Your Honor, the refinement we made based on the Rail Form A computations and based on the fact that parties who seek to show that there are differences in one given body of traffic as compared to average traffic were shown here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.930" offset="12583058">The Commission reviewed the attempts by the Southern lines to show these bodies of traffic do distinguishing from average traffic, and they rejected seven and accepted five.</text>

            <text syncTime="3151.457" offset="12709177">They parrot the arguments of the Southern lines, but they claim as a matter of law that even if the Northern lines experience higher cost of service, the Commission must find that such higher cost reflect inherent territorial disadvantages before it may give effect to such cost and then territorial division's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.345" offset="12784724">And this contention is based on the premise that the Commission made no adequate findings to dispose of their claim and therefore, its order is going to produce dire consequences and upon the economy of the South and effectively nullify the present and future economic gains that the South was scheduled to receive as by virtue of the New York case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.781" offset="12878451">Well, we ask the Court only to consider the findings that the Commission did make in response to each one of these contentions, and the findings that rejected these contentions or explain why the Commission couldn't accept them or clearly expressed in its report.</text>

            <text syncTime="3305.300" offset="13324622">We have been in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.442" offset="13333191">It's been our observation that there has been no determination, no reasons given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.968" offset="13355238">No adequate reasons given why the decision in the New York versus United States case is not just as sound today as it was in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.894" offset="13394944">And that this business about it being costing more money to run the railroads in the North as compared with running a railroad in the South is not based on any inherent difference, which is the words that this Court used when it became necessary to just divisions or just rates that they should be some inherent difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.602" offset="13489821">And so, you put us on an equal basis, and we've been on that equal basis and we see no reason under the evidence that was submitted before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.944" offset="13527124">We see no reason to change this basis and give the North now a preference in divisions for operating railroads in the North when they have not proven to anybody satisfaction that it cost any more money to operate a railroad in the North and it does in the South today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.942" offset="13595146">If Your Honor please, it's of course, it is inflation matter, and what it amounts to is this, it simply amounts to the fact that under this order of the Commission, they are going to give them an average of 17% more, up to a maximum of 34% more, but carrying the same amount of freight over the same distance in the North as it relates to the South.</text>

            <text syncTime="3889.309" offset="15660596">And this is the other thing that the Commission is doing in this case that I think is very significant is that for 30 odd years, they have followed the principle of primary local responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3902.387" offset="15712946">And that is that the territory where the cost factor is involved should bear the course to that territory, not super impose it on some other territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3912.369" offset="15752861">And what they're asking us to do in the south is subsidize the northern railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.552" offset="15773550">And one other factor and I will sit down because my time is up and I know Mr. Trienens is a much better lawyer than I ever hope to argue this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3926.107" offset="15807822">But the other factor is these commuter deficits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3929.893" offset="15822973">Now, you gentlemen know, may it please the Court, that the south has come a long way in the last 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3936.813" offset="15850663">You also know that according to every economic indicator in this country today, we are still below any other section of the country regardless of the progress that we have made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3946.981" offset="15891310">They have settled us, the Commission has in this case, with commuter deficits in the north, which have no relationship whatsoever to us in the south at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3958.212" offset="15936240">However, I happen to have the privilege this month of heading up a committee in Atlanta, Georgia to go to the people in metropolitan Atlanta for a $433 million bond issue, nothing to do with the railroads now, $433 million bond issue for rapid transit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3978.743" offset="16018369">And we are coming to grips with that problem because we know we have to come to grips with that problem, and we don't think that we should have to subsidize the commuter deficits in the north, and at the same time come to grips with the problem ourselves in the south and pay that ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3996.204" offset="16088168">We simply, in conclusion, we simply feel this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4000.081" offset="16103737">We want equal treatment with all sections of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4003.834" offset="16118680">We want a free economy unhampered by any manmade trade barriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4010.479" offset="16145324">And certainly if we think we are entitled to equality of equal treatment with any other section of the country, and certainly if we are going to receive less than that, we think that the Commission should at least give us some explanation while we are going to have to be relegated to a second class status.</text>
            <text syncTime="4029.153" offset="16220035">Thank you very much.</text>

            <text syncTime="4262.885" offset="17154905">Rail Form A is a formula that chops these railroads costs into various elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4268.530" offset="17177475">We have no quarrel with how it divides the cost as between elements vital, terminal or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4275.543" offset="17205582">What we did was we analyzed this Rail Form A cost, and we said “How come these Form A averages are 17% higher? How does it happen?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4287.118" offset="17251871">Well, we looked at that sort of thing we would all think of as railroad cost first.</text>
            <text syncTime="4290.876" offset="17266918">The sort of thing Mr. Cerra indeed talked about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4293.686" offset="17278098">Running a train, paying the crew, buying the locomotive, fuel, maintaining the roadway, stations, all the sort of things you first think of in railroad costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4302.700" offset="17314147">Are they higher in the north on an average basis?</text>
            <text syncTime="4305.662" offset="17326059">No, it doesn't cost anymore to run a train in the north.</text>
            <text syncTime="4308.933" offset="17339120">And that's true whether you use these Form A averages or you don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="4313.515" offset="17357406">The Rail Form A and these averages have nothing to do with this inflation when it's the items that you think of is running trains, maintaining the roadway and that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="4322.682" offset="17394082">So, where did this inflation come from?</text>
            <text syncTime="4324.928" offset="17403068">Here's where it came from.</text>
            <text syncTime="4326.518" offset="17409442">It came from a handful of items.</text>
            <text syncTime="4329.520" offset="17421458">Commuter deficits, border point interchanges, car cost, empty return ratios and just a handful of items that we discussed in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4342.123" offset="17471822">Now, it's not surprising and shouldn't be surprising that the cost for some items are higher in the north.</text>
            <text syncTime="4347.428" offset="17493034">After all, the north is a very different place.</text>
            <text syncTime="4350.197" offset="17504110">It's a highly industrialized territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="4353.742" offset="17518320">Of course they got a lot of commuter service in the south as of now.</text>
            <text syncTime="4357.558" offset="17533576">It hasn't anything to do with north-south freight traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="4361.253" offset="17548413">And indeed the Commission found as a finding of fact that many items, many items of suburban service are solely related to suburban service.</text>

            <text syncTime="4611.147" offset="18547963">And this bears upon the argument that we got to use Form A cost and these averages because it's essential to our rate cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4618.485" offset="18577324">In that case, they had among other freight commodities not merely citrus fruit, but all perishables from north-south, territory wide, and somebody put in Rail Form A unadjusted cost with respect to these rates that they were increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="4634.069" offset="18639600">And the Commission said “Territorial average cost are entitled to little weight in determining the cost of handling particular movements.</text>

            <text syncTime="4798.251" offset="19296423">Alright, now how did they get the inflation?</text>
            <text syncTime="4800.134" offset="19303946">Well, they said, “Here is an element of cost of interchange.</text>

            <text syncTime="6508.063" offset="26135594">Mr. Trienens agreed that the Form A cost formula is a good cost formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="6515.909" offset="26167045">The territorial cost as developed by that cost formula were applied to the precise elements of service incurred in performing this north-south traffic as revealed by the southern lines cost study.</text>
            <text syncTime="6532.537" offset="26233501">The southern lines know where to look for situations in which territorial average costs may not proper -- accurately reflect the cost of this service.</text>
            <text syncTime="6546.599" offset="26289716">They looked for those places.</text>
            <text syncTime="6548.760" offset="26298389">They presented to the Commission their reasons why they thought that territorial average cost were not good.</text>
            <text syncTime="6557.048" offset="26331512">The Commission minutely examined each one of those reasons in appendix B to its report, and showed that these adjustments of southern lines were based upon assumptions and wholly invalid evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6572.626" offset="26393893">And they showed why they thought the territorial average cost were good.</text>
            <text syncTime="6576.447" offset="26409148">I commend to Your Honors a reading of Section (b) to the Commission's report.</text>
            <text syncTime="6580.726" offset="26426284">And I believe you will be satisfied about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6584.170" offset="26440077">Mr. Trienens talked about car costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="6588.403" offset="26457004">They said that they wanted to get the cost closer to the north-south traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="6592.712" offset="26474245">And what do you suppose they offered in substitution for the northern and southern lines cost, on car cost?</text>
            <text syncTime="6599.894" offset="26502980">They used the average car cost of all the railroads in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6606.265" offset="26528475">And the Commission minutely examined that and said no that that wasn't representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="6611.023" offset="26547493">That the northern and southern lines own cost were more representative of the car cost than the U.S.car cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="6619.990" offset="26583333">The southern line said, “The car cost of the northern and southern lines are not representative here because mostly in this service boxcars are use, whereas the northern and southern lines have more open hopper cars.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6634.441" offset="26641115">The Commission analyzed that, and it found that it cost more to own and maintain open hoppers than boxcars.</text>
            <text syncTime="6643.494" offset="26677373">So to that extent, the territorial cost would over -- would be an overstatement, rather than an understatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6651.936" offset="26711124">Now, if Your Honors please, they also said that there was a difference in utilization.</text>
            <text syncTime="6656.995" offset="26731395">The Commission analyzed that and found that that wasn't a factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="6660.616" offset="26745814">The Commission said, “It is known what the facts -- what factors caused the northern lines to have higher car cost than southern.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6670.082" offset="26783744">In the first place, northern lines have more -- have higher wages, pay higher wage rates than southern lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="6678.301" offset="26816554">They said the northern lines pay higher taxes than southern lines and that overall there is a greater utilization in the south than in the north.</text>
