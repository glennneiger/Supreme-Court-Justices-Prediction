            <text syncTime="100.902" offset="506964">The Supreme Court of California has upheld this license agreement to the practical effect that the patent is immune from challenge of validity and also to the practical effect that established federal criteria need not govern the determination of the scope of the patent when it's enforced under the agreement in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.300" offset="620544">What we're asking this Court is to rule that the patent laws and the protection afforded by them cannot be so extended by private agreement between individual parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.047" offset="687522">We're asking that this Court rule that patent rights cannot be so extended under state law so as to render the validity and interpretation of the scope of the patent immune to the criteria of the federal patent laws.</text>

            <label>Mr. C. Russell Hale</label>
            <text syncTime="285.594" offset="1245706">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.945" offset="1251140">Well, Your Honor that really highlights the federal issues that are before this Court, in that, there was one patent and it disclose essentially the structure of the California Model 2156 gyros.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.354" offset="1324805">The Michigan structure was independently developed a different facility in view of the procedures that were used in assembling the California gyros and the Michigan gyros.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.956" offset="1407248">The Michigan gyros were originally included as coming within the scope of the patent application and hints the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.357" offset="1452805">So, an interpretation of the scope of the patent application that patent are very basic to this questions that's before the court likewise, whether or not Lear has the right to challenge the validity of this patent raised it very basic federal issues before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.313" offset="1568580">The California Supreme Court based decisions solely under the terms of a license agreement that was entered into between the parties in 1955 and the California Supreme Court felt that we're not concerned with defenses which might be available to Lear in determining questions of validity and infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.599" offset="1657814">California Supreme Court apparently felt that the agreement was supreme.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.558" offset="1681638">It need not be concerned with the details of federal law that control patent matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.600" offset="1713821">The Court even went so far to say valid claims are not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.653" offset="1737958">But we submit that parties should -- it's against pubic policy for parties to collaborate and export patent rights regardless of validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.717" offset="1802219">Under the circumstances of this case if Lear and Adkins had so desired, it could've join forces, paid no attention to whether or not the patent was valid or not but enforced it by this year economic power and that public interest certainly would not be served by such an arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.265" offset="1912456">The California Court also when so far as to say it doesn't matter how this patent was obtained to the patent office, patent every issues below, that's all we're concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.513" offset="1957386">We don't care whether new matter was added in violation of the federal rules, decisions of this Court for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.358" offset="2004825">The California Court said we're not concerned if whether or not fraud has practiced on the patent office.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.793" offset="2038575">We submit that those raise very basic federal issues Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.706" offset="2062190">Such a decision results in extension of patent rights far beyond the rights that would be available in an infringement action.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.607" offset="2109837">It also permits individual states to employ standards and patent matters that differ from state to state.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.034" offset="2143483">For example, as matters stand today the law in California concerning licensee estoppel is exactly contra to the law in the State of Michigan knowing the State of Minnesota as stated by the Minnesota Supreme Court in 1954 in the case of Crew versus Flanagan which is cited in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.502" offset="2269393">The ultimate result of the decision of the California Supreme Court is the enforcement of the patent which the trial court in California found to be invalid as a matter of law for failure to meet the constitutional standard required for patentability.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.016" offset="2351417">We submit that an agreement basing a decision solely upon an agreement whereby patent rights are so extended is against public policy, against the policies and provisions of both the patent laws and the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.318" offset="2440652">If an agreement can be employed to circumvent the constitutional standard required for patentability, i.e. uniform federal standards cannot be maintained in the 50 states and this is sticking example of one state that is out of step with some other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.438" offset="2533125">The most significant dates and events that are involved in this case are set forth in the chart that I have behind the lectern and I will refer to these dates during my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.507" offset="2605432">The Adkins' patent application in the subject matter ensued was filed in February of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.456" offset="2645243">The agreement was entered into in September 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.584" offset="2665723">It is the first document in appendix 2 of the record which we reproduce.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.549" offset="2697592">The rights and the obligations of the parties under this agreement are based on the claims are set forth in the patent application which was filed by Adkins in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.005" offset="2755375">And only to the extent that the claims are patentable, the agreement is very explicit in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.392" offset="2784946">Lear agreed to pay royalties on its products that employ the invention that is defined by the claims that are patentable.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.957" offset="2823189">Now contrary to the repeated assertions of Adkins that the agreement was based upon the secret ideas discoveries and unpatentable things, the California Supreme Court expressly based its decision on Adkins' patent rights under this agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.863" offset="2894869">For example in appendix 1 at page 192 the California Supreme Court said, the agreement clearly sets forth that royalties are to be paid only for patented or patentable claims which Lear utilized in its products.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.806" offset="2978565">Now, although the agreement and the patent applications covered several devices and features only the feature of bearing alignment, supporting bearings and alignment for rotatable devices involved in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.412" offset="3048991">The technical subject matter is almost identical with that which is before this Court many years ago in Singer versus Cramer which is cited in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.772" offset="3106461">Now, the patent application and the patent which is ultimately issued are also reproduced in appendix 2 at pages 18 and 32, the circumstances under which this dispute arose once that Adkins was employed by Lear in 1951 under an agreement which permitted him to retain title to certain inventions.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.051" offset="3207607">This was covered by a preliminary agreement which is not -- which is never admitted in evidence because it was superseded and cancelled by the 1955 agreement which is item number 2 in my chart.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.011" offset="3279391">Lear had two facilities that at that time one was in California and the other one was in Michigan and Adkins did his work in the California facility and he developed along with other Lear employees this Model 2156 gyros.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.508" offset="3345429">At the same time, Mr. Cureston in Michigan was developing the so-called Michigan gyro and in 1955, Lear started manufacturing and selling both of these devices and they are both employed in military equipment almost exclusively in military equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.526" offset="3441455">And when the license agreement was consummated, the patent application was directed primarily to the way the devices were assembled.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.873" offset="3482833">And as I mentioned earlier in response to Mr. Justice Fortas' question, the two products were included as covered by the agreement at that time because of the similarity of the methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.950" offset="3547199">In 1957, Lear conducted a search of prior art and it found that this method couldn't be patentable to Adkins that call the prior art to his attention and at that time, it renounced any further liability on the Michigan steel gyros, that's item number 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.621" offset="3673840">Now, the patent application was rejected several times and amended several times and one amendment of particular importance is that of December 1958 prior to this amendment, the application was directed to the characteristic features of the Model 2156 gyros.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.844" offset="3766732">Subsequent to this amendment, it was directed primary that the characteristic features of the Michigan steel gyros.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.117" offset="3799855">For example, prior to the amendment the application did not say one word about removable bearings yet subsequent to the amendment, the application contains such wording and Adkins has relied very heavily on that added wording in briefs before the California Supreme Court and also before this Court emphasizing this very feature that was added by amendment many years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.583" offset="3945723">In early 1959, the claims directed to bearing alignment were under adjudging by the patent office, all of them were under adjudging.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.472" offset="3981249">The application have been pending for five years, Lear not received what it bargains for under this executory contract which has some patent rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.988" offset="4019284">So, on the April 8, 1959 --</text>

            <text syncTime="1216.494" offset="4969305">The trial court said, “The agreement is -- was terminated, Lear exercised its rights.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.973" offset="4991248">Intermediate Appellate Court said the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.993" offset="5003368">California Supreme Court found this implied condition and it is our position Your Honor that such an implied condition is most certainly contrary to the purposes and provisions of the patent and antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.913" offset="5087065">This is a circumstance that arose only upon the decision of the California Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.542" offset="5125517">So, as of April 8, 1959, it was Lear's position that the entire agreement was cancelled which covered both of the products.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.226" offset="5176299">Now, some eight or nine months later Adkins pushed his patent through the patent office, they issued in early 1960 and the complaint was filed on the same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.703" offset="5250173">The complaint searched first cause of action asserting breach of license agreement of exhibit 8 and unjust arrangement and at the second cause of action misappropriation of Adkins' ideas discovers an inventions in violation of his common law rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.826" offset="5322689">Now, the second cause of action was dismissed and was never tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.267" offset="5368456">The trial court took and ruled that Lear terminate the license agreement by this notice in 1959 and the jury returned the verdict for Adkins on the basis of both products, the California of 2156 and the Michigan steel gyros.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.884" offset="5442957">The trial court granted Lear's motion not standing the verdict concerning the Michigan steel gyros and it left to direct the verdict concerning a California gyros stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.993" offset="5499382">Trial court said that Lear has not stopped to contest validity with respect to the Michigan steel gyros because they were independently developed also because the claims of the patent do no cover the Michigan steel gyros.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.745" offset="5578376">And also patent is invalid or as that trial court is concerned is failing to meet the constitutional standard required for patentability relying upon the A&amp;P case of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.119" offset="5635845">Well, the Intermediate Appellate Court of California ruled generally along the same line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.021" offset="5659460">I won't discuss it because that decision has rendered a nullity of when the California Supreme Court takes the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.187" offset="5700106">California Supreme Court held that this termination was ineffective because of this implied condition that we've just mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.690" offset="5738141">It then adopted the defense of licensee estoppel which was asserted by Adkins and held that Lear was estopped to contest the validity of the patent and was liable for royalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.479" offset="5785266">It also used some criteria in ascertaining the scope of the invention and infringement that we feel are clearly in violation of decision of this Court for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.808" offset="5858617">But under the decision of the California Supreme Court, Lear has two alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.119" offset="5875858">One is to pay the royalties regardless of the patent invalidity and failure consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.706" offset="5902190">Or seize manufacturing the devices, it's deprived of the alternative of continuing a manufacture of the products purportedly covered by the claims of Adkins' patent application in challenging validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.413" offset="5969063">And this renders any licensee that challenges validity vulnerable to suit of infringement and imposition of damages which maybe a much greater magnitude and than those imposed under an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.866" offset="6030817">So, a licensee has to be very well advised before he wants to take such a step.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.864" offset="6074807">Well, now, the issues are the major questions before this Court are --</text>

            <text syncTime="1558.159" offset="6336031">And this agreement superseded cancelled all other agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.869" offset="6370826">Lear for example, wanted to go in to things of that nature and it presented and exhibit U for admission and evidence under an offer of proof at Reporter's Transcript 1018 where Adkins says in representations leading up to the license agreement is impossible for me to give Lear a license on claims which may not be allowed or are not patentable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.251" offset="6512410">Now, evidence along as this line was excluded by the trial court, the trial court said, “You're under this agreement and this agreement limit you to patented or patentable things and not secret ideas, not discoveries, nothing unpatentable is covered.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.927" offset="6579075">And as a matter of fact Your Honor, there was a waiver just before trial of all causes of action other than the issues raised by the license agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.677" offset="6642082">So, all ideas or out of picture, know-how out of the picture, the license agreement doesn't mention know-how in any place nor does it mention ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.807" offset="6686595">The only thing it mentions are things that are patented or patentable and hence, we submit that brings that directly under the federal criteria concerning patent matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.394" offset="6768933">Well, the major questions before this Court are the enforceability of such an agreement containing a restraint which is outside the scope of the rights provided in the patent laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.643" offset="6837896">Number 2, the applicability of licensee estoppel under the circumstances of this case and as the general principle whether the claims of Adkins' patent application are really unpatentable and invalid as a matter of law like the Superior Court of the State of California held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.471" offset="6925249">And there is question number 4, whether the ground rules in enforcing a patent under a license agreement are the same as they are in enforcing a patent in an infringement action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.356" offset="6968822">And the California Supreme Court didn't use the same ground rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.609" offset="6989824">Otherwise, they could've never held that the Michigan steel gyros are covered by the claims of the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.965" offset="7031202">Well, as to question number 1, enforceability of such an agreement, the requirement that Lear sees manufacturing the products covered by the license agreement in order to terminate is not an act granted by the patent laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.827" offset="7086686">Their tendency of patent application provides no vested rights in fact the patent may never issue and this we submit is similar to the situation in Brulotte versus Thys where this Court held that an agreement which attempts to extend patent rights beyond the 17-year period, patents are good for 17 years and if the patent is attempted to be extended beyond that period, it's an improper use of patent rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.432" offset="7241122">We submit that the very same considerations apply here where the patent rights are attempted to be extended before they really issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.614" offset="7289814">We submit that this, such a provision which is at California Supreme Court found was implied in the agreement, renders it unenforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.188" offset="7336103">Such an unwarranted extension of patent rights is particularly objectionable here where products affected are military equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.852" offset="7374764">This is because of the policy embodied in 28 U.S.C. 1498 which permits use by the Government of all inventions without possibility of injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.534" offset="7425546">It also safeguards Government from payment of royalties on species patents because validity can always be attacked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.964" offset="7483225">Now, with reference to the second major question concerning estoppel, the Government has filed a brief as amicus curiae are urging that this Court should complete reject any doctrine of licensee estoppel and advised that counsel for the Government, Mr. Wallace will direct his oral argument to the broad grounds and accordingly I will discuss the circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.053" offset="7635571">Under the circumstances of this case, Lear specifically renounced any liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.310" offset="7668590">It renounced liability with respect to the Michigan steel gyros in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.485" offset="7697324">It renounced liability under the whole agreement as of 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.971" offset="7723238">This placed Adkins in the position that he could've charged Lear as an infringer if he had so desired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.983" offset="7755316">He elected to bring suit for royalties and he relies very heavily on the Hazeltine case in support of his position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.216" offset="7820204">When the Hazeltine case, there was no renouncement of the license agreement prior to the suit against Hazeltine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.668" offset="7854059">They just didn't pay royalties, didn't make royalty reports, this is all brought out in the lower court decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.383" offset="7896900">Under the Hazeltine case, the license order didn't have the right to sue for infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.425" offset="7925112">It was an outstanding agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1999.250" offset="8100342">The amount of the judgment on the California Model 2156 gyros was a little over $16,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.338" offset="8140675">On the Michigan steel gyros, it was -- well, it was almost $900,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.592" offset="8161782">It was $888,000.00 I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.108" offset="8175783">Now, that was as of 1963 Your Honor and which was a period agreed upon for accounting purposes only.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.668" offset="8210056">And of course that the same thing applies today, it's been going on Lear is doing the same thing today, it was during 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.438" offset="8281109">With defense of failure of consideration as well established defense in contract matters and that's what Lear asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.399" offset="8312978">And that's a defense of record in the trial court, in the pleadings and we submit that the doctrine of licensee estoppel should not override such a well-known and undisputed defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.960" offset="8399182">Second circumstance of this case was that the license to Lear was granted under patent application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.295" offset="8424573">That was altered by amendment, numerous amendments were filed in this application and as I pointed out one of major importance was filed in December 1958 which change the tender of face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.592" offset="8505762">Patent issue with claims Lear never seen it invoked the rule of estoppel under such circumstances gives the license order of a patent application the right to change the gist of his invention, covered products that weren't originally considered to be covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.070" offset="8595623">It -- in essence places the licensee at the mercy of the licensor with no mean to readdress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.225" offset="8632299">Now we submit that licensee estoppel should not apply if the agreement is based upon a patent application which is in fact changed -- which is in fact amended from time to time after execution of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.603" offset="8701785">The third circumstance of this case is that the -- has I've already mentioned the license agreement as construed by the California Supreme Court embodied and implied condition for termination that requires Lear to seize manufacturing the products of the agreement in order to terminate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.190" offset="8812126">As this Court held in MacGregor versus Westinghouse, the rule of licensee estoppel cannot be used as a shield to preclude investigation of the validity of a patent where in the absence of a valid patent it would be a restraint of trade and certainly that's a circumstance here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.601" offset="8905749">The requirement that Lear seize manufacturing the devices as a restraint a trade and in licensee estoppel should not be implied as a shield to prevent Lear from defenses concerning this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.944" offset="8979101">Anyone of these three circumstances is sufficient to override any estoppel if an adversity job of the doctrine still survives and Mr. Wallace will discuss that on behalf of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.404" offset="9052975">Now, Lear's third and fourth questions relate to the validity and the scope of Adkins' patent, these are always interrelated because the patent of certain scope then claims must not read on the prior order otherwise, it's rendered invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.257" offset="9140433">And these two questions require an understanding of the bearing supporting apparatus of the Michigan steel gyros and that California Model 2156 gyros and I think perhaps this will help clarify some of the questions that Mr. Justice Fortas was raising earlier.</text>

            <text syncTime="2309.662" offset="9341994">It's the gray covered, very small brief towards the end at page 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.778" offset="9386506">You will find two figures illustrating Adkins' patent and one figure illustrating the Michigan steel gyro.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.399" offset="9428929">Now, Adkins' patent shows a bearing supporting apparatus which implies a cone-shaped seat in a gimbal housing and spherical shape bearing couch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.466" offset="9489220">And the patent states that those elements are shown at both the top and bottom of the figures concerning Adkins's patent and I will elaborate on that little more in the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.393" offset="9540942">The patent states, the bearings may be aligned by placing them on a jig or mandrel and then placing them in the bearing or seeding elements as we've illustrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.837" offset="9582738">When the mandrel is rotated, it causes the bearings to become align and this is accommodated by the engaging surfaces between the cylindrical shape bearing cups in the cone-shaped seats, in view of their different curved shapes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.053" offset="9635610">I'm purporting more or less from the patent I believe exactly from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.011" offset="9655463">Now at the trial, we use this demonstration to illustrate the two types of services we're talking about the cone-shaped seat are the two seats in the framework that's shown on figure 9 and the segment -- the other members are spherical shape, they're portion of spear and we've illustrated this by a piece of a croquet ball.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.700" offset="9838216">This shows the type of action that Adkins used in order to achieve alignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.940" offset="9863084">It provides angular and the so-called angular tilt that you'll see referred to in the briefs due to the two surfaces that are involved that accommodate this kind of movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.350" offset="9920763">Now, we have a model here in Court showing the alignment of the bearings and accordance with Adkins' patent, this was demonstrated at the trial and I think it's essential if the Court will bear with me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.259" offset="9980426">I believe it's essential for thorough understanding of the issue of scope -- scope of the patent, definite patent and patent application that are involved in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.548" offset="10029537">So, Mr. Hartz will demonstrate this model, it's approximately four times the actual size of the actual parts in reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.988" offset="10083349">It shows a cone-shaped seat like the paddle that I just demonstrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.275" offset="10128488">It has bearing caps with a spherical surface.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.096" offset="10147715">This is the spherical surface much like the croquet ball and that I demonstrated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2957.329" offset="11932714">The California Supreme Court actually -- well, in interpreting the scope of Adkins' patent, the California Supreme Court said, “The device of submitted in bearing caps using a mandrel procedure constitutes the essence of Adkins' invention as described in his application.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.132" offset="12027904">Well, that's the essence of his invention, it's in the public domain because he cancelled that the method in a mandrel procedure, the language I've just quoted from is in appendix (a) (1) (192).</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.856" offset="12114840">Now, this is one of the criteria that we feel that the California Supreme Court applied in improperly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.587" offset="12169697">And other major thing was that the California Supreme Court states that alignment of bearing caps in either Adkins or the steel gyros can be accomplished only by the angular displacement of the two caps to the access of the mandrel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.204" offset="12244198">Well, if it please the Court, it's impossible for either these two caps to be displaced to the access of the mandrel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.056" offset="12303548">It's an absolute physical impossibility and we submit that that's a major error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.096" offset="12407724">If I may indulge the Court, I would like to refer now to our opening brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.266" offset="12464462">I believe that's blue at figure 4 which is opposite page 57.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.499" offset="12557354">This figure 4-2 sets forth the main claim of Adkins' patent application and the patent which issued which illustrated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.347" offset="12612733">I will refer to the figures since the print is a little small here and I would like to point out that the letters A, B and C identify the three elements of this invention and Adkins admits that those three elements are old, old in the art.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.978" offset="12687235">He simply says, they have a new cooperative relationship but when he applies his new cooperative relationship he didn't talking about things in the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.183" offset="12736136">And it's the claim that defines the invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.698" offset="12762154">Now, this is one of the exhibits employed in the trial court, and I use it only for the purpose of illustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.924" offset="12783052">It's the left hand figure of exhibit 4-1 and I just referred the Court to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.898" offset="12818996">I would like to point out that the color code on all of these things is the same, red means bearing caps and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.939" offset="12867166">And you'll see here a red element of bearing cap designated A, a bearing proceeding frame B, and means for holding that bearing cap in place designated C.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.551" offset="12937592">Now, the bearing receiving element is in a sloppy hole and loosely fitting hole just like the Michigan steel gyros.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.730" offset="12990255">And alignment is achieved by use of this feature.</text>

            <text syncTime="3334.788" offset="13442487">Respondent contends that the estoppel issue is not before this Court because Lear never claimed in the state courts that federal law gave it the right to contest that validity of the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.817" offset="13506644">But in our examination of the briefs that have been certified to this Court is a part of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.953" offset="13543215">We see that Lear did make this claim based on federal law in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.762" offset="13570382">I believe the clearest example can be found on pages 25 through 28 of Lear's reply brief in the District Court of Appeal in California which under California practice also becomes the brief in the Supreme Court, litigants are forbidden from filing new briefs in the Supreme Court of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.656" offset="13665991">This portion of Lear's brief has not been reproduced in the printed appendix but it has been certified by the clerk as a part of the record and it is on file with the clerk in this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3476.668" offset="14010075">Beginning on page 25, Lear referred to and quoted from Article 1 of the Federal Constitution, the patent clause and then elaborated some of the provisions of the Patent Code which Congress has enacted and then in the course of this particular contention said, “A license or contract concerning patent applications and patents have more than the usual two interested parties.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3529.805" offset="14222608">This is followed by quotations from two other federal cases, one an opinion of this Court, the Precision Instrument Manufacturing Company case in 324 U.S. and then a Ninth Circuit case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.783" offset="14278510">And then finally at the conclusion of this portion of the argument, the contention was put this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.692" offset="14310170">In the present action, the trial court expressly found that plaintiff's patent attempts to cover something that is in the existing fund of public knowledge and something that would be obvious to one skilled in art.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.434" offset="14377148">Thus, plaintiff's patent is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.098" offset="14391777">It does not provide protection for any device or product and its validity with respect to the 2156 gyros can be contested by defendant and also by everyone else because of the public interest which is involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="3720.856" offset="14986846">Now, in the pages that I referred you to in the brief before the California Court we're of the view that because only federal authorities are cited throughout these three and a half pages and the arguments ends at that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="3742.526" offset="15073468">These -- the clear intendment of these pages of the brief is to raise this issue as a federal claim and this was sufficient under the standard which this Court applied in Braniff Airways, Incorporated against the Nebraska State Board of Equalization in 347 U.S. where the clear intendment was to assert a federal claim, no precise terminology need be followed in presenting that claim so long as the state court does pass upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3778.600" offset="15217768">Now, it is true that this reply brief raising the issue was concerned only with the aspects of the case relating to the so-called California gyro and not to the Michigan gyro.</text>
            <text syncTime="3795.997" offset="15287359">But it is also true that the state's Supreme Court consolidated all aspects of the case to gather into one appeal and into one opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.309" offset="15328632">And thus, had this federal claim before it and passed upon it for purposes of the entire case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3814.459" offset="15361233">But even in the absence of consolidation in the court below, the issue of licensee estoppel would still be before this Court because a part of the judgment awarded is for royalties for manufacture of the California gyro, the claimed invention with respect to which this point was specifically raised.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="3914.669" offset="15762056">Well, this is necessary to the decision, yes sir as we read the California decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3926.484" offset="15809285">Therefore, the United States believes that the issue is before this Court and we have addressed ourselves to the issue of whether the licensee estoppel doctrine should now be eliminated in view of the weight and the teaching of this Court's decisions in recent years which have required exceptions to the doctrine and which otherwise have closely confined court enforcement to monopolies to the limited scope authorized by the federal patent laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3963.557" offset="15957556">Under our patent system unlike that of some European countries, patent monopolies are granted in essentially ex parte non-adversary administrative proceedings and as this Court and other courts and indeed Congress had have frequent occasion to observe this system results in the issuance of numerous patents for articles which do not meet the requisites standard of invention upon later investigation, an adversary investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4002.969" offset="16115231">Therefore, as we show in our brief the public interest is strongly dependent under our patent system on the availability of opportunities for private litigants to expose invalid patent monopolies before the courts in order to free the public from their economic effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="4024.352" offset="16200808">In many instances, a licensee may be the only potential litigant who combines the requisite knowledge with the requisite incentive to mount that challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="4037.396" offset="16252949">The practicalities of the business situation may well have induced to licensee to enter into the license agreement even though he had doubts about the validity of the patent or had not had time to investigate the question of validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4054.327" offset="16320658">For example, a Government contractor such as the petitioner must assure himself before he submits his bid that he will be able to perform the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4068.528" offset="16377501">And this means that he must have a legal right to make and sell every component required.</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.015" offset="16403414">When some of those components are covered in issued patents or in patent applications, the pressure to enter into license agreements would seem obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="4086.916" offset="16451062">The basic vise of the estoppel doctrine is that it converts those licenses into incontestable devices for the economic effectuation of invalid patent monopolies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4103.566" offset="16517622">Now, it is instructive to remember that this Court's early recognition of the doctrine of patent licensee estoppel in the 1855 case of Kinsman against Parkhurst and as we point out in our brief, it was a recognition not a holding there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4121.122" offset="16587839">This occurred 35 years prior to the enactment of the Sherman antitrust law, when the patent laws were not yet viewed as it carefully confined exception to the broad interdiction of monopolization in the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="4137.352" offset="16652831">And this Court's first significant limitation of the estoppel doctrine in Pope Manufacturing Co.against Gormully occurred in 1892 two years after the enactment of the Sherman law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4152.792" offset="16714585">Later, in the Sola Electric, Katzinger, and MacGregor cases discussed in our brief, this Court held that the estoppel doctrine may not be applied when the license agreement contains a price fixing clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4168.435" offset="16777070">And in Scott Paper Company against Marcalus Company, the Court held that an assignor cannot be estopped from showing that he was not infringing the assigned patent because he was using only the prior art of an expired patent even though in the circumstances; this amounted to a showing that the patent he assigned had been anticipated and was therefore invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="4192.386" offset="16872887">In his perceptive and candid dissenting opinions in those cases, Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out they have the general doctrines of assignor estoppel and licensee estoppel really could not withstand the rational of those decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4210.525" offset="16945507">And ultimately would have to yield to the same considerations of the public interest that govern the Court's decisions in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4219.469" offset="16981243">But several years later, a majority of the Court tersely re-endorsed the general doctrine of the licensee estoppel in the Hazeltine case and said that the previous cases meant that estoppel is forbidden only if the license attempts to enlarge the patent monopoly through price fixing for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="4241.950" offset="17071208">But as Mr. Justice Douglas joined by Mr. Justice Black asked in dissent in that case, what more egregious enlargement of monopoly is there from the standpoint of public harm than the attachment of a patent monopoly to an unpatentable article.</text>
            <text syncTime="4261.375" offset="17148844">The majority opinion did not answer that question, the question remains unanswered and United States submits the question is unanswerable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4272.443" offset="17193148">More recently in the Sears, Roebuck against Stiffel and Compco cases, this Court held that the states cannot confer upon the originator of the design, the power to exclude others from copying that design that the power to exclude is the exclusive province of the federal patent laws and can attach only to a valid federal patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4297.965" offset="17295235">Now, the power to exclude others for making, using or selling which is conferred by a patent is often utilize by the patentee conditionally in order to read economic rewards from the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4316.844" offset="17370781">Or he excludes others from using the product unless they buy it from him or he excludes others from making and selling the product unless they pay him and agreed upon royalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4324.090" offset="17399724">This is precisely the power to exclude which the decision below has given to the respondent even if his patent is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="4334.206" offset="17440162">And California has thus used the doctrine of licensee estoppel to trespass upon the domain of the federal patent laws and to enlarge the impact on the economy of patent monopoly rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4347.949" offset="17495124">From that, which is authorized by the federal laws just as the Illinois law of unfair competition had been used in Stiffel and Compco to trespass upon the federal domain and enlarge monopoly powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4362.807" offset="17554578">In those cases, this Court held that the states must be confined to remedies that are compatible with the policies of federal law such as the requirement of labeling in that factual context.</text>
            <text syncTime="4376.160" offset="17607973">And likewise here, we have argued in the concluding pages of our brief that the states may device remedies to do equity between businessmen which do not conflict with federal law, but the state should be barred from sacrificing the public interest by applying doctrines of estoppel that result in enforcement of monopolies that are not authorized by a federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4401.423" offset="17709014">Only last term in the Perma Life Muffler's case this Court reiterated that we are dealing here in an area in which the Court has often indicated the inappropriateness of invoking broad common law barriers to relief where litigation serves important public interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="4420.440" offset="17785083">And so, the United States asked this Court in this case to relieve the people of this country of the burden of having to pay royalties for the use of non-inventions and to give the people what the Constitution and the Laws of the Congress say is rightfully theirs, the free use of all the technology that is in the public domain.</text>
