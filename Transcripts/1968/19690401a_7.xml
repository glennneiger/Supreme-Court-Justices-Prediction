            <label>Mr. Victor Rabinowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="41.532" offset="269458">This is in appeal from a judgment of the three-judge statutory court sitting in the Southern District of New York denying two plaintiffs an injunction and declaratory judgment against the District Attorney of Queens County.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.709" offset="338213">The plaintiffs sought an injunction and declaratory judgment to enjoin their prosecution under the New York criminal anarchy statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.932" offset="391084">The facts, the relevant facts I think can be very briefly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.527" offset="405504">On June 21, 1967, the 11 plaintiffs here were indicted together with a number of others, on charges of advocacy of criminal anarchy conspiracy to commit the crime of advocacy of criminal anarchy.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.160" offset="480005">Two of them were also charged with permitting there premises to be used for an assemblage of anarchists.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.558" offset="509576">The indictment was considerably broader than this in that it had 48 counts of which only five come -- five are before the Court on this application.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.839" offset="554715">The other 43 counts all related to specific crimes, most of them to the possession of guns.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.325" offset="592645">Contrary to the law of the State of New York, I think there's also a charge one of the counts relates to a conspiracy to commit the crime of arson.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.806" offset="638621">This case, the indictment here invoked the New York criminal anarchy statute of 1902, which was first applied in the period after the First World War of the early 20's in the Gitlow case.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.339" offset="704763">And was not applied again until 1964 when it was applied by New York State in the case of People against Epton.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.140" offset="747917">This resurrection of a moribund statute in the Epton case and the mass indictment in this case which followed 36 days after, the Court of Appeals decision in Epton poses a threat, we think, to the radical political activity of our time and raises memories of the 20's and the prosecutions of those errors which clearly seem to us to be inconsistent with modern constitutional doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.484" offset="889292">The plaintiffs brought this action and rely largely on the general authority of this Court in cases such as Dombrowski and cases which have followed it, and so far as declaratory judgment is concerned, in Zwickler against Koota.</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="215.786" offset="966510">Do you think the narrowing construction that the Court gave the statute to Epton meets the constitutional problem?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="victor_rabinowitz" startTime="223.606" stopTime="410.905">
            <label>Mr. Victor Rabinowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="223.606" offset="997752">No, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.378" offset="1008933">We argue, of course we'll come to that in a moment, it's a major part of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.535" offset="1033488">The -- we argue that the statute both on its face and as construed in Gitlow is both vague and overbroad and it is clearly unconstitutional, and I don't think there's any argument about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.249" offset="1084374">The Court of Appeals of New York held as this Court has held on a number of occasions that the Gitlow case is no longer law.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.613" offset="1109870">In Keyishian in this Court discussed this very statute at some length and held that it was clearly unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.046" offset="1139545">However, the defendant argues that the New York Court of Appeals in Epton, by means of narrowing construction corrected the defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.506" offset="1173400">And this view was accepted by the three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.772" offset="1190431">The New York Court of Appeals in its opinion narrowing the construction said that, “Well, we think now that the legislative intent of 1902 was to write a constitutional statute.”</text>
            <text syncTime="287.105" offset="1251767">And of course the constitutional doctrine has changed a good deal since that time, and so we will now say that the legislature in 1902 intended to conform to existing constitutional standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.481" offset="1309341">And the three-judge court echoed this somewhat ever epigrammatically saying, “If the 1902 legislature had known it could not have all it wanted, it would have wanted all it could have.”</text>
            <text syncTime="319.155" offset="1379976">And on the basis of this, it held the construction, the narrowing construction of the Gitlow statute constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.833" offset="1414666">Now, there are two primary questions raised on this face of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.937" offset="1431071">The first is whether that narrowing construction in Epton is binding on the plaintiffs in this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.753" offset="1470360">The overt acts charged in this indictment all took place before the narrowing construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.032" offset="1503483">As I say the indictment here was only 36 days after the decision of the court in the Epton case.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.170" offset="1532008">So that none of the plaintiffs in this case had any notice at all of the narrowing construction that the Court of Appeals of New York was going to, which obviously I couldn't tell, which later the Court of Appeals of New York was going to read it to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.516" offset="1601390">And we submit that the plaintiffs can no more be charged with clairvoyance.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.854" offset="1626781">If I may echo what this Court suggest a couple of weeks ago in Shuttlesworth, can no more be charged with clairvoyance as to the plastic surgery that the Court of Appeals were deployed to the Gitlow statute then Shuttlesworth could be charged with knowing what the Supreme Court of Alabama was ultimately going to decide in the ordinance under consideration in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="454.849" offset="1922800">Now, I certainly shall, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.742" offset="1934294">Now, we -- we feel that the, as I say the act -- overt act here were charged after were -- the narrowing construction was not the law of the State of New York, assuming that the New York Court of Appeals had the right to do this at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.313" offset="2000645">It certainly was not the law of the State of New York but till after the Epton decision and we do not believe that the narrowing construction or that the defendants can be held or the plaintiffs in this case can be held liable for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.208" offset="2060204">Furthermore, even in the Epton case the Court of Appeals reconstrued only subdivision 1 of the criminal anarchy law left subdivision 3 and 4 untouched so that -- as to those statutes, those sections of the statutes were true -- which are specifically alleged in the indictment in this case were not construed at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.737" offset="2138363">Now, I submit that the doctrine that a statute which is clearly unconstitutional and which everyone admits is unconstitutional can be reconstrued by a court -- by the highest court of the state is really a most dangerous doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.699" offset="2206177">It means that any state can always resurrect the statute which has been declared unconstitutional by this Court, and without any notice to the persons within the state make a silent statute, an invisible statute, a dead statute again come to life.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.281" offset="2284544">This is much more extreme than the situation in Shuttlesworth because in that case the unconstitutional doctrine was -- the unconstitutional interpretation was pronounced by the Commissioner of Public Safety, and Mr. Justice Harlan pointed out that that was not too reliable an interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.504" offset="2361344">Here we have an interpretation by the Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="640.257" offset="2664364">Discussed the statute that was before the Court in the Gitlow case and said that it was an -- it said in rather strong language I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.960" offset="2699264">It said that this statute is clearly impermissible under current constitutional standards and it discussed subdivision 3 which is one of the sections here and said that under the statute as interpreted by Gitlow, a man walking down a campus with a copy of Karl Marx's doctrine in his hand might be violating the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.520" offset="2781497">I believe that was the example used by the Court in the Keyishian case.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.595" offset="2805739">So it will not be argued here today that the Gitlow interpretation is any longer a valid interpretation under the doctrine, even if Dennis for that matter because even Dennis in that opinion suggested that the Gitlow case was really doubtful, and that in many standards inconsistent with, as I say a larger range of cases, the Scales case, the (Inaudible) case, and the whole range of constitutional decisions in the last 10 years of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.455" offset="2937187">So that I think that the situation is very similar to the Shuttlesworth case.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.890" offset="2962892">There, there was and I'm paraphrasing the decision of the court, but I think it's the same paraphrase that Mr. Justice Harlan used.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.898" offset="2994970">This Court held that where a statute is interpreted in an unconstitutional fashion by the Commissioner of Public Safety that Mr. Shuttlesworth had the right to treat that statute as void and could not be charged with clairvoyance that the Court would later hold that the Commissioner of Public Safety was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.908" offset="3090996">Now here, we have not the Chief of Police holding -- giving the statute an unconstitutional interpretation, but the New York Court of Appeals giving what is today an unconstitutional interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.268" offset="3140420">Although, obviously, at the time of the Gitlow decision that ipso facto was unconstitutional interpretation because the Court so said so.</text>

            <text syncTime="840.011" offset="3463398">And one of the most serious defects in the Court of Appeals interpretation in the Epton case relates to the clear and present danger or rather unsatisfactory test under the best of circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.423" offset="3513031">But at least in the Dennis case, in applying the clear and present danger test, the Court clearly said that there must be a clear and present danger of an overthrow of the Government of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.258" offset="3568410">In the Epton case, the Court found it quite sufficient that there was a finding of clear and present danger to commit a riot.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.098" offset="3607803">Now, if the all that the clear and present danger test means in the eyes of the New York Court of Appeals, and if that is the cause placed on the statute now, is that the crime of sedition requires only that there be a clear and present danger of this order which is a far cry from the overthrow of the Government of the United States, or even the overthrow of the Government of New York, then I submit that we still have a statute that is unconstitutional even under the Epton decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.132" offset="3731937">Now, in Dombrowski, this Court held that it will not abstain in a case such as this -- such as was presented in Dombrowski, where the policy reasons were operated against in one of the elements in the policy considerations, or among the elements in the policy considerations in Dombrowski, which motivated the Court in deciding against the doctrine of abstention, was that this was a First Amendment situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1471.433" offset="5989125">And interestingly enough, you will note there are -- that the overt acts that the -- that all through the anarchy counts, you find the dissemination of ideas by word, by distributing pamphlets.</text>

            <text syncTime="1496.652" offset="6089958">But I want to get back to what we claim -- what I claim in this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.290" offset="6116498">This is a two -- a double barreled attack not only on the anarchy statutes but also on the grand jury statutes in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.471" offset="6157249">And they go together very well here, because you have black people, Negroes accused of political crimes and they are indicted by a predominantly white middle-class grand jury which is chosen by statutorily set of subjective standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.743" offset="6258395">Now, I want to go back a little bit to the history with regard to this anarchy statute and what happened to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.331" offset="6304684">It was passed as you know in 1902, and it came to glory as it were in 1920 when in February Mr. Gitlow was convicted of anarchy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.449" offset="6349197">Even though as you all recall, he was a socialist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.246" offset="6368319">It went through the New York Court of Appeals in 1922 when that court gave a ringing opinion saying that the state had a right to protect not only itself but the Government of the United States from subversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.521" offset="6433416">It was approved by this Court in 1925 in an opinion which specifically excluded the concept of clear and present danger, and that was clarified by a dissent of Homes and Brandeis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.331" offset="6504678">And then that statute was never invoked in the State of New York again until the summer of 1964 when William Epton was indicted by a grand jury in August by the same white middle-class set up under the same statutes that we are challenging here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.898" offset="6603003">And then there's something that has not been argued in any of the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.879" offset="6614915">In fact, I really just came across it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.387" offset="6628916">That in 1945 after Epton had been indicted the legislature of the State of New York met and amended the anarchy law, left out force with regard to the overthrow, simplified it a great deal, and also said that the anarchy had to only be directed against the State of New York, and in the practice commentary of the framers of the legislation, Mr. Danzer and Mr. McQuillan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.072" offset="6811669">They say this section substantially restates one phase of the former penal laws principle criminal anarchy provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.955" offset="6843225">And then it goes on to say that they've changed the law because of Pennsylvania against Nelson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.114" offset="6859839">In other words, the legislature decided that supersedure had taken place and that the legislature had a right to legislate about state sedition but not about national sedition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.384" offset="6912920">And then the little note maker says concededly an offense of limited utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.342" offset="6940714">Alright, now this happened in 1965 but this law was only going to be effective on September 1, 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.266" offset="6972479">So we aren't really dealing with this law except Judge Friendly did talk about it in his opinion saying that even if -- that we shouldn't be worried about this particular action because these defendants were -- could be -- there was a constitutional statute now that they could be charged against -- it could be charged against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.886" offset="7078954">But I say that it's quite unusual that you have a -- the legislature amending the statute and then the highest court of the state, as it did in Epton in May of 1967, coming down with the decision saying that the statute which had been amended by the legislature was constitutional before it was amended, even though the legislature didn't think it was amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.779" offset="7186474">And I think that there is again a case of first impression before this Court with regard to the power of a court to keep reinterpreting legislative enactments.</text>

            <text syncTime="2038.808" offset="8258644">And I want to bring the Court's attention to what the District Attorney said it was necessary to charge the defendants here with the crime of anarchy along with the other 42 counts of gun possession because the District Attorney had to show the element of intent, and what does he say in the various press releases which are part of the papers in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.922" offset="8379016">These are -- this is what the District Attorney in this prosecution thinks the defendants were doing “RAM, which was dedicated to the overthrow of the capitalist system in the United States by violence if necessary.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.621" offset="8429902">Mackell said the arrested RAM members are followers of Chinese premier Mao Tse-Tung and are associated with another Negro organization called Black Americans Unite or Perish.</text>

            <text syncTime="2186.231" offset="8848280">So that in so far as the anarchy aspect of the case is concerned, it has to do with the dissemination of ideas which are unpopular now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.709" offset="8894255">I do not think that this Court can shut its eyes to the fact that the anarchy statute has not been used in New York for anything other, in the 60's and not before that since not the 20's, then to try to proscribe the conduct of black people in expressing ideas which are unpopular.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.380" offset="9000939">And we are faced with the situation where the Court is acting like a super legislature going along with the District Attorney so that it's more than the punishment fitting the crime, but it's the courts in a sort of after arranged approval of the conduct of the prosecution approving a crime to fit the so-called bad conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.650" offset="9133955">Now, there has been a great deal of discussion in this Court about hard core conduct as distinguished from other kind of conduct under the free speech cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.828" offset="9194663">And Judge Friendly, in the court below said that these defendants don't have a prayer in his court, because their conduct was hard core conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.148" offset="9259969">Now, I don't think you can talk about hard core conduct where you have a challenge to a statute that is vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.419" offset="9297063">And this Court held 160 and 160 as fatally vague in the Keyishian case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.575" offset="9329664">Now, you might have hard core conduct in a situation where the statute is overbroad where you say that certain things are enumerated which are bad and other things are mentioned which are of -- which don't -- which are too vague or too broad and should not be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.219" offset="9428198">But here there is nothing that these defendants did with regard to the anarchy counts that it seems to me is not protected by the First Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="4013.296" offset="16156505">If as Commander Foster tried to do, the serviceman seeks to register his car in his home state, generally the home state will seek to impose a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="4023.893" offset="16198928">The other thing which comes to the potential of double taxation which is also within the purposes of this statute is that ultimately, we would -- I'd assume the serviceman is going home.</text>
            <text syncTime="4039.019" offset="16259427">And when he goes home he brings back his property with him whatever he's acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="4043.282" offset="16276459">And at that time, he is going to be subjected to a use tax on this property.</text>
            <text syncTime="4048.213" offset="16296208">And this is the point in time when double taxation is almost certain.</text>
            <text syncTime="4052.965" offset="16315225">I suggest really in terms of potential for double taxation, this ought to be compared to the structure of the ad valorem taxation.</text>
