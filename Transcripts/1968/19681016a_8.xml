            <text syncTime="44.043" offset="281642">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.324" offset="298674">This is a case arising originally in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri where the defendant petitioner was tried and convicted and sentenced to a term of three years imprisonment and a fine for violation of the so-called Interstate Racketeering Act, Section 1952 of Title 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.652" offset="400029">Numerous points were raised upon appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and there were two hearings held in the United States Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.922" offset="441093">A reversal was first obtained on a search and seizure question.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.535" offset="459588">The government then petitioned for rehearing, which was granted, and, upon the rehearing before the Court and bank, the decision of the District Court was affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.473" offset="507340">We then applied petition in this Court for writ of certiorari which was granted on March 4 and, subsequently, it was granted generally and, subsequently in May, that order was limited to the search and seizure question.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.335" offset="570765">The problems in the area of search and seizure, the Fourth Amendment problem which appears in this case, may really be broken down into three separate issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.965" offset="609322">Number one, as to the validity of the search warrant insofar as there being probable cause for its issuance, number two, with reference to a time delay in its execution and, number three, with reference to items which were seized upon the execution of the search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.246" offset="694376">The affidavit, in support of the search warrant, was made by a special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation before the United States Commissioner and set forth a number of instances over a 12-day period, during which the petitioner was seen to be crossing and interstate bridge leading from the State of Illinois to the State of Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.606" offset="783820">There was also an indication that the petitioner had a reputation among law enforcement agents as a gambler.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.784" offset="820600">There was an indication in this affidavit concerning two telephones at a particular apartment which the petitioner, on these -- on some of these 12 days, was seen to enter.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.958" offset="873263">And finally, and this I think is the crux of the issue involving the probable cause, finally, the affidavit concluded the FBI had been informed by a confidential -- excuse me, I better say, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has been informed by a confidential reliable informant that William Spinelli is operating a handbook and accepting wagers and disseminating wagering information by means of the telephones which have been assigned the numbers, and they specified the same numbers which had been indicated earlier in the affidavit as being at this particular apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.917" offset="1025087">It is our belief that, primarily, based upon the Aguilar case, there are no underlying circumstances to substantiate the hearsay information which was given to the Commissioner in this affidavit, and that because it was not substantiated, because there was no underlying corroboration, because there was nothing to show the credibility of the alleged informant, that the affidavit was bad and, therefore, the search warrant was improperly issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.794" offset="1168551">We believe, if the Court please, that -- merely to say that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has received information, has been informed by a confidential reliable informant, that the petitioner was engaging in a handbook operation, does not corroborate itself and that there was nothing by virtue of the travel in interstate commerce, there was nothing by virtue of the telephones being in the estab -- in the apartment, there was nothing by virtue of the petitioner's reputation which substantiated that.</text>
