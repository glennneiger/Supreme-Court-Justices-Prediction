            <label>Mr. Arthur Kinoy</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">Were wholly unsupported by the facts themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.246" offset="137362">They’ve talked of willful contemptuous a conduct in the part of the petitioner towards the Courts of the State New York, and on April 11th of this year, the appellate division of this Court’s to State of New York, revoked, resented, and vacated the judgment of criminal contempt against the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.527" offset="230463">They talked of alleged improper use of committee funds and yet, Mr. Hayes, himself the chairman of the committee which had previously investigate said on the Floor of the House, in supporting the admission of the petitioner without any qualifications this time, he pointed out that when these supposed facts were submitted to a tribunal which has the power to investigate a grand jury, the grand jury refused to return any bill of indictment whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.673" offset="375077">This illustrates the profundity of the founder’s insistence that this rock of protection be written.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.159" offset="417081">Now, the respondents have a great difficulty with this constitutional of analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.210" offset="437248">They have difficulty with the writings and thinking of Professor Warren, who after lifetime scholarly expertise came to the conclusions which we have here advanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.058" offset="496598">Did they suggest that Professor Warren through his lifetime of experience did not have the same time to examine the sources of history which turns this to the respondents that had.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.612" offset="542887">We don't have to pause long on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.182" offset="549157">This Court has time and time again relied only in Bond against Floyd on the expertise of Professor Warren.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.962" offset="572249">Think of difficulty with Madison and Hamilton and they suggest that the Federalist Papers are after all only special pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.485" offset="618329">Well, we do not have to pause long with that contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.445" offset="630136">This Court has characterized the Federalist Papers time and time again as the most authoritative evidence of the intention of the founders.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.818" offset="663677">They have difficulty with the constitutional opinion of their own Select Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.445" offset="690218">We point out in our brief that there own Select Committee said, the House had no constitutional power to exclude Mr. Powell.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.002" offset="724386">They have difficulty with the opinion of the most dominant constitutional authority in the House, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.975" offset="756255">They have difficulty with this Court's decision in Bond against Floyd which proceeds on the assumption that the statements of Madison and Hamilton meant what they said.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.737" offset="807351">So, they suggested this Court that it's a position and thinking in Bond against Floyd is mere dictum.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.114" offset="848833">Having these difficulties, the respondents reached back into history for precedent to explain that Madison and Hamilton did not mean what they said.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.590" offset="898779">That the founders in fact intended to allow some sort of inherent power in the legislature to exclude otherwise duly qualified representatives of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.048" offset="940575">Upon the legislatures own notion of unfixed but what is extraordinary is that there entire constitutional edifice rests upon a precedent that they grasped from history, what is the precedent?</text>
            <text syncTime="224.630" offset="1002956">The Wilkes case, the exclusion of John Wilkes by the British Parliament and Blackstone's rationale in justification for the parliament reaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.579" offset="1042662">They say that since American lawyers were schooled in Blackstone as we all know.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.196" offset="1061157">The founders must have adopted his justification for the action of the British parliament in excluding Wilkes.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.745" offset="1087384">But I suggest to the Court this is fantastic that it turns history upon its head that the Wilkes case was the very lesson, Madison said in Philadelphia was what we must prevent in the New Republic in this Republic.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.016" offset="1148510">And Blackstone's justification for the action of the British Parliament upon which their entire constitutional case rests.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.852" offset="1179752">They do not inform the Court, was first of all not included in this first commentaries he was very embarrass on the Floor of parliament when he appeared as a special plea therefore the majesty's government to justify the Wilkes exclusion when his own commentaries were read against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.469" offset="1242237">So, he revise his opinion to justify the Wilkes exclusion and he was then attacked on both sides of the Atlantic by the leading spokesman for the colonial courts as evidencing the precise theory of legislative tyranny which the colonist were rising against.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.161" offset="1321023">Then, we have set forth with the court's convenience in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.342" offset="1337741">The famous “Junius” papers which repudiate that Blackstone position but most important of all, the Blackstone position was repudiated by the parliament itself when it expunge the Wilkes exclusion resolution, five years before the Philadelphia convention when it expunge it as what, as subversive of the rights of the electorate of the British Isles.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.731" offset="1443276">And finally, the Blackstone opinion is not even considered English law today.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.653" offset="1470966">As Professor Holdsworth in his most dominant history of the British English law sets out.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.404" offset="1498028">So, I suggest the respondent's entire constitutional argument is based upon theories and actions of the British parliament of George III which were at the very core of American opposition, the British league -- legislative tyranny at this has at least proven to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.053" offset="1584650">The wisdom of Mr. Justice Holmes comments that at page of history worth the volume of logic.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.581" offset="1622685">But I suggest to the Court that this understanding that the founders insisted that the legislature was to have no power to refuse the seat and otherwise duly qualified representative of the people is the key to the question of justiciability and is the key to the question of the role of this Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.816" offset="1695619">In this case as in Baker-Carr, non-justiciability had become little more than a play in words.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.052" offset="1728637">For Baker-Carr teaches that the test of non-justiciability in the political question doctrine is deciding whether a manner has been in anyway committed by the Constitution to another branch of government or whether the action of that branch succeeds, whatever authority has been committed, or Justice Harlan pointed out his opinion in Baker-Carr that it's quite necessary to cut through the thick of discussion about justiciability and get to the point as to whether complaint discloses the violation of our federal constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.481" offset="1858309">This inquiry the Court has thought us all in Baker-Carr, requires a delicate exercise in constitutional interpretation and it is the responsibility of this Court as the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution to make it.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.470" offset="1926228">This is the key to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.680" offset="1939080">The question as to who may be the freely chosen representatives of the people has not been confronted by the Constitution to the exclusive control of the legislature quite to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.572" offset="1990698">It has been confided by the Constitution to the ultimate branch of government, the sovereign people.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.940" offset="2024135">In the written document they established as their fundamental law.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.837" offset="2043779">This is because the fundamental process itself of representative government requires that the free choice of the people's representatives remain with the people, subject only to the qualifications they themselves lay down in their Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.232" offset="2109294">So, under the teachings of the Court in Baker-Carr, this is a case in which judicial power must be exercised with the action of the legislatures exceeded the authority committed to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.932" offset="2160076">It is suggested that relief here would violate separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.780" offset="2183481">The contrary is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.261" offset="2193408">Relief here is required to preserve the powers reserved to the sovereign people by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.469" offset="2226322">This is the most historic role of this Court and the words of the Chief Justice in Marbury are decisive here.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.506" offset="2266446">And his question is the question, we must all answer to what purpose or powers limited and to what purposes is that limitation committed to writing, if these limits may at any time be passed by those intended to be restrained.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.032" offset="2332484">And let me speak frankly at this point, what is that the heart of the reluctance of the Lower Courts to grant relief here?</text>
            <text syncTime="565.602" offset="2366757">It is the fear of a confrontation with the House, but this fear in itself unreal since in the words of this Court, it is an inadmissible suggestion that the House would not accept this Court's role as the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.517" offset="2446482">This fear would paralyze the Court in its most important function to preserve a rule of law, the foundation stone of which is a written Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.743" offset="2495384">A fear to act here because respondents have power would in the Chief Justice's words in Marbury subvert the very foundations of all written constitutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.047" offset="2556615">At another priceless point in the history of this Court, this Court said in Cooper against Aaron that Marbury declared the basic principle that the federal judiciary is supreme in the exposition of the law of the Constitution and that this principle has been respected by this Court and by the country as a permanent and indispensable feature of our constitutional system.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.366" offset="2689839">The reaffirmation of that this is a government of laws and not men that represented of government means that ultimate power remains with the people is particularly necessary when the crisis arises in a context in which black citizens are denied the right to elect their own black representative who had reason to great heights of legislative leadership.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.378" offset="2813868">It is difficult indeed to demand law and order of American citizens if the legislative branch itself denies the first assumptions of an ordered society.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.621" offset="2870920">The right of people to govern themselves, thus, to grant relief here would not only be to reaffirm the fundamentals of a representative government but it would reaffirm the fact, that the principles of populous sovereignty are equally applicable to citizen's black and white.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.858" offset="2999860">Such a decision in Justice Clark's words concurring in Baker-Carr would be in the greatest tradition of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.528" offset="3066525">Professor Reid will continue the argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="750.228" offset="3105290">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.911" offset="3140086">We've attempted to argue in our brief in orally.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.091" offset="3156804">First the Congress did not have the power to exclude Congressman Adam C. Powell and what it did and how he did it raise further constitutional objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.883" offset="3207899">In the outset, the two judges in the Court of Appeals tried to treat this matter of expulsion -- treat this matter of exclusion as a matter of expulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.629" offset="3270907">And have it clearly that should be laid to rest in the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.454" offset="3294208">When Congress was organized -- when the House organized on January 3, 1969, the very same resolution which had been proposed in March 1, 1967, the subject matter of our discussion here, the same resolution was proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.341" offset="3357738">The speaker was called upon to read to rule on whether or not a motion to exclude with germane to expel, with germane to his seating our motion to exclude in which the Speaker wrote with January 3rd that such a motion was not germane that on the seating of the congressman.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.674" offset="3455122">The only question opens to the House with the three qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.408" offset="3478006">Also, the speaker wrote on March the 1st that since this was a question of seating that the necessary vote was a majority vote and not the two-thirds which would have been required if it had been a matter of expulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.366" offset="3553865">The justice's below suggests that this is an immaterial distinction since the vote was large enough to satisfy the two-thirds requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.795" offset="3607573">What we argue here is that of course, the motives of the members of the House in voting cannot be inquired into determine how they would have voted where the issue expulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.606" offset="3678835">But more fundamentally, this was at the bottom and grounded on the Precedents of the House as demonstrated in the speaker under the later wrote in this January 3, 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.442" offset="3742156">These precedents dictated that the speakers earlier ruling that the vote was on exclusion because the House could not expel for conduct in a previous session and it was no question as the conduct alleged here in had taken place in Congres's previous to 90th of Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="955.778" offset="3927521">In which he gives -- he said that he anticipated.</text>

            <text syncTime="993.735" offset="4079344">There is however, a great distinction involved in judicial standard sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.560" offset="4098675">If the -- on the question of judging an election and seating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.003" offset="4124379">Of course, the House exercises judicial power there but this Court has been very clear in a number of cases and saying that, when the House is exercise -- the House are in, they're exercising their powers or in expulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.139" offset="4184984">That this is a judicial power of the highest order requiring the greatest amount of due process protections in the adversary sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.721" offset="4227302">So, for an additional judicial reason, sir, we believe that this role that this exclusion -- the expulsion could not be -- the exclusion could not be treated as expulsion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1078.879" offset="4419877">Certainly, the House has power to deal with a member and the member elect and the way in which it may not deal with a general member of the societies so far as the bill of attainder is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.231" offset="4477346">Its judicial power there to seat and to remove one who has been seated, however, where one was never seated and punishment was legislative as it was here after a legislative finding and at no time with any resemblance of due process hearing held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.859" offset="4567834">We contend then that such the manner in which this was accomplished in the House violates first the due process while this substantively and procedural requirements and in addition that it amounts to a bill of attainment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.393" offset="4633976">At the beginning of this matter in the 90th of Congress, when Congressman Powell was asked to step aside, the Hayes Committee had concluded its report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.688" offset="4703148">The Hayes Committee, Committee on Administration had been directed by a resolution which is in the Hayes report at pages -- at page 4 had been directed by the resolution to investigate the various committees of the House and the various numbers of a House into regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.288" offset="4797503">There was nothing in this resolution was specify, any particular committee, any particular committee chairman or any particular member of the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.631" offset="4830939">Nevertheless, the committee proceeded to investigate only one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.571" offset="4862704">Congressman Powell was invited to attend the Hayes Committee, in which he declined at page 84 that levy in the same report as included at which he was not an unconditional declination by in which he suggest that the Committee that a charge to investigate other committees and other people in Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.594" offset="4954760">And as soon as the Committee had done this, he would be glad to appear now, this position who has asserted by the very reason that he was entitled to know whether or not this was preferential treatment as to him, in order to lay an equal predicate if necessary in the House or in the Courts if the matter had been raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.407" offset="5057996">Now, he was denied this opportunity and then when the Select Committee was formed and directed to investigate and to report back on the seating of the Congressman, the Select Committee declined to have an adversary hearing and that one thing that's clear in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.146" offset="5136990">It is the Chairman Celler's position and the position of the Committee that this was not an adversary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.874" offset="5175860">As a result, he was not afforded the rights of an adversary hearing and therefore, the findings are mere legislative findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.827" offset="5215671">And I think the affect of such findings are clearly illustrated by the January 3rd proceeding in the House in 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.424" offset="5270110">Where even though these facts are not refuted anywhere because we didn't have adversary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.565" offset="5298636">They have been completely repudiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.433" offset="5314100">Mr. Hayes who was chairman of the Subcommittee on Administration, pointed not only that they had -- they didn't found insufficient by grand jury but he said, “They are insufficient for us to act on, the way we find facts in the House,” he said, “in no basis upon which to predicate this kind of action.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.394" offset="5393930">Gentleman, Mr. Hayes made that statement himself in the record on January 3rd.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.280" offset="5413470">So, the first predicate of the House's action, the Hayes report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.955" offset="5444190">The second predicate, the proceedings in the New York Court have both been the support of these have been withdrawn from the House's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.684" offset="5491106">In addition, the House reported to furnish Congressman Powell for his contumacious conduct toward the select Committee and that contumacious conduct where they refuse over to participate in a legislative hearing to determine whether or not he should be seated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.772" offset="5555472">For -- so, for exercising his constitutional right as the Court pointed out this morning in the decision in the resident requirement cases, he was being punished then for asserting a constitutional right and that's impermissible whether the assertion is good or bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.639" offset="5638959">Beyond this he was denied all of the procedure work guaranties and for a very good reason, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.711" offset="5707191">For the very inception of this matter, Mr. Powell would notify that the Select Committee would investigate, “Into his official misconduct since 1961.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.105" offset="5760794">Of course, that's a frightening suggestion to most people but this -- it was open ended and to the day in which he had assumed the chairmanship of this committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.318" offset="5809695">At the time he assumed this chairmanship of this committee, there was great question raised in the House and addressed to the speaker as to whether or not Mr. Powell would be elected by the House as Chairman of this committee, since he was then the senior person or would he be avoided because of his race and of course, he was re-elected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.449" offset="5890152">And what relevance other than this that the notice of his official misconduct to date of his taken on the chairmanship has -- I do not know.</text>

            <text syncTime="1688.040" offset="6856579">The House has suggested that the seating of Congressman Powell on January 3, 1969 had mooted this controversy to which we take issue in our memorandum in our position in which we contained narrow to argue that the manner had not been come moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.549" offset="6938603">One, because this is continuous conduct, the kind of continuous conduct that we had complained about in the original suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.545" offset="6970577">And on January the 3rd 1969 when the motion which finally passed -- the motion which finally passed seating him carried the findings from the 90th Congress with no question whether the same punishment, the same conduct, the same activity was the basis of the discriminatory action which took place on January 3, 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.267" offset="7073499">In addition, we take the further position that the House could not moot this case by further unconstitutional conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.278" offset="7129506">Therefore, in order for this Court to determine that this case had been mooted by the January 3rd action of the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.018" offset="7160435">This Court would have to find that the January 3rd resolution which seated him on condition of paying of fine and other limitations whether that action of the House was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.164" offset="7237026">In addition to the continuing conduct, obviously as the Court suggested in Bond case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.195" offset="7257192">We have a question of the backpay from the two years in which he was not allowed to seat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.650" offset="7286972">An amount I think estimated by the chairman of -- Mr. Chairman Celler, as $55,000.00 but in addition, this resolution which a levy to fine upon him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.923" offset="7356040">Thereby adding the resolution of January 3rd seated him were clearly and then the -- against the pleadings of the leadership of the House, Mr. Albert, Mr. Celler, mention just a few Your Honor, all suggested that the House would not punish him prior to seating him because to do so was to add to the qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.811" offset="7455619">Mr. Kinoy has pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.555" offset="7462619">And now the House is now in position of the respondent is that this further illegal conduct moots this controversy to which we take exception and press before you that this matter is not moot, ready for the decision and should be decided in order to cover to the matter of backpay as well as the other punishment position provisions of the resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.667" offset="7579021">Now, as to remedy because the big stone in Bond in this case all along has been the remedy aspect, and whether the Court could enforce its mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.363" offset="7641819">I think the difficult in our position since you agree to took the outset, a mandamus was proper and that we were entitled to mandamus from Marbury, to the case of Marbury down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.986" offset="7700334">I think the fact that the Congressman had been seated however, removes his difficulty considerably.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.848" offset="7723739">The -- therefore, I think the remedy problem becomes much, much easier to handle and to direct here in terms of declaring the Resolution 278 and of March 1, 1967, and the resolution of January 3, 1969 unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="2173.947" offset="8800193">They – there are at least four undisputed matters before us to which my two friends have made scant attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.856" offset="8855782">First as this Court is fully aware, this is an action against the members of the House questioning their action in there official capacity as petitioners emphatic announce below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.052" offset="8940628">Here, we are suing the legislative branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.993" offset="8964347">This action then is not an action against private parties or against the United States with its consent to secure the declaration of unconstitutionality of a statute passed by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.249" offset="9041356">It is directed solely to the members in their capacity as members of the House and three of their agents who acted within the House pursuant to the command of the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.827" offset="9111677">It is our view that this Court does not have the power to entertain this action against the members any more than it would have the power to order the members to pass or repeal a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.323" offset="9189731">Second, there is no dispute now as to the correctness of the findings made by the Select Committee of the 90th Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.961" offset="9248246">To the effect that Mr. Powell misappropriated large sums of government funds that he was in civil and criminal contempt at the time of the action of the New York Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.436" offset="9322120">That he maintained unlawfully an improper person on his congressional payroll and that he refused to cooperate in a perfectly proper investigation of his conduct, conducted by two committees, one of the 89th Congress and one of the 90th.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.885" offset="9423893">Now, the serious charges against Mr. Powell were not denied by him at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.924" offset="9464121">They were not denied by him before the committees which investigated him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.959" offset="9488259">They were not denied by him at the time the House convened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.157" offset="9509052">Now, considered the matter and reach its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.466" offset="9526293">They were not denied by him in the compliant which was filed two years ago.</text>

            <text syncTime="2444.637" offset="9882917">It does not even suggest that such an allegation would be supported.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.574" offset="9910711">Accordingly, I say it has no proper place in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.218" offset="9933281">Fourthly, the action of the House of the 91st Congress, the present Congress in fining Mr. Powell $25,000.00 and depriving him of his seniority, likewise, is not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.072" offset="10012693">The action of the 91st House is not challenged in the compliant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.782" offset="10039547">The parties to any such claim that is the members of the present Congress and their agents are not parties to this action in their capacity as members of this Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.660" offset="10095031">The moreover, this Court I submit it does not have original jurisdiction to hear any such claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.433" offset="10126169">And so, the precise question as we see it is whether any Court in a suit against the members of the House of the 90th Congress can review a decision of those members acting pursuant to their constitutional powers to judge the qualifications of their own members to exclude the member elect solely for reasons of personal misconduct and that's all Mr. Powell was excluded for here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2652.207" offset="10713192">It is completely de minimis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.720" offset="10723328">He was paid up to March 1, 1967, the date on which he was expelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.469" offset="10746316">He was re-elected very promptly and he could have prevented himself to the House in April of the same year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.888" offset="10791978">And as the speaker said, twice the matter would be considered again in light of the very important new factor that he had been re-elected as it was last January but Mr. Powell chose to stay away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.511" offset="10866479">He never presented himself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2950.882" offset="11907929">The reason he didn't get his salary after April 1967 until January 1969 was because he never presented himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.575" offset="11950665">He never asked the House to reconsider in the light of the important fact that he had been overwhelmingly re-elected in Harlem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.462" offset="12014195">Now, I submit that there are at least five separate reasons why his demands for relief cannot be granted and I'd like to summarize them briefly before I start to discuss it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.877" offset="12071873">In the first place, although, we haven't heard any mention of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.466" offset="12090264">Article I Section 5, the Speech or Debate Clause affirmatively barged any Court from questioning members of the House or their agents with respect to actions taken by them within the House such as the exercise of their constitutional power to judge the qualifications of one of their members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.304" offset="12189633">Second, I don't think Federal Courts have any subject matter jurisdiction here because Article I Section 5 assigns the sole adjudicatory power to the House by declaring that the House is the judge of the qualifications of its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.438" offset="12282107">That delegation of judicial power under Article I, like the power of the trial impeachment if you please is an explicit exception to the general grant of judicial power to the courts under Article III.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.355" offset="12353787">Since the legislative is co-equal with the judicial branch, the judgments which the House makes in this situation in the field allocated to it, i.e. the qualification of its members are exclusive and supreme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.106" offset="12424840">Thirdly, the Court should not proceed in this case because it involves a nonjusticiable political question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.332" offset="12461725">Fourthly, if the courts could review the propriety what the House did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.769" offset="12483459">It is clear that the House acted within its constitutional powers when it excluded Mr. Powell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.256" offset="12513447">But the constitutional power of each House, the judge qualifications is not limited as had has been stated so many times here to the three standing disqualifications of age, citizenship, and inhabitancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.573" offset="12578649">It extends as well to matters of personal misconduct on the fitting a member of the House and even three -- if these three standing disqualifications were exclusive, the House's action in any event would be justified under its expulsion power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.409" offset="12678019">Since the two-thirds vote required for expulsion was obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.407" offset="12709992">And fifthly, assuming that the lower Federal Courts did have the power to rule on the merits of the case, under the circumstances presented here, those courts did not abuse their discretion in declining to grant the extraordinary and discretionary relief prayed for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.260" offset="12793480">Now, I submit that anyone of these five reasons is sufficient to require dismissal of the action.</text>

            <text syncTime="4303.899" offset="17319978">I would make no such distinction sir and there are many, many cases of the legislative practice of excluding felons, perjurers, and we even have some presidents for persons who had been contemptuous of the Court's outside the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="4322.575" offset="17394688">I think that a well-defined legislative common law that came along with this Speech or Debate Clause into the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4335.660" offset="17447037">Well, I was talking about impeachment and I said that I thought that was an analogy because the Speech or Debate Clause applied to impeachment, even though it was on at utterly unconstitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4357.649" offset="17535018">Now, coming to this contention of the petitioners for a moment, as I understand them they say, well, speech or debate may bar the imposition of criminal or civil penalties after the event.</text>
            <text syncTime="4372.042" offset="17592592">But it doesn't forbid the course the kind of relief inherent in an injunction or a writ or declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4382.742" offset="17635328">However, it seems to us that in order to effectuate the immunity afforded by the Speech or Debate Clause, it must apply to injunction, mandamus, or declaratory judgment, of course, it is far simpler to intimidate critical legislators by direct order of a court with its attention -- attended sanctions than it is by the indirect threat of subsequent criminal or civil proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4413.735" offset="17759357">And as I've indicated, I don't believe petitioners have overcome their difficulty by now limiting their prayer to a declaratory judgment because the declaratory judgment is itself I submit in the most direct and positive sense, a questioning of speech or debate taken in the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="4441.371" offset="17869908">Furthermore in this situation, I think there should be a doctrine and probably is that declaratory relief should not lie where the suit for injunction is barred at least by the separation of power's doctrine as it is here for unless declaratory judgment is to feel wholly gratuitous and advisory, and useless act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4471.780" offset="17991534">It must rely for its efficacy upon the willingness of the members to acquiesce in the Court's interpretation of it's -- of the House's powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4484.721" offset="18043256">Thus, insofar as a declaratory judgment would be given force and effect by the member voluntary acquiescence, it would be, I submit as effective and impingement and interference with legislative proceedings as a flat injunction would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="4508.102" offset="18136775">I want to say a word about nonmember agents because in the Dombrowski against Eastland, the court said that the immunity extends to the Sergeant at Arms in this case to the Clerk and the Doorkeeper who are three individual defendants in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4526.175" offset="18209081">And this Court said the immunity extends although it is less absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4532.796" offset="18235622">But it seems to me, of course there the agent of the Senate Mr. Sowerwine was held not protected by the Clause because he is alleged to have conspired down in Louisiana with some people to make an illegal seizure of some papers which Senator Eastland wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4554.894" offset="18324020">Here, the only thing that these three gentlemen did was to obey the command of the House within the House and it seems to me the immunity therefore clearly applies to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4587.608" offset="18454841">I want to say a word about power to judge qualifications and the power to expel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4595.166" offset="18485039">Let's assume for a moment contrary to my basic position that this Court may properly review the action of the House in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4604.239" offset="18521401">I nevertheless say that the action of the House in doing what it did to Mr. Powell was clearly within its constitutional powers for it clearly was within the constitutional grant in my view of the power to judge his qualifications to seat and I had no use my repeating that I do not believe this constitutional disqualifications under more than three of them are exclusive in all that the framers had before them illustration of state constitutions which made this matter clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="4646.673" offset="18691093">I said that the legislature in various states like New Hampshire and Massachusetts had the power to judge the qualifications contained in this Constitution and one of the men who work on the draft of the Constitution came from Massachusetts or New Hampshire that he was fully familiar with his own Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4670.928" offset="18788059">And yet, the framers chose to adopt language not so specifically limited and the reason they did it I think it's because they new fully well and realize and all that to retain the power to purged themselves of dishonest, disgraceful people because of the obligation they owed to the whole nation to have a legislative body made up at least of decent, honorable citizens.</text>

            <text syncTime="6006.685" offset="24131145">There have been some rather unusual statements made in Court this morning which we would like to respond to very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="6014.440" offset="24162179">In the first place, in response to the Chief Justice's question as to the speaker's ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="6022.748" offset="24195406">I called the Court's attention to the fact that in the congressional record for January 3rd H14, the speaker's ruling is set forth in full the speaker ruled that the question as to the punishment of Mr. Powell for act's committed in the 88th or 89th Congress is not germane to the proposition that he now be sworn in.</text>
            <text syncTime="6047.766" offset="24295508">The speaker based this ruling, Mr. Justice White upon the Precedents of the House and contrary to what Judge Bromley had said, the Precedents of the House are full and clear on this question and they start with the case which is most famous in American history.</text>
            <text syncTime="6065.482" offset="24366352">The case of Matthew Lyon in the Fifth Congress which Congressman Lyon was convicted under the Alien and Sedition Act and a motion was made to expel him before the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="6077.306" offset="24413581">The House then composed of gentlemen who had participated in the framing of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="6082.606" offset="24434792">For we debated the issue and came to the conclusion that the House had no constitutional power whatsoever to expel, and mind you, this is under the Expulsion Clause not Exclusion Clause</text>
            <text syncTime="6096.525" offset="24490486">No constitutional power to expel a member for alleged acts occurring prior to his election and in full the Annals of Congress point out that the fundamental reason was the very same reason which Madison and Hamilton advanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="6112.594" offset="24554747">And that is that the ultimate tribunal and to the fitness of a member is not the Congress of the United States but the tribunal it's fitness of a member is his constituency is the people of the United States, the people he represents.</text>
            <text syncTime="6127.504" offset="24614410">The President of the Matthew Lyon case has been followed fully and completely, never deviated once in the five cases on expulsion in the history of the House and for the convenience of the Court, we have set them out info in our reply brief pages 18 through 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="6149.005" offset="24700406">And just as so that there would be no question about that whatsoever, the official historian of the House, Mr. Galloway says in this history of the House of Representative, he concluded that I quote, “In general the House has been dubious of its power to punish members for offenses committed before their election.”</text>

            <text syncTime="6314.573" offset="25362662">Now in Kilbourn itself, the Court held that the resolution of the House of Representatives then before the Court was unconstitutional and void, and held it directly and the relief that flowed from that was the relief which was directed toward this Sergeant at Arms of the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="6345.247" offset="25485333">So, that in the very case which the respondents rely on which supposedly deprives this Court of its historic power of judicial review over actions of the legislature when those actions transcend constitutional boundaries in that very case.</text>

            <text syncTime="6464.875" offset="25963896">It is simply not the analysis of the founding fathers and what I find extraordinary in that height is that the proposition is urged before this Court that the legislative power which the British Parliament asserted in the Wilkes case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6488.888" offset="26059922">One of the most central and decisive causes of our revolution that this power is the power which is the respondents seek to sustain their action upon.</text>

            <text syncTime="6515.123" offset="26164935">Now I have to say one thing, I think it is outrageous that before this Court assertions are made that the petitioner was guilty of certain acts that the petitioner never denied his guilt of certain acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6536.970" offset="26252288">The record has it an ounce of evidence of that and then, I want to make is very clear.</text>

            <label>Mr. Arthur Kinoy</label>
            <text syncTime="6849.180" offset="27501150">Well, the explanation for that I think was best put forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="6852.983" offset="27516301">First one, it was never discussed in the House in the Matthew Lyons case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6856.117" offset="27528840">An explanation was that this went to the fundamental principles of Representative Government because the founders were determined that under no guides whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="6870.712" offset="27587250">The House was the half power of overruling the choice of the people as to who would to be the representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="6879.585" offset="27622776">Now as to unfitness or prior misbehavior, the House specifically discussed this in the Lyons case and said -- because there, they said it was the grossest misbehavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="6888.637" offset="27658930">He was charge with among other things speeding at all the members of the House of Representatives, Matthew Lyons was.</text>
            <text syncTime="6895.471" offset="27686306">And the House there said that it is a fundamental principle of American Representative Government that the Court of resort of last resort as to the fitness of a member is his constituency.</text>
            <text syncTime="6914.073" offset="27760703">When an act is occurred prior to the election, the people have passed on it by electing him and the House may not overrule.</text>
            <text syncTime="6923.910" offset="27799991">To allow the House to overrule it would be to open up the dangerous road which Madison talked of, of subverting the fundamental principles of the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="6935.834" offset="27847743">And the fact is that in this case you would say that it -- that the Representative Powell could not have been expelled for the conduct that's involved in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="6948.064" offset="27896644">I think the constitutional provisions are very clear and the Precedents of the House are very clear on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6955.283" offset="27925483">Finally, I would like to just point out to the Court that in essence, the respondents' position is a challenge to the role of this Court as the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution, that the short answer to the respondents' entire argument can be put no better than Chief Justice Marshall put it in Marbury against Madison.</text>
            <text syncTime="6991.410" offset="28069992">That it is for the judiciary to say what is the law and that is the meaning of a written Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="7003.075" offset="28116699">And to argue a doctrine which says that the legislature can transcend the boundaries placed in the Constitution is to subvert the very meaning of a written Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="7021.549" offset="28190574">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
