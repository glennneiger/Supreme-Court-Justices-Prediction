            <label>Mr. Peter G. Fetros</label>
            <text syncTime="28.557" offset="217631">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.923" offset="227035">My name is Peter G. Fetros, I represent the appellant in this case, Mr. Enrique Perez.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.791" offset="258487">In this case, there was a four-count indictment -- four-count complaint filed against my client concerning three different instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.833" offset="294745">Two of -- the first two counts of the indictment at the trial, the defendant took the stand and testify upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.288" offset="324524">On the third and fourth count which involved one incident which was separate from the first two, the defendant did not make any statement on the stand and upon being cross-examined or attempted to be cross-examined by the District Attorney, his defense attorney raised an objection which was sustained by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.900" offset="402996">Thereafter, there was no further attempt to cross-examine the defendant on a separate instant the third and fourth counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.192" offset="436120">In addition to these three instances, which were involved in the case, there was a collateral crime which was brought into the case on the grounds that it was a similar modus operandi.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.845" offset="490768">The Court allowed the collateral crime to come in but here again there was no cross-examination to the defendant when he was on the witness stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.833" offset="522742">During closing arguments since Griffin had not been decided by this Court, the prosecutor made comment on the fact that the defendant did not testify as to counts three and four nor was he able to cross-examine him concerning counts three and four because the judge had told him that he was not able to cross-examine the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.199" offset="624201">Then, the instruction was given which is the same instruction which is contained in the Griffin case and we have before us now a clear case to determine the scope of the waiver of the privilege of self-incrimination when a person takes to stand in a multi-count indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.247" offset="696404">Now, we have an unusual situation here in one respect that the trial court determined the District Attorney could not cross-examine on counts three and four.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.337" offset="744678">The Supreme Court of the State of California said this was in error that the counts three and four formulated a common plan and design and therefore cross-examination under the California statute was permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.792" offset="802565">It then went on to say that due to the federal decisions which had been rendered in federal cases concerning the scope of the waiver of the privilege that the privilege extended to all that which encompass legitimate cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.739" offset="870379">And the Supreme Court of California therefore held that the man when he took the stand waived his right to self-incrimination as to counts three and four could've been examined by them and could not now complain.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.134" offset="927953">And I say that this is wrong for three reasons and actually for four.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.775" offset="946448">First, the crimes three and four were not specific -- were not a common plan in design by any stretch of the imagination although the Supreme Court held that in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.434" offset="997125">Case which came later now says that the Perez case which is the one on appeal here is to be very limited in scope when determining what is modus operandi.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.668" offset="1038085">The crimes which are charged involved holdups of grocery stores and taverns.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.590" offset="1061700">The collateral crime which was brought in was another holdup of a tavern.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.955" offset="1091166">The timings of the holdups were different.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.261" offset="1100466">There were holdups in the 7 o'clock area.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.231" offset="1108302">There were holdups in the 1:30 area.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.327" offset="1116662">The number of people involved were different.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.656" offset="1125961">The weapons that were used were different ranging from sort of rifles to pistols.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.476" offset="1145292">The descriptions of the people who supposedly committed the crimes were different.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.770" offset="1166503">Therefore, I say that there was not this common plan or design and a cross-examine -- what cross-examination was not permissible at state court level.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.202" offset="1204224">But even if there was a common plan and design in the specific case as other cases have ruled if examination for evidence is admissible for a particular purpose, its probative effect may be outweighed by the amount of prejudice which can be laid in against the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.238" offset="1280293">Now, on these multi-count complaints, the man is on trial for each separate crime that he has charged with.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.298" offset="1308609">He can be punished each separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.867" offset="1318849">He has to -- the District Attorney has to prove each crime separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.101" offset="1339747">Therefore, when a question is asked in cross-examination concerning one of the other two crimes we have the direct situation where the man is -- they're being asked to testify against himself on those particular accounts.</text>

            <text syncTime="532.865" offset="2234807">This Court reversed on the basis that the man could have explained something possibly if he was forced to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.883" offset="2266885">And so here in Perez, maybe the man could have explained something if the objection at which his defense attorney raised was not sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.218" offset="2304293">Instead, what happen, they sustained the objection then they made the improper argument at the end concerning the inferences to be drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.817" offset="2346611">Now, I should make it clear that this last method of finding convictions of three and four of all of the convictions are to be set aside is of course easy way out because I think that time has come for the Court to indicate how much a person waives when he takes the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.412" offset="2424978">Does he waive it as to all cross-examination or does he waive it as to matters which are only within his knowledge?</text>
            <text syncTime="588.759" offset="2458415">Caminetti of course has been quoted time and time again and it's being a case that says that all available relevant cross-examination is allowed and you waive your privilege for self-incrimination to that extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.334" offset="2508675">But that really isn't what its saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.154" offset="2515989">The reason I think that the Court has focused in to the Griffin rule is that the comment and the instructions which are given focused attention to the fact that the man is silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.130" offset="2563845">It's in effect shattering the constitutional right to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.226" offset="2592266">Basically, the man can't testify a lot of these things because he doesn't have in his own knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.812" offset="2622568">There was a companion case in Perez in the lower court level called Ing.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.974" offset="2639287">Now, Mr. -- Dr. Ing was charged with couple counts of rate by the use of drugs and they brought in three collateral crimes with three different people and he wasn't charged in these crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.435" offset="2685158">He had testified those crimes and then they made the comment concerning the fact that he had testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.531" offset="2713475">But what would happen if instead of the Perez case where there was some possible explanation and knowledge on his part in this cross-examination area that the cross -- the specific question he was asked on cross-examination was, why were you so-and-so in his house with the two men immediately after the robbery which occurred in counts three and four.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.501" offset="2801351">If we change the facts just a little tiny bit and say that counts three and four were there and there was no such question.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.271" offset="2836459">Are we to say that because it is a similar crime which I'm not agreeing to but if we say that it's because it's a similar crime the man can be cross-examined as to each one of the elements of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.493" offset="2881390">And I don't think he can because how can he reasonably be expected to know to explain and defend themselves to these elements which are beyond his knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.068" offset="2919633">It isn't that really the thing that we're saying that that the quick-witted or the dull-witted should be made equal that when they're asked the question about where they were at particular time that both can say that we aren't going to answer or rather than try the quick-witted will be able to make something up and the dull-witted will not.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.757" offset="2990373">I think that's the real substance of the Griffin rule and if that is the case, then what I'm saying is that on each count in an indictment or complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.733" offset="3046275">The man should be able not to say anything which is beyond his knowledge on those matters and no inference can be drawn from the fact that he remains silent.</text>

            <text syncTime="750.908" offset="3106983">How can he defend something like that?</text>
            <text syncTime="754.405" offset="3120985">Maybe it is something usually peculiarly within his knowledge but I think that in this day and age everybody realizes that unless something unusual happens, he is not going to remember what happened on that particular day.</text>

            <text syncTime="1184.096" offset="4839737">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.210" offset="4860217">We have the California comment rule here again to day but under much different circumstances and presented in Griffin and in the Chapman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.929" offset="4911104">In Griffin, as you recall the defendant did not testify and it was there held that that part of the comment rule of California which permitted comment by the prosecutor and a standard instruction by the Court cut down and violated his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.124" offset="5027819">Now, today, we have the other side of the coin as it were of our comment rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.855" offset="5046836">Our California Constitution permits comment in those situations as here where he does take the stand and fails to explain evidence -- fails to explain or deny evidence within his knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.478" offset="5129279">Now, it is respondent's position that the privilege does not apply and the California comment rule is valid here in this situation where he does take the stand but fails to explain or deny facts within his knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.771" offset="5210467">We think this conclusion follows from the proposition and the many cases that by taking the stand voluntarily as here he waives his right -- he waives his privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.912" offset="5295000">The waiver of course under the holding below is not unlimited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.301" offset="5324570">The waiver in this case and in the many federal cases is cited in our brief is determined by the scope of relevant cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.319" offset="5388622">The landmark case of course cited in our brief is Caminetti that has been followed in such leading cases as Johnson versus the United States which is held the waiver the privilege is not limited by the fact that the defendant's answer might tend to establish guilt of a collateral offense for which he could still be prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.049" offset="5491545">Now, this to me seems important does this waiver of the privilege concept conflict in anyway with our comment rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.780" offset="5558523">In other words, to those rules hit head on and I don't think they do when we consider the history and the privilege underlying the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.564" offset="5617664">That was detailed precisely in the Court's Griffin case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.241" offset="5644309">The Court pointed out the two main reasons policy considerations underlying the rule and the first is that not all people have the ability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.590" offset="5709720">However, innocent to withstand the perils of the witness stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.549" offset="5733543">And of course in that situation, the Court noted that comment cuts down on that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.735" offset="5770324">Now, it's really apparent that that's not the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.915" offset="5799058">The petitioner while represented by the counsel, the public defender's office of Sacramento County voluntarily took the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.298" offset="5840541">Now, they must have waive the possibilities of relying upon the presumption of innocence or the advantages of putting forth their versions of the fact and of course after weighing that decision was made to take the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.838" offset="5910758">Another reason given in Griffin is that some defendants, in fact many defendants will not take the stand, not that they can explain the present charge against them but due to the fear of impeachment by prior convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.191" offset="5984110">That reason has no validity here because the petitioner did have prior convictions; they were alleged in the accusatory pleading.</text>

            <text syncTime="1550.595" offset="6305729">Yes, that was waived but on the fear of not taking the stand because of prior convictions that has no validity here because two prior convictions were charged against this petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.146" offset="6391933">He admitted them and one was used for impeachment when he did take the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.158" offset="6415966">So, that fear could not have the third -- the defendant from taking the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.122" offset="6455881">Now, California in this case and in the companion case of People versus Ing on the waiver principle followed the rule that has been followed in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.687" offset="6518157">That is that the waiver extends to permissible or relevant cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.873" offset="6546892">And the court below reason in this case as it did in the companion case of Ing that counts three and four showed a plan, scheme in modus operandi and in view of the general denial as to counts one and two and when you have a general denial cross-examination is extremely wide and goes to his motive, his scheme, his plan that those counts three and four were within the scope of permissible cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.072" offset="6711672">Now, we counsel mentioned that the error of the trial court in over in sustaining the objection to cross-examination and it seems to conclude that some prejudice resulted to the petitioner by that ruling, we contend that that error of the trial court was an error in favor of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.003" offset="6835388">The Johnson case of course points out that where the privilege is claimed when a witness takes his stand if the privilege is claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.015" offset="6879483">And then, and granted as in the Johnson case and then there is comment; of course that's not playing the game quite fairly and there would be prejudice but that was certainly not the situation here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3330.463" offset="13425246">I just want to make one very brief comment and that's the use of the term “cross-examination” by the California Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.780" offset="13458474">It's not being used I don't think in the same sense that we're thinking of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.343" offset="13472789">There's direct examination and then there's cross it's on the direct but they're saying is that there's a further area which makes the defendant the prosecutor's witness and this is the whole area that this thing opens up if we allow this type of theory to stand then in effect on a charged crime the District Attorney can ask any question he wants concerning a charged crime which is similar in modus operandi.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.626" offset="13589922">He can say, “Where were you, what were you doing?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.104" offset="13603819">you know, “How can you explain this?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.421" offset="13609044">Go through the whole thing as if he is in the civil case he was calling the guys an adverse witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.866" offset="13630882">The Supreme Court of California used the term “cross-examination” is proper but it's a little bit different that we normally think of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.094" offset="13663796">The man is on the stand at that time and you're asking him these questions that in effect they're making him -- the District Attorney is making him as his witness to prove elements of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.507" offset="13705383">And if this thing is allowed to stand, they're saying that the District Attorney can elicit from the defendant as to counts three and four all of the necessary elements by asking questions which they say are cross-examination which I say is really just direct examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.277" offset="13776436">They don't have any relationship to the questions which were asked on -- by the defense attorney at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.894" offset="13802977">It could be anything because that's what they're saying.</text>
