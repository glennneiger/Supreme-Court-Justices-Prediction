            <text syncTime="20.631" offset="185866">Mr. Gray, you may proceed with your argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="24.126" offset="199868">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.349" offset="220766">The petitioner below has been completely barred from his statutory right to appeal the criminal conviction against him and this bar has been solely upon the basis of his poverty.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.523" offset="269458">We therefore contend that the case before Your Honors today is on all force or even a stronger case than that presented to this Court in the case of Griffin versus Illinois and following cases in which this Court has held that for decade that the state may not withdraw a right of appeal from a person upon any invidious discrimination such as poverty.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.830" offset="374680">The respondents raised two points, their first point is that there is some adequate alternative method of appeal open to us and their second point is that the Griffin rule should not apply since the offense convicted in this case and appealed from is a petty offense with which we disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.626" offset="457853">In Oklahoma as was the situation in Illinois at the time of Griffin case there are two methods of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.838" offset="482722">There is a short form of appeal which is the clerk's transcript then contains barely the few papers of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.492" offset="517308">It is conceded in respondents' brief at page 8 and it was so held by the trial court that this method of appeal is inadequate in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.174" offset="556074">The second method of appeal available in Oklahoma is the long form which we call a “case-made” and which respondents agree at their brief in page 4 is the method in which the court reporter's transcript evolved with the evidence and all of the proceedings and all of the instruments are made up and presented to the appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.248" offset="644368">Now, turning to their first point, that there is an adequate alternative method the response assert that the defendant should have made up a statement of the evidence for memory in early form and submitted it and I quote from page 8 of their brief, “in lieu of the case-made” and that therefore, we would have an alternate method of appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="394.955" offset="1683205">Now, it is interesting to note that at the hearing on our request for a court reporter's transcript, the trial court held several findings of fact which are lengthy but briefly the important ones are and it is for this reason that we contend this case is stronger than Griffin.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.561" offset="1753631">The trial court held that we have the legal need for the long form of appeal and that the short form is inadequate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1246.842" offset="5090722">The sixth month -- the sixth-month line is result of finding that as I understand that under six months, it's not serious and over six months it is serious but we'll argue that there are more considerations than the mere six-month penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.218" offset="5156237">Your Honor knows well that there's long been discussed, there are two elements, the length of the penalty as well as the seriousness of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.969" offset="5187271">And in the Oklahoma court and other cases cited in our brief in pages 17 and pages 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.039" offset="5211512">For example in 1918, Franks versus Muskogee gets to the point when a defendant is convicted of an offense carrying a maximum offense, a $25.00 fine is the maximum penalty and this Court held, I mean the Oklahoma court held that in any regard to ordinance violations, any crime in which carries imprisonment is an essential part of the tribunal and in this case that I'm mentioning to you, the defendant could be jailed for failing to pay a fine which emphasizes my point that if there's one day of imprisonment, in Oklahoma that's a serious crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.539" offset="5373576">Ex parte Monroe also pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.098" offset="5383816">It's another Oklahoma case cited in our brief, that it was never contemplated that a police court which is not a court of record could try crimes involving incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.032" offset="5427493">Now, there are precedents in this Court, Callan versus Wilson, was $25.00 fine and a 30-day imprisonment penalty and in 1888, this Court held that was serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.347" offset="5472737">In the case of District of Columbia versus Colts, the charge is reckless driving which we think to be a lesser including offense and the Court held that that was indictable under the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.952" offset="5519130">It was shocking to the general moral sense and state cases have since continued that evaluation of the charge of reckless driving to be a serious offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="2075.297" offset="8404511">Part of his transcript would have to have been in narrative form because these people did not testify in the trial -- in the case at trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.547" offset="8449546">The reporter could not have been included it in the case-made, so if he can present his case to the Court of Criminal Appeals on a partial reporter's transcript, on a partial narrative statement of evidence by way of affidavit, we don't think that he would be prejudiced by presenting at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.114" offset="8527809">Now this was not a complicated case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2171.423" offset="8789034">However, I have quoted a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.002" offset="8799378">It's an old Oklahoma case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.945" offset="8807111">It's Harris versus State in which the Court of Criminal Appeals had this to say, if for any reason stenographer's notes could not be obtained, then it was the duty of such lawyers to use their best exertion to make up the case-made from memory and if they failed to do so, the defendant would be held responsible for this neglect of duty on their part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.890" offset="8898957">See also Dove versus State, the writer of this opinion practice law many years in Texas before court stenographers were known to that state and when the law -- when it went under the law, the evidence had to be written out as a matter of memory by the attorneys and filed in Court within ten days from the adjournment of the term of Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.474" offset="8973249">The writer never had the least difficulty in preparing his statements of the evidences in his cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.026" offset="8995506">And he knows from personal experience that it can easily be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.293" offset="9008567">In fact, he seriously doubts that the employment of court stenographers is at all necessary either in the administration of justice up to the development of lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.033" offset="9043466">It has a tendency to breed carelessness on their part but be that as it may, the trial court has a large discretion as to when to order the stenographer's note be extended without expense to the defendant.</text>
