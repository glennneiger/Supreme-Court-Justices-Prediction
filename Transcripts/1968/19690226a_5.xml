            <text syncTime="1538.622" offset="6257873">I think it's interesting that the Government in its argument actually resisted on the application Boyd to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.272" offset="6292459">Yet, almost from the inception, the argument here yesterday, the Government relied on Boyd as authorizing seizure of these moneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.043" offset="6339584">Last night, I went to Boyd and studied it very carefully.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.113" offset="6355780">I wanted to determine what was the source of this argument that was made yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.770" offset="6378454">I could only find a possible reference at page 623 of the Boyd opinion where the court was detailing antecedent history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.242" offset="6416384">In considering the statute that made it mandatory upon order of court for a man to deliver his private books and papers to determine whether or not he had paid the proper duties, the Supreme Court in Boyd said even the obnoxious writs of assistance didn't go this far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.102" offset="6503737">They said, there when they entered into warehouses, unto ships, they at least were looking for stolen property or property which no duty had been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.929" offset="6555042">This they said was not as bad as what the contested statute in Boyd did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.745" offset="6578343">However, that court was not endorsing writs of assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.098" offset="6591718">It was merely say that this statute was even worse than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.499" offset="6605406">It was saying that writs of assistance is obnoxious as they were, were not compelling a man's testimony against himself out of his own mouth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.234" offset="6648351">At least according to the Boyd case, the writs of assistance allowed search for well, what was actually contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.510" offset="6689416">And in that sense, they weren't as bad as the -- a compelling a self-incrimination by a person's prior papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.028" offset="6727450">But as I said -- private papers -- but as I say, they were not endorsing searches in violation of the Fourth Amendment, nor can the Government here convert the words from Boyd into an endorsement of violation of the Fifth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.818" offset="6786696">The Government's invocation of Boyd yesterday on argument, I submit, is both time-wise inappropriate and content-wise inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.629" offset="6837896">It is clear I think from our argument that we rely on Boyd and submit to this Court that the decision of the Seventh Circuit can only be reversed if Boyd is overruled and abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.625" offset="6905919">The Government proposes to this Court that this forfeiture is remedial and not punitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.528" offset="6953462">I'm not really entirely sure I understand this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.103" offset="6963806">I wasn't sure when I receive the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.297" offset="6976554">If as I think it does, punitive means punishment for a wrong, then remedial as used here would seem to mean to compensate for a wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.612" offset="7017827">If that's the argument, I submit to this Court, it must be rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.750" offset="7038412">The occupational tax, this as the Court knows, $50.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.800" offset="7054608">The forfeiture here is over $8,600.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.331" offset="7068714">It would seem that the sheer discrepancy between the amounts would defeat the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.968" offset="7091284">But even if that does not happen, I think the practicalities of the matter should.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.966" offset="7111241">This $50.00 tax and the penalties and the interest that accrue on it have already been assessed independently by the Government and they have been collected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.572" offset="7157635">The Government's own actions and -- an independent assessment in collection reject the possibility that the seizure here is compensatory rather than punitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.649" offset="7213955">I submit they are clearly punitive and therefore they are quasi criminal contrary to what the Government proposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2005.298" offset="8124583">I was totally unprepared for it, but I would submit that this is not a very learned argument coming at somewhat as rather surprised that this really personal for the cost of investigation appears to have no equality, the case that follows this is we have to say 300,000 compensatory for the cost of investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.905" offset="8239000">Here for some reason, 8,600 is compensatory for the cost of investigation under their argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.655" offset="8265958">It -- rather what surprises me that in criminal cases, where cost of investigations of this type are made at least have never been assessed as valid cost, and I don't see how validly these monies can be seize and say were compensating the Government for the use of their agents or whatever it might be.</text>

            <text syncTime="2082.761" offset="8434395">As to their in rem argument, the Government has argued that subject -- property subject to forfeiture enjoys no privilege against self-incrimination which can be asserted to prevent their forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.265" offset="8508479">They say that this is an in rem proceeding brought against the property itself and it may not avail itself of the owner's privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.729" offset="8546304">We submit to this Court that this argument was refused long ago in the Boyd case, which rejected any argument that the technical character of a forfeiture as an in rem proceeding against the property had any effect on the right of the owner of the property to assert as a defense violation of his constitutional rights, and the court recognized this owner -- the court in Boyd recognized the owner as a substantial party to the in rem suit, and therefore in a position to raise violations of his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.809" offset="8722578">I might say at this time that the case on which -- well which the United States urged was in conflict with this case, wherein the Deans are claimants in its something against a 19 something.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.457" offset="8801155">Their case differs substantially in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.858" offset="8814843">Here, we have a man who is recognized as an owner by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.940" offset="8835114">The Boyd case says as an owner recognized is a substantial party and has right to raise his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.718" offset="8870222">I think it's very important to recognize that in the Dean case, the trial court found that the Deans the claimants were not the owners of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.854" offset="8918810">Therefore actually, the Deans would have no standing in that lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.250" offset="8948381">Their claim as owner was rejected by the findings of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.240" offset="8964368">I think that's a substantial difference between their case and this and I thought I would like to bring it to the Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.853" offset="9006791">There is one basic difference, I might say, while we rely on Boyd, I mean we rely on Plymouth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.813" offset="9038660">There's a basic difference between those cases and this one at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.579" offset="9053706">In those cases, the typical point was the prohibition in choosing in a forfeiture case, evidence illegally assert -- secured from the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.486" offset="9097279">Here, we have kind of the other side of the coin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.097" offset="9111803">We -- they claim forfeiture of property because the owner refused or omitted to give evidence against himself in violation of his constitutional rights, because if he had waived his constitutional rights, there would be no forfeiture here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.976" offset="9183274">The rational of this forfeiture action is the -- the forfeiture of property for invoking the constitutional privilege, and I submit to this of course in the true sense of the word, this makes the constitutional privilege what has been used so often, this makes it cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.438" offset="9281076">The Government makes a further argument that in the abstract, an owner could be entirely innocent of any wrongdoing or illegality and the property would still be subject to forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.987" offset="9335306">And in the abstract, that can be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.029" offset="9351502">But here, necessary to forfeiture is the illegal intent of the possessor, and this Court in One 1958 Plymouth versus Pennsylvania made that eminently clear the difference between properties that are forfeitable per se and properties that require proof of the use in order for them to become forfeitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.467" offset="9477204">Now, and it pointed out that when dealing with articles that are innocent as themselves as the money is here, the articles derive their contraband nature only from the acts or the intent of the possessor or user.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.615" offset="9549824">The act of the intent of Mr. Angelini which is necessary to make this property subject to forfeiture is first the operation of a wagering business which is not illegal under federal law, and secondly, the failure to comply with the registration provisions of 4412 and the payment of the $50.00 under 4411.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.826" offset="9666644">To have on the act, it would under Marchetti require that he incriminate himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.209" offset="9700185">It is our submission most basically that no illegal intent can be inferred from the exercise of, or a refusal to waive constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.837" offset="9750758">It's our position that property can't assume a contraband nature from such exercise or refusal by the possessor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.894" offset="9790986">And if it can't derive a contraband nature from the acts or intent of the possessor, it's not contraband and it is therefore not subject to forfeiture because the proof necessary to the derivative forfeiture has failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.655" offset="9890043">I submit therefore that none of the Government's arguments are going to suffice to forfeit these goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.309" offset="9920658">I submit that the decision of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.154" offset="9948035">We then come to the aspect of this case that was not presented to the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.786" offset="9978546">This is the urging by the Government of strict prospective application of the Marchetti-Grosso decisions in forfeiture cases if this Court should determine that they applied forfeiture cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.549" offset="10049599">I would also submit to this Court on that point that the Government has made no argument to encourage this Court validly to employ strict prospective application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.420" offset="10113024">Its own cases and I refer particularly to the case that most relies on Linkletter recognized that the general rule is retroactive application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.428" offset="10157119">It also recognized an exception to that rule where a decision, an earlier decision is overruled as this Court by Marchetti-Grosso overruled character in Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.468" offset="10213230">That rule is that intermediate cases finally decided should not be upset.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.594" offset="10237785">This case of course is not finally decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.584" offset="10253667">This standard of limited applicability refer to by this Court in Linkletter as being appropriate to a circumstance such as we have here is not even considered by the Government on this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.307" offset="10308629">It doesn't enlighten us what if any havoc would ensue where the Marchetti-Grosso decisions made applicable to forfeiture cases or how they would it upset the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.695" offset="10382190">They give us no countervailing considerations which this Court recognized were necessary to strict application of prospective application that would take this case out of the limited retroactivity rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.281" offset="10464528">The Government's whole argument relates to the potentialities of a volume of litigation relating to property forfeited in the past, finally forfeited, and they say that provides a sound and practical reason for this Court to apply prospective application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.625" offset="10553866">It pays no attention to cases not finally decided such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.984" offset="10571316">It gives no reason by this Court to not declare limited retroactivity in accordance with the rule pronounced in Linkletter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.588" offset="10601723">We submit the rule should be employed to cases such as this and finally decided and we further submit that no countervailing considerations have been suggested by the Government for not employing that rule.</text>
