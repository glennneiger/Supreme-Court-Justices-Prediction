            <text syncTime="56.617" offset="329853">One was that its terms are vague and uncertain in meaning, thereby depriving here of due process; The second ground for demur was that the statute discriminates against certain females; that is unmarried females between the ages of 18 and 21 without basis for its support and thereby denying equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.094" offset="415744">On the same day, the demur was filed, the State of Connecticut filed a substitute information alleging two additional charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.864" offset="446777">One was violation of Section 53-219 of the general statutes that statute entitled “lascivious carriage and fornication”, and Section 53-175 of the statutes which is the disorderly conduct statute, the demur was overruled, the plaintiff pleaded not guilty to all charges elected a trial to the Court was found guilty of 17-379, guilty of 53-219, and not guilty of disorderly conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="510.947" offset="2147140">We claim that this is a statute that provides for the deprivation of liberty and therefore the due process provisions of the constitution must apply whether Connecticut chooses to call as remedial or penal.</text>
