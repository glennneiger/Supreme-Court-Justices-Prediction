            <text syncTime="59.496" offset="341347">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.811" offset="354617">This is a civil antitrust case which comes here directly from the Southern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.923" offset="383039">The court below dismissed the Government's complaint which had charged that the defendant's activity has violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.272" offset="420446">The issue presented here is whether or not the antitrust exemption of the Webb-Pomerene Act extends to the procurement of goods under the United States for foreign aid program where the goods are shipped abroad and where the funds to pay for the goods come from the United States Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.934" offset="515114">The facts are all stipulated here and they're not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.317" offset="536639">The defendants below appellees here are five major United States corporations which produce concentrated phosphate and the export association which they formed in 1961 and which is called the Concentrated Phosphate Export Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.050" offset="611558">This association was organized in order to enable these members to act jointly in the overseas sales of phosphate which is used in the production of plant food or fertilizer.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.178" offset="664116">The association is properly registered with the Federal Trade Commission under the Webb-Pomerene Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.055" offset="691597">Now, the Board of Directors of this association determines the prices at which the corporate members of the association will sell their phosphate to the association and it determines the prices at which the association will sell the phosphate to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.063" offset="771636">In addition, the Board of Directors of the association also allocates the available business among the members of the association.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.502" offset="813432">Transactions here on issue involved some 43 million dollars in sales to the Republic of Korea by the export association.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.827" offset="854706">These sales were all made pursuant to our United States Foreign Aid Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.947" offset="875186">Indeed, under this program, the United States through AID, the Agency for International Development has been making grants to Korea since 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.835" offset="922728">Two basic methods of procurement are involved in this case in two of the transactions which are before the court involving some 8 million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.907" offset="974973">The procurement was handled by the United States General Services Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.504" offset="1001409">In that situation, GSA issued a standard invitation to bid, accepted the low bid on behalf of the United States, paid the Association, took delivery of the phosphate and arrange for it shipment to Korea.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.456" offset="1065148">In nine other transactions before the Court involving some 35 million dollars, eight authorize the Office of Supply of the Republic of Korea to handle the procurement of the phosphate.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.221" offset="1120214">Each face of this transaction however was rigidly controlled by AID.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.553" offset="1141635">In these transactions, the Phosphate Association was paid by United States Bank which in turn received its funds from the United States Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.778" offset="1190536">Whichever method of procurement was followed, either through GSA or through the Office of Supply of the Republic of Korea, AID supervised every aspect of the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.852" offset="1242781">Until final delivery, the aid -- AID retained the right to divert the shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.282" offset="1276531">As indicated above, my comments in both cases, the funds for the phosphate came from the United States Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.835" offset="1314670">The court below said, AID initiated controlled, directed, and financed the transactions involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="310.821" offset="1346644">Mr. Christopher, I may have missed you when you're talking about the two transactions in which GSA did the procurement directly.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="340.156" offset="1463986">Forgive me for interrupting here but I -- to me the importance, I'm troubles by the mootness point in this case and that has an important -- may have an important bearing.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_christopher" startTime="351.318" stopTime="386.355">
            <label>Mr. Warren Christopher</label>
            <text syncTime="351.318" offset="1508603">My understanding of the transaction Mr. Justice Fortas is that the goods, the phosphate in each case were shipped from Florida to Korea but in the GSA transaction, GSA actually took legal control of the goods before they were shipped out from the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.903" offset="1590941">On the other hand, the Government makes no distinction between the two types of transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.421" offset="1613093">We think we do not argue that there is a legal difference between the two types of transactions.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="386.355" offset="1648828">Well, if you -- I see you place no emphasis upon the possibility that the G -- if GSA did take delivery on those two transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.306" offset="1708596">There may be a difference in terms of the issues on this case which you -- there is such a difference you'd like to waiver is that it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Warren Christopher</label>
            <text syncTime="409.476" offset="1741302">Well, Mr. Justice Fortas, we think the crucial fact here is that the funds came from the United States Treasury and that the transaction was controlled in every respect by AID.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.715" offset="1794278">We do not think that the legal steps in the procurement differed significantly to make the legal difference between the GSA procurement and the Republic of Korea Procurement.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="437.445" offset="1853106">Do you contend in the two cases that GSA took delivery in other words that so far as I am concerned the contract was completely performed within the United States?</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_christopher" startTime="450.342" stopTime="452.812">
            <label>Mr. Warren Christopher</label>
            <text syncTime="450.342" offset="1904724">Yes, sir and I believe the stipulation bears that out Mr. Justice.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="452.812" offset="1914650">But, with respect to the other transactions, delivery was not effective until the phosphate arrived in the Republic of Korea, is that right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_christopher" startTime="466.440" stopTime="483.777">
            <label>Mr. Warren Christopher</label>
            <text syncTime="466.440" offset="1969089">With respect to the other transactions, the Republic of Korea sought the bids in Korea, bids were made there and the phosphate was transferred I believe from the Export Association to the Korean Government in Korea.</text>

          <turn speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="483.777" stopTime="488.236">

            <text syncTime="483.777" offset="2038471">But you -- you nevertheless make no point about that difference?</text>

            <label>Mr. Warren Christopher</label>
            <text syncTime="488.236" offset="2056338">No, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.615" offset="2057801">I think that in all the transactions before the court, all 11 of the transactions, the United States should prevail because the funds came from United States Treasury.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="499.721" stopTime="509.211">
            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="499.721" offset="2102209">But if you don't prevail in the ROK transactions and you don't care about prevailing in the other two.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_christopher" startTime="509.211" stopTime="637.616">
            <label>Mr. Warren Christopher</label>
            <text syncTime="509.211" offset="2140244">Well, Mr. Justice, I think the differences between the two types of procurement are not significant to make it turn on those factors sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.551" offset="2185592">Now, under the stipulation, Korea is under no obligation to repay the funds expanded to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.826" offset="2222686">However, so that the matter is fairly before the Court, I should say that when Korea sells the phosphate to private purchasers in Korea, the funds generated which are not necessarily equal to the value of United States must be set aside as counterpart funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.742" offset="2294366">These funds have been used in practice mostly to support the Korean defense establishment but as I say, the stipulation makes clear that Korea is under no obligation to repay the funds expended in these procurements.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.449" offset="2373151">In 1964, the United States filed a complaint in the Southern District of New York charging that the activities of this association constituted illegal price fixing and an allocation of business in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.377" offset="2440861">The court below dismissed the complaint holding that the transactions were within the Web-Pomerene exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.770" offset="2470431">In the view of the court below, because the goods were shipped to a foreign country, the District Court thought they constituted export trade within the meaning of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.220" offset="2516302">However, the District Court noted in its opinion that it seems obviously unfair to the United States to permit the defendants to charge and artificially set price and to deprive the United States of the benefits which might come from price competition between the association notwithstanding that statement, the District Court felt that the exports here were within the exception -- exemption of the Webb-Pomerene Act and therefore held that the Government's complaint must be dismissed.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="637.616" offset="2653811">Is there any contention here that there was not competition between the association and other bidders?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_christopher" startTime="647.488" stopTime="657.403">
            <label>Mr. Warren Christopher</label>
            <text syncTime="647.488" offset="2693308">Mr. Justice White, there was competition between the association and other foreign bidders and other bidders from the United States.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="657.403" stopTime="661.088">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="657.403" offset="2733014">And there were foreign bidders in this picture all the time, weren't there?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_christopher" startTime="661.088" stopTime="692.206">
            <label>Mr. Warren Christopher</label>
            <text syncTime="661.088" offset="2747747">That's correct Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.432" offset="2757151">The extent of them can be indicated from the fact that they made less than 16% of the bids and got less than 18% of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.084" offset="2795708">But under our theory of the case, the presence of foreign competition even to that limited degree does not change what we regard as the proper result and that is that where United States pays the bill and where AID supervises the transaction, the Webb-Pomerene exemption should not apply.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="692.206" offset="2872195">And this doesn't make any difference that the fact that one of the purposes of the Act was to permit Americans to compete successfully with foreign bidders?</text>
            <text syncTime="702.931" offset="2915140">Is that -- that purpose is present here but nevertheless you think should be limited where the United States pays the bill?</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_christopher" startTime="708.265" stopTime="709.116">
            <label>Mr. Warren Christopher</label>
            <text syncTime="708.265" offset="2936456">That's correct.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="709.116" stopTime="722.244">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="709.116" offset="2939800">Even though -- even though if the purpose of the action is satisfied, you would think the purpose was affected in having a bit lower than foreign bids?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_christopher" startTime="722.244" stopTime="1013.988">
            <label>Mr. Warren Christopher</label>
            <text syncTime="722.244" offset="2992358">Well, the basic purpose of the Act was to enable the American exporters to compete in foreign markets for what I would call traditional foreign business where the foreign source pays the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.044" offset="3043558">Now the framers of the Act were very careful to make sure that there'll be no injury to the American consumer, to the American taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.579" offset="3077726">Now, I think it's that legislative purpose which illuminates the Act and which makes it clear here that where Uncle Sam pays the bill and aids and supervises the transaction that the exception does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.873" offset="3134882">Our -- it seems to me that as we look at the Webb-Pomerene Act, we must look at the underlying reasons, we're not prisoner of the dictionary by any means, I think our obligation is to look at the history and purpose of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.720" offset="3206248">As just indicated in my comments to Mr. Justice White, Congress was trying in this Act to give the American exporters a better chance to compete against foreign monopolies especially foreign buying cartels.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.532" offset="3277511">The philosophy of the Act was United States business is it should be freed of antitrust restraints and their approach to foreign market.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.352" offset="3308753">Congress thought it was acting primarily to aid small companies which had thought could not compete effectively in foreign markets unless they could act jointly.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.627" offset="3349922">Now, the purpose of the Act in my view was frankly a very chauvinistic one.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.093" offset="3367790">Both of them in for whom the Act is named emphasized this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.698" offset="3386180">In the House, Congressman Web indicated his willingness to allow a combination between anyone or anything for the purpose of capturing export trade but only so long as it did not punish the people of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.448" offset="3445112">In the Senate, Senator Pomerene pointedly remarked were not concerned about giving to the foreign consumer a minimum price.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.896" offset="3478967">Indeed, the FTC report from which the Act is from emphasized that the form of organization permitted must not operate to the prejudice of the American public reflecting that chauvinism this Act authorize joint activity in circumstance where the resulting non-competitive price would be borne by a foreign country or by the people of the foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.842" offset="3582725">But the Act in its legislative history make it clear as we read it that this joint activity was to be permitted only so long as there had been no adverse effect upon the American economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.589" offset="3633716">Only so long as the American people would not be punished, the whole purpose of the Act points out we think an exclusion of those transactions whereas here the anticompetitive conduct, the joint activity might be involved would be at the expense of the American taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.149" offset="3723995">Congress was trying to strengthen the hand of the American exporter to be sure as Mr. Justice White said</text>
            <text syncTime="911.751" offset="3750327">But the export trade within the contemplation of the Act in our view was the traditional export trade between America and foreign countries, American businesses trying to get business and foreign countries that will be paid for by foreign sources or by foreign governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.554" offset="3833605">Now, there are powerful reasons we think in addition to the legislative history supporting the construction that we advance here.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.650" offset="3873938">The Webb-Pomerene Act is an exception to the broad mandate of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.446" offset="3901106">It's a familiar principle that such exceptions are to be narrowly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.745" offset="3926392">We think that this rule requires the Webb-Pomerene Act be confined to its underlying purpose and not given the expansive construction argued for here by the appellees which would involve as we see it a potential burden on the American taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.437" offset="4005073">We think also that the history of Government procurement points the same direction in all Government procurement; it's been a strong policy of Congress that there should be no interference with normal competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.794" offset="4066513">We think that when the taxpayers are paying the bill as they are inevitably in procurement situations, the benefits of competition should be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.760" offset="4110399">Now, Mr. Justice White one of the limitations of history is that it doesn't tell us what the circumstances would be under a different set of assumptions, rather a different set of premises.</text>

            <text syncTime="1104.066" offset="4519685">They do not control United States antitrust policy and frequently they take actions which in the long run turn out to be in violation of antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.928" offset="4567124">Indeed, the only other time that this Court I think has written an opinion on the Webb-Pomerene area and the Alkali Export Association case in 325 U.S., this Court made it clear that it was the responsibility of the Department of Justice to invoke the Sherman Act against the Webb-Pomerene Associations when the associate -- when the circumstances were appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.900" offset="4658970">Perfectly clear, I think under all the precedence that the officials at AID have no power to waive or suspend the provisions of the Sherman Act no matter what they might have done to encourage the formation of Webb-Pomerene Associations or their bidding on these contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.595" offset="4737755">Neither does it seem to me to be persuasive here that in the course of the legislative history, there are indications that Congress was aware that there might be loans to foreign governments during the World War 1 period when this Act was enacted or thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.910" offset="4814973">The crucial difference is that the loans refer to in that portion of the legislative history were repayable and the burden of noncompetitive conduct, the burden of joint activity would fall on the foreign governments or their citizens where it isn't the case of United States grants which has been the familiar pattern under AID.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.855" offset="4902745">The burden of noncompetitive conduct falls on the American taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.971" offset="4923225">It's our position here that the framers of the Act, although they wanted to encourage export trade and wanted to encourage small business in the United States to get together to compete in foreign markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.936" offset="4971081">They were equally clear that this was not to be in any respect at the expense of the American taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.285" offset="5000547">Now, would you take five companies as large as these companies are, I think one might not unnaturally think that if they were competing against each other and this or comparable situations that a lower price might be achieved as I say history in this transaction does not tell us that but the whole premise of our antitrust laws is that competition will produce lower prices and it is those lower prices of that competition which I believe the framers of the Act would have wanted to preserve for the American taxpayer and those instances where there is federal government procurement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1280.736" offset="5226350">There might be two possible grounds on which mootness could be suggested neither of them persuasive I believe sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.673" offset="5258115">First, the Webb-Pomerene Association here has been dissolved but it is a familiar rule of this Court that the right to antitrust relief cannot be undercut by the dissolution of an association or corporation during the course of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.499" offset="5337318">That goes back to, I think the Freight Association case in 166 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.386" offset="5360933">The second ground on which on which mootness might be suggested is that on January 1, 1967 the AID officials adopted a regulation forbidding Webb-Pomerene bidding or bidding by Webb-Pomerene Associations and know his instances where there is procurement from United States sources only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.239" offset="5468348">Now that's a limited high type of regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.632" offset="5481932">It would not in terms affect this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.802" offset="5494575">Even if it did though Mr. Justice Fortas, it seems to us that the fact that AID could change that regulation, modify and go back to its own rules, makes it clear that this case is not moot and underscores the need for a determination here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.001" offset="5571375">We're seeking a statutory determination of what we regard as a very important underlying question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.986" offset="5599274">It's a reconciliation of two important statutes, the Webb-Pomerene Act and the Sherman Act, the determination of that statutory question and the importance of it has not been diminished by anything that's transpired and for the reasons I've given, I believe the case is not technically moot.</text>

            <text syncTime="1400.846" offset="5706794">Mr. Chief Justice if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.224" offset="5728319">I think we would differ a bit with to the Deputy Attorney General in stating the question presented on this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.097" offset="5767711">We would state the question as being whether AID finance export sales made in competition with foreign producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.104" offset="5811806">This export trade, as those words are used in the Webb Act, it seems to us of considerable importance on the stipulated facts of this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.411" offset="5864991">Importance both in terms of the general significance of the case to the propositions the government is putting forward and the importance in terms of the outcome of the case that there was active foreign competition here in each of the transactions challenged by the Government with one exception, that one exception being a transaction on which the defendants received no award of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.681" offset="5994141">In the Webb-Pomerene Act in defining export trade, Congress went to particular care to outline first what export trade was to be covered by the immunity of the Webb-Act defining it in terms of the export of goods from this country to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.744" offset="6078360">It also defined export trade in terms of what it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.016" offset="6095391">It is not production.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.187" offset="6100093">It is not manufactured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.359" offset="6108766">And it is not sale within the United States for resale or consumption here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.598" offset="6133739">In addition, Congress attached a series of provisos in which it was stated that even no one act might be within export trade as literally defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.791" offset="6178565">It would nevertheless be subject to the Sherman Act prohibitions if it resulted in any effect, artificial or intentional effect on prices on the United States, any restraint of the export trade of domestic competitors on the association or any restraint of trade in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.799" offset="6270516">This is a stipulated record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.917" offset="6283055">It is stipulated here that the goods sold by the defendants were exported from this country, not only to Korea but to 38 other countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.764" offset="6334464">It is stipulated that the defendants met all of the requirements of the Webb-Pomerene Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.278" offset="6364453">Now, it is conceded that they did not violate any of its provisos.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.038" offset="6379499">Consequently that being so, it seems to us that the ultimate question presented to this Court by this appeal is whether the transaction is challenged by the Government were so radically different from anything that Congress might have had in mind in 1918.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.314" offset="6464658">As to justify or require a departure from the otherwise pretty plain English of that law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1746.727" offset="7090239">There's just no question that the Webb-Pomerene Act was designed basically to encourage American companies to participate more extensively in export trade by allowing them to collaborate not only for the purposes suggested by the Government but also for the purposes of reducing cost and mastering greater resources.</text>

            <text syncTime="1817.617" offset="7373824">I wouldn't agree that that fact standing alone is determinative but it seems to me certainly one of the most significant facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.529" offset="7409455">In our case, as I understand it, the government's position comes down solely that a proposition that there was injury to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.186" offset="7456162">An injury which they presumed as I understand there case from applying to the sales of this Webb-Pomerene Association, Sherman Act principles to which Congress has said are not to apply so long as that association is engaged in export trade and that seems to us a peculiar avenue along which to approach the question of whether this was export trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.573" offset="7577684">But even if you start down that avenue at a reason why we emphasize foreign competition here, even if you start down that avenue, it is our further position that you find no injury, no injury in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.977" offset="7647274">Now, Mr. Christopher has emphasize that in his argument and the Government has in its brief the point that the Republic of Korea bought concentrated phosphates in this particular transactions using grant funds and that therefore there was a burden on the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.623" offset="7733896">I suggest the burden is far greater where a foreign competitor wins an award of that business because that's foreign competitor was just as eligible as where this defendants to be paid an AID dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.035" offset="7799515">And every AID dollar paid to a supplier from Tunisia on account of his sale to the Republic of Korea was a dollar that was gone from the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.282" offset="7848521">Whereas every dollar that these defendants obtained in this Korean Market as was true with the dollars it obtained in selling in 30 (a) other markets was a dollar kept in the United States and to that extent on the facts of this case it seemed to me if there is a physical burden of any kind we help to reduce it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2175.242" offset="8804289">No question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.204" offset="8824142">Now before getting back into the facts which at least as we view of them showed that these who are not totally different transactions from the kind -- Congress contemplated, I would also like to note in passing that the Congress which enacted the Webb-Pomerene Act in 1917 and 1918 was itself very busy in foreign aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.275" offset="8936469">It was during that period that Congress was authorizing and appropriating very considerable sums of money for foreign assistance programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.636" offset="8981922">So that certainly Congress had within its general contemplation in adopting the Webb Act that export trade associations would trade in foreign markets that were supported in United States that recognition was expressed during the debates prior to passage of the Act and at the end of World War 1 and immediately thereafter, Export Trade Associations did sell at that time to European customers who were totally dependent on the financial assistance of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.128" offset="9139911">Export Trade Associations have continued to make those sales from time to time during the 50 years since the Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.945" offset="9171153">During war time and post-war period in the Land Lease Program as it stipulated in various of the modern foreign aid programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.627" offset="9213889">During that same period, the Congress has regularly reviewed the foreign assistance programs and has frequently reviewed the Webb Act and has never at anytime suggested that it intended in anyway in adopting the modern foreign assistance programs to roll back the Webb Act as the Government now acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.775" offset="9310438">Now, Mr. Christopher referred to a sentence in Judge Ryan's opinion below which does seem to me a good way to get into a more detailed discussion as some of the facts here in which Judge Ryan and I am referring to page 362, the joint appendix says it seems obviously unfair to the United States in describing the situation in which Webb Associations sell the foreign aid finance customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.630" offset="9445857">It's quite clear to us that Judge Ryan in that sentence was describing the Government's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.809" offset="9470621">He says, herein is the core of the Government's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.574" offset="9481697">We cannot say that it does not have appeal and then follows the sentence that Mr. Christopher referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.987" offset="9511372">But Judge Ryan then goes on in the balance of his opinion to set forth his conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.934" offset="9539062">As to why the Government's position why the superficial appeal of unfairness in the Government's position is simply not so as a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.749" offset="9586395">Now, in this particular case, we rely quite heavily on the aspect of foreign competition as meeting any suggestion of fairness -- unfairness as well as two other aspects of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.796" offset="9666539">First, the full disclosure to and yet encouragement by officials of both the Korean and United States Government of the defendant's participation in a finance business; and secondly, the facts, the stipulated facts which is we view and I'm quite clearly demonstrate that there was no injury here to United States as a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.756" offset="9778448">Now, these defendants and their association registered with the Federal Trade Commission, there's no question about that, observed all of formal requirements of the Webb Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.859" offset="9822856">They did what Congress intended where the Associations to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.278" offset="9840515">The Association went out and sold American produced phosphates wherever it could find or create demand all over the world in 38 countries in addition to Korea, although Korea was the single most important consumer or purchaser of these association's products.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.562" offset="9925569">At all times, it is stipulated AID, GSA, and the Office of Supply of the Republic of Korea, knew what the defendants were, knew how they did do business and at all times, all of our bids to Korea were made in response to formal invitations in competitive public bidding procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.016" offset="10019401">Now, we don't suggest that those facts themselves give rise to any kind of an antitrust immunity and we don't suggest that AID's regulations and activities take the place of either the Webb Act on the one hand or the Sherman Act on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.970" offset="10099231">But they are facts which do seem to us to be quite significant as they relate to the threat running through the Government's case suggesting unfairness on our part and perhaps even more importantly, we believe that they are significant to the question of injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.608" offset="10173837">Had AID officials believed that their program was being in any way burdened by the activities of these defendants, in any way injured or frustrated as the Government has suggested by these defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.809" offset="10234650">I think it's unreasonable to conclude that they would nevertheless have solicited bids from us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.875" offset="10258892">When AID clearly did possess the authority which it exercised on January 1, 1967 they shot Webb Act Associations out of AID finance markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.210" offset="10312182">Now, a second important fact is this factor foreign competition which is already been covered quite thoroughly and that brings me to what I think is the quite clear fact that there is just no evidence in this stipulated record that there was any injury of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.359" offset="10408835">That there was any burden of any kind on the United States any harm either that Korea or to the United States foreign aid program and this is a stipulated record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.610" offset="10457840">During the hearing below before Judge Ryan which took the place of a full trial, he probed quite carefully into this question and in response to his questions, the Government's counsel conceded there was no suggestion here by the Government that the defendant or their association had in any way overcharged either AID or Korea, or had engaged in any way in any unfair, unreasonable or discriminatory price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.887" offset="10590960">There is never been any suggestion in this case of any damage, any injury, any burden, any unfairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.283" offset="10620531">As a matter of fact, the only injury that is set to flow here flows from applying to business activities which are exempt from the Sherman Act, principles that would apply only if the exemption were lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.946" offset="10711124">Now, not only is there no injury but if the Court please, we think the record is quite clear that the evidence relating to that question is quite to the contrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="2664.327" offset="10760652">Well, how about maybe -- the problem I think is a problem of statutory construction application here and the United States -- sales to the United States are not expressly outside of the coverage of the antitrust exemption under Webb-Pomerene Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.929" offset="10863052">But do I understand that you agree that there are outside of that exemption on the basis of the doctrine that sovereign is excluded unless specifically -- unless otherwise specifically provided?</text>

            <text syncTime="2750.388" offset="11104946">If it is considered a sale to the United States, it may be some other questions to be answered but at least to that extent, you take it out of the Webb-Pomerene exemption and you may, then I think you would say, you want to find out what the United States does sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="2918.446" offset="11777128">I believe that I responded to your similar question before the recess Justice Fortas by saying that in my view, on the facts you post that is a Government purchase and Government consumption abroad.</text>

            <text syncTime="2937.581" offset="11853720">That the provisos would come into play and depending on the facts and the situation, it would be found that there was a kind of effect on domestic commerce which the Act, the Webb Act proscribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.759" offset="11906382">But in this case, it has been stipulated that the United States was not the purchaser on page 49 of the appendix in our stipulation it states AID did not itself procure any concentrated phosphates for Korean and the record is replete with the fact --</text>

            <label>Mr. Samuel W. Murphy, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2972.318" offset="11992691">Well, the Government as I understand it attributes no significance to the difference and in our view GSA's participation did not order the substance of the transactions at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.588" offset="12053713">Now, Mr. Christopher has suggested that this is a very significant case in which the Government needs a broad ruling which brings one naturally to the question Justice Fortas also raised this warning about mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.527" offset="12117452">In the first instance, we would emphasize that narrowness of this case stipulated record the fact that it relates to AID finance only to AID finance markets in which there is foreign competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.187" offset="12176071">The emphasis placed in the case by the Government on the fact that Korea used grand rather than loan aid whereas at the present time, grants form a relatively small part of total foreign aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.723" offset="12234271">Now, finally, the whatever significance this narrow case had was pretty well sucked out of it when effective January 1, 1967 AID adopted a regulation which went directly to the question of the extent to which Webb Associations can deal and aid finance markets by providing that such associations would not be eligible to bid unless foreign suppliers were also eligible to bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.875" offset="12362898">The practical consequence of that regulation was to put this association out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.890" offset="12394977">The association seized all operations in June of 1967, has made no sales since then, and the association was formally dissolved and entirely abandoned at the end of last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.197" offset="12456208">The Government's case it seems to us comes down to a policy argument that is somehow a bad thing to allow export associations to sell to foreign customers being finance to the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.865" offset="12518797">We suggest that that is an argument better addressed to the Congress and to this Court and that in any event, the narrow nature and now the dead nature of this case will not support the weight of that kind of policy consideration so that the judgment below should be affirmed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Warren Christopher</label>
            <text syncTime="3131.164" offset="12627989">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.564" offset="12641677">I wish to make only three brief points in concluding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.670" offset="12666023">First, the Government believes that the presence or absence of foreign competition is not the determinative factor on this issue of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.038" offset="12719522">The foreign competition was present here was only that competition which was permitted by AID.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.799" offset="12750555">As paragraph 23 of the record indicates, page 49 of the stipulation, the only foreign purchasers that were able to participate in the bidding, I'm sorry, the only foreign companies that were able to participate in bidding were those in countries which were authorize to bid under the aid regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.552" offset="12853582">Basically, aid permitted companies in the underdeveloped countries and the less developed countries to bid on this procurement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.536" offset="12893497">I think this demonstrates very well how irrelevant the presence or absence of foreign competition is to determination of the statutory issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.347" offset="12928711">AID could tomorrow ban all foreign competition and is frequently done so in connection with its procurement or its supporting of foreign countries procurement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.502" offset="12977403">In a situation where American companies had a monopoly there would be a foreign competition at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.693" offset="13002167">And yet, the statutory question would remain the same so I think we would say that the procurement agency determines the extent of the foreign competition, the procurement agency is able to determine whether or not it wishes on a given procurement to permit foreign companies to participate in the bidding and thus, to have some of our dollars go abroad to reflect on Mr. Murphy's concern and that fact the extent to which the procurement agency permits foreign competition is I say should not and cannot be controlling on the matters of statutory construction involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.874" offset="13166843">Second, while we do not contend that there was any fraud on behalf of the -- around part of the defendant appellees, at the same time we would not agree that there's been no conceivable injury that the Government in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.025" offset="13235493">The record shows that each of the defendant corporations which form this association is a company of more than a hundred million dollars in assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.554" offset="13273631">One of them has four and a half billion dollars in assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.062" offset="13291604">To suggest that if they were bidding against each other, the result would not have been different is I think to fail to look at the realities which lie behind the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.732" offset="13338311">Four of the five companies that make up this export association are in the top five in this industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.817" offset="13362657">All five are in the top 10 and I think when you look at those facts, you have to recognize that if the bidding had been fully competitive of the American taxpayer it had the advantage of having American companies bidding against each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.224" offset="13432247">It might have had a different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.040" offset="13443532">So while as I say, we do not charge any fraud on the part of the defendant companies, we think this is the very pure question of statutory interpretation and an important one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.426" offset="13489089">Nevertheless, the premise of the antitrust law is I think is effective here to indicate that there should be bidding for the full competition where Government procurement dollars are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.024" offset="13551470">And finally, I would like to go back to Mr. Justice Fortas' questions and the points he has been making because I believe that shows, I believe they illuminate the fact that the form of this transaction should not be controlling here but rather, what should be controlling is that this is Government procurement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.613" offset="13637778">These are United States tax dollars and they ought to be spent under circumstances where the American taxpayers has the full benefits of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.748" offset="13678320">This has been the tradition in Government procurement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.015" offset="13691382">This should be followed in the Webb-Pomerene Act as well.</text>

            <label>Mr. Warren Christopher</label>
            <text syncTime="3409.209" offset="13740178">The Webb-Pomerene Act, Mr. Justice Fortas, provides the exemption for activities done in the course of export trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.670" offset="13782079">It's the Government's contention that when Congress used those terms, it was referring to traditional export trade where American businesses sold in foreign countries to foreign purchasers who paid from foreign funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.337" offset="13848743">We think that legislative history makes it clear that Congress did not use those words in referring to or to refer to American procurement.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="3446.987" stopTime="3460.057">
            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="3446.987" offset="13891271">In other words, it's not, you're not relying on any expressed provision on the statute but by implication derived from the fact that the United States has a sovereign in that doctrine and the legislative history?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_christopher" startTime="3460.057" stopTime="3498.508">
            <label>Mr. Warren Christopher</label>
            <text syncTime="3460.057" offset="13943620">Yes, Mr. Justice I believe that could be argued that the proviso taking out of the exclusion, things are -- that are in restraint of trade within the United States, I think it could be argued that that proviso might be effective here because this conduct restrains trade in American procurement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.274" offset="14028466">But the Government believes that the sound or articulation of the argument is that the history of the Act and the intention of Congress excluded Government procurement from the concept of export trade that they were trying to permit companies to get together on.</text>
