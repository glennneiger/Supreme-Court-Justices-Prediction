            <label>Mr. Victor Rabinowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="20.604" offset="185762">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.416" offset="197047">This case is before the Court on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals from the Third Circuit and is limited to a single legal issue which we think is of profound importance to several million young Americans now in the Armed Forces of the United States in relating to the balance between civil and military jurisdiction over them.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.761" offset="282415">Question is a simple one.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.877" offset="290879">Does a Court-martial have jurisdiction in peace time to try a member of the Armed Forces charged with a civilian crime and by that, I mean, a crime which is normally cognizable in the civil courts alleged to have been committed by him off post and off duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.542" offset="373530">In this case, the crime is attempted rape but if the Government is right, it could try a member of the Armed Forces for any crime at all including securities violation, violation of the anti-trust laws or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.108" offset="435806">Unless the Court think that this is a far-fetched example, I learned this morning that a technical sergeant at Myrtle Airbase in South Carolina was convicted just a few days ago of the crime of income tax evasion by a Court-Martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.889" offset="518980">The relative role of the military in civilian government has been of considerable concern throughout our history and for that matter throughout the history of England.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.432" offset="565060">Under one hand, the Constitution provides that Congress may make rules for the Government in regulation of the land and naval forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.213" offset="596198">On the other hand, it provides for jury trial in an Article 3 Court for grand jury indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.217" offset="624201">In federal cases and most states also have similar provisions, some variation on the grand jury but all of them provide for a trial before a civilian court and for a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.295" offset="684596">In this kind of situation, this Court has always taken the position that in order to determine the relationship of these two apparently conflicting provisions or provisions that may conflict in our Constitution, that's it's appropriate to look into the historical context, to look at the probable intent of the framers of the Constitution and to determine on the basis of that what rule shall apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.198" offset="808208">Now, we differ somewhat with the Government on our view of the history which is not particularly surprising but as we see the history, for over a hundred years of both before and after the adoption of the Constitution, Court-martial jurisdiction was limited both in this country and in England to offenses such as decision, mutiny, striking or scorning a superior officer, tardiness for parade, failure to salute, theft from military stores and a host of other offenses daring and obvious immediate relationship to the army, many of which are not punishable in the civilian courts at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.544" offset="1001514">These are the kind of offenses and the only kind of offenses listed in the Articles of War adopted by the Continental Congress in 1775, renewed in 1776 and in essence, they are the offenses for which Court-martial jurisdiction was provided in the United States in peace time up until 1916.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.554" offset="1101615">It was in the articles of 1916, perhaps an anticipation of another war, but in any event, in 1916, for the first time, Congress provided Court-martial jurisdiction and the Articles of War for the first time defined crimes other than military crimes going to offenses such as rape, murder, assault and similar ordinary, conventional civilian offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.443" offset="1229093">Now, the framers of the Constitution obviously did not act in a vacuum as this Court has pointed out on numerous occasions both in handling jury cases such as Patton and particularly in handling military law cases such as Covert against Reid and the many cases that followed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.941" offset="1319163">The people who framed the constitution were quite aware of the English Revolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.109" offset="1343822">They were aware of the abuses that they themselves suffered in this very field and it may reasonably be assumed that they wrote the Constitution with this in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.046" offset="1391574">English history is I think fairly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.863" offset="1414875">In 1627, the petitioner of right addressed to Charles I, complained of the institution of Court-martial for any offense even an offense trying a soldier if that happened in the Courts of England where the civil courts were open and the petition was addressed to the king because the king had directed commissions to go forth and to try members of the Armed Forces although the civilian courts according to the petitioner were perfectly capable of trying these forces, these offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.355" offset="1560743">As a result to the petition of right, King Charles withdrew his military commissions but the subject was a matter of considerable conflict between parliament and the stewards for a good while after.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.996" offset="1607346">In 1689, after the revolution of 1688, parliament passed the Mutiny Act which for the first time provided by act of parliament at least, trial by Court-Martial, of people in the Armed Forces and the only three offenses that were listed in the Mutiny Act were desertion, sedition and mutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.148" offset="1716015">Now, the Act was a very limited duration.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.467" offset="1733256">The first act was passed for a single period, for over a period of one single year and Congress and the parliament did over the next century renewed the statute annually.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.091" offset="1783724">Each time confining Court-martial jurisdiction for crimes committed within England to crimes that were clearly military in nature of the type mentioned in the Mutiny Act of 1689, the desertion, sedition and disrespect to the superior officer, that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.322" offset="1888632">Now, it is true that as the English empire expanded and England took up commitments in foreign countries that Court-martial jurisdiction was exercised over crimes committed by members of the Armed Forces on civilians in foreign countries but only in foreign countries, never in England.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.929" offset="1987062">There is some discussion in the authorities indicating and there's a case in England in about the middle of the 18th century holding that whereas Court-martial jurisdiction within England came under the Mutiny Act and therefore within the area of Congresses, of the parliament's jurisdiction, Court-martial jurisdiction oversees was within the king's prerogative and I think that by analogy, we might very well say that whereas Court-martial jurisdiction in the United States in time of peace is quite a different thing from Court-martial jurisdiction in times of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.248" offset="2156335">And in time of war, Court-martial -- an extended Court-martial jurisdiction may perhaps be argued forth as coming within the war power of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.597" offset="2197713">This particular offense and the issue presented before us was committed in time of peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.645" offset="2217984">It was in 1956, it was in the territory of Hawaii, the civil courts were open, there was no war, it was one of the periods in our recent history in which there didn't to be a war and the issue is not an issue of the war power of Congress but rather an issue of the Congress' power to take away from persons in the Armed Forces the right of trial by jury and the other protections of the Constitution.</text>

            <label>Mr. Victor Rabinowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="569.375" offset="2380884">I really see no escape.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.940" offset="2387153">I think that the statute is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.633" offset="2397915">The statute asserts jurisdiction over everybody in the Armed Forces and I really have difficulty in avoiding the constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.670" offset="2446085">I think and I'll come to that in a moment Your Honor that there may be several different views of the constitutional issue as Your Honor suggested in the concurring opinion in Covert but that there is a constitutional issue here, it seems to me is unavoidable.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.274" offset="2512436">Now, when the columnist drew the Constitution, it is perfectly obvious that this was a matter of considerable importance to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.687" offset="2542111">And as a matter of fact, the declaration of independence contains a reference to the fact in one of the complaints listed against the king was that he had asserted military jurisdiction over crimes committed by the Armed Forces, by the English soldiers on civilians in the United States or what was then the colony.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.218" offset="2636257">And this was protested against and I might say that throughout history, there have been two parallel lines here.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.145" offset="2667917">Under one hand, there has been the complaint of the civilian that the army will take jurisdiction and provide what the Constitution -- what the declaration of independence called a mock trial, thus permitting the military to abuse the civilians by trying them in accordance with presumably more lenient rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.047" offset="2755584">On the other hand, there has been similar complain, I should say opposite complaint but arising out of the same context that the army will provide for the soldier a more strict and a more difficult form of punishment than he would get in the civilian courts because he does not have in the army right of trial by jury, right to a civilian court and the right to a grand jury indictment and I think the fact is that both of these things may happen and it is to avoid both of these things that we think civilian jurisdiction are to be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.829" offset="2918693">Now, the articles of war adopted in 1776 remained unchanged so far as this particular subject is concerned until the Enrolment Act of 1863 in the midst of the civil war when for the first time Congress passed a statute giving some degree of military jurisdiction over crimes committed, over civilian crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.135" offset="3047946">That was specifically confined to time of war and this Court held in the Coleman case and in a series of cases that followed it that Congress intended by that statute to give jurisdiction of the military only in cases where the civilian courts were not operating.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.387" offset="3132897">The leading case of course is Coleman against Tennessee where the issue arose as to who had jurisdiction over a crime committed by a member of the union forces in the then occupied territory of Tennessee, there were then no civilian courts operating, certainly no civilian courts of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.978" offset="3207293">There may have been civilian courts of the confederacy operating.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.824" offset="3222653">The Court said it would be absurd to say that a soldier in the union army could be tried by a civilian federal court, by a confederate civilian court and held that the army had military jurisdiction over that crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.687" offset="3282108">But this Court has repeatedly since that time interpreted the 1863 Act applying only where armies were actually in the field and where civilian courts were not open.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.700" offset="3334144">As I say, it was not until 1916 that the articles of war were amended to cover the -- substantially the situation that we have now.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.664" offset="3382000">Now, although this case is one of first impression and the Court has never decided this precise issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.528" offset="3413452">As a matter of fact, there are only three or four decisions even in the Courts of Appeals on this issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="841.555" offset="3469563">I don't recall which and they both came to the same conclusion without very much of a discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.715" offset="3486281">I think they just assumed that without any constitutional discussion at all in any of the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.202" offset="3508224">They merely went to the articles of war, noted that the articles of war did give jurisdiction over this sort of offense and proceeded from that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.877" offset="3542915">I don't know of a single case and I've check the records where they're available where any of these was raised by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.981" offset="3571336">Now, in the tough case, in Covert against Reid and Kinsella against Singleton and McElroy case and Lee against Madigan and a whole series of cases that were decided, most of them after the second world war.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.958" offset="3631208">The Court touched upon a similar issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.599" offset="3645733">Discussed not testified -- discussed at very great length on some of the issue namely the jurisdiction of the Court-martial over people who were not members of the Armed Forces and the history is quite familiar to this Court and I won't go into those cases now except to note that there was one theme which it seems to me ran through all of those cases and that was the very deep concern shown by all of the members of the Court to prevent too broad an extension of military jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.140" offset="3783973">And the Court felt that unlike the Commerce Clause or other provisions of the Constitution, which have been given a very broad interpretation that here so far as this clause was concerned, the Constitution would be given a very narrow interpretation and that view, as I say, was expressed in the -- in Covert against Reid where the Court said every extension of military jurisdiction is an encroachment on the jurisdiction of the civil courts and more important, acts as a deprivation of the right to jury trial and other treasured constitutional protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.297" offset="3944573">In Lee against Madigan, also, the Court indicated its reluctance to give military tribunals authority to try people for non-military offenses and so we are face to face with this problem now and it seems to us that on the basis of the history that we have before us there is no justification for extending jurisdiction of the Court-martial over persons who try ordinary, conventional, civilian crimes where the courts are open, perfectly capable of handling the case where there are no extraordinary circumstance such as war or some similar event to make it impossible for these people to be handed over to the civilian courts for trial and as a matter of fact, the government in its brief says that some 80% of these cases are tried in the civilian courts but apparently there are 20% that are not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1543.831" offset="6278666">Court-martials have always tried civilian crimes, always from the very beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.410" offset="6301027">The article says although not specifically mentioned in this chapter, all disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the Armed Forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.721" offset="6334255">All conduct of a nature to being discredit upon the Armed Forces and crimes and offenses not capital may be subjected to a general or summary Court-martial and I must say that the tax evasion case that I referred to a few moments ago was tried under this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.651" offset="6401964">Now, I'm not going to raise the question of whether that section isn't so vague that it could hardly be upheld today but the citations, the references quoted by the Government and it was really a magnificent bit of research, all 115 cases or so listed in the appendix are suppose to be cases in which the general article was used to punish civilian crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.982" offset="6515336">Now, they start in 1775 and for example the first one is that a soldier was charged with stealing and the next one says, a soldier robbed Dr. Foster, general hospital, the third one says, soldier stole a hat from Captain Waterman (ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.109" offset="6575835">Now, these descriptions are so brief that you can't tell it all whether the men were on duty or off duty at the time of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.576" offset="6609690">One thing we can be sure, that the civilian courts were not open because these crimes took place in General Washington's army in 1775 in Cambridge, the first one, three weeks after the Battle of Bunker's Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.734" offset="6674265">In 1776 in New York, in 1777 in Morristown, in 1778 at Valleywood at Friedrichsburg, a New York town and then after the Treaty of Paris, they moved to the frontier where there are series of offenses against Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.604" offset="6729749">Now, no one is talking about the kind of a case where the army is on the military -- in the course of a military campaign in the United States or where there's a frontier battle going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.969" offset="6779277">Those situations are -- there are no resemblances at all to the situation and I think we're then talking about the war power, we have a situation which is really quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.458" offset="6821177">I might say that Winthrop in his authoritative work comes to a completely different conclusion with respect to the general article.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.965" offset="6855241">He says, it was never used except very, very sporadically on the frontier but aside from that, it was never used except to punish offenses of a military nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.108" offset="6903829">Now, if the history is not conclusive, then mindful of Mr. Justice Harlan's concurrence in Covert, I would like just to note this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.688" offset="6946147">In that opinion, the justice said that the crucial question is and I quote “which guarantees of the Constitution should apply in view of the particular circumstances, the practical necessities and the possible alternatives which Congress had before it?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.301" offset="7016573">Now, while that might have been a closed question in cases like Covert and Kinsella, there's nothing close about it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.641" offset="7049906">The particular circumstances of the cases -- case is that a soldier goes off base, off duty, commits a crime against a civilian in Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.884" offset="7082924">There's no reason at all why Hawaiian court can't try him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.762" offset="7102464">The practical necessities are exactly the same and the possible alternatives are obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.884" offset="7122944">No reason, no compelling reason in policy, no reason why the Constitution should not apply appeals in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.366" offset="7160874">Now, here of course, the Government also disagrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.306" offset="7176547">It says, the right of the soldier to be tried in the army community, that's the community he lives in and that's the community he should be tried in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.332" offset="7204655">Well, I wonder whether an average, non-commissioned officer tried by a Court-martial consisting of ranking officers, senior officers frequently officers with the rank of colonel or major or captain is being tried “in the army community”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.266" offset="7276440">The Government says, there may be different standards in the army.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.368" offset="7288874">Well, of course, there may be different standards in the army.</text>

            <text syncTime="1905.563" offset="7725641">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.577" offset="7737657">I think it's important that in this case, what we are discussing is a constitutional grant of jurisdiction to the Congress to legislate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.260" offset="7784364">Clause 14 of Section 8 of Article I provides that Congress has the jurisdiction to make rules for the Government in regulation of the land and naval forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.819" offset="7842670">It's our position that this power permitted Congress to legislate the specific provisions of the Uniform Code of military justice upon which Sergeant O'Callahan was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.773" offset="7902438">We submit that Congress does have a concurrent jurisdiction with the civil authorities to punish offenses committed by military personnel who are in active military status without limitation as to whether or not the offenses are committed on a military post or on duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.364" offset="7980805">In fact, the Uniform Code of military justice and the Articles of War of 1916 which in substances were effect until 1950 when the code was enacted had quite and have quite detail provisions relating to so-called non-military offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.586" offset="8061680">The code includes, of course, the offenses in question in this case, rape or attempted rape, assault, house breaking and also covers specifically most of the other principal offenses that servicemen might commit against the civilian communities such as murder, larceny, bad check offenses, drunken driving, reckless driving, disorderly conduct, breech of the peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.847" offset="8170768">As Mr. Rabinowitz has suggested, this jurisdiction has been exercised and is being exercised in a great many cases that arise both in the United States and abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.382" offset="8216952">In the United States, there are working arrangements between the military and the civil authorities, both the Department of Justice and state and local authorities which divide up the concurring jurisdiction that exists under the Uniform Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.085" offset="8295737">Generally speaking, the military does turn offenders against the civil laws over to the civil authorities if the civil authorities request it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2668.519" offset="10777475">The question is then whether the Government in regulation of the land and naval forces can encompass activities by soldiers beyond what in a narrow sense can be called military, obedience to orders, behavior information and things like that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2693.541" offset="10877576">Activities, actions of the kind in question of this case do have in a very real sense a military jurisdiction, a military significance that makes them a proper concern of the military forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.410" offset="10933060">The fundamental factor here is the fact that the military is and always has been in our society a kind of a unique community that is governed by rules and customs of its own and is separate from the civilian community and in some respects alien to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.336" offset="11020727">The real community of the people in the services is the community of other people in the services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.033" offset="11047476">It's not the civilian community where a particular military base with its transient personnel happens to be located.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.744" offset="11090317">Of course, the existence of the military unit in a civilian community presents certain problems for that community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.668" offset="11126053">Military people in fact are often a different kind of -- a different make up of ages and attitudes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.651" offset="11161997">There are frequently young people without local ties, without family roots in the community who in their free time do as a matter of practical fact create problems for that community and I think that that community rightly looks to the military to maintain some degree of control over what these people do in the community and of course a general discipline is something that's of enormous significance to an effectively functioning army and I think to the extent that soldiers at sometimes are off duty what they do during those off duty hours does have an impact on the operation of the military force and the existence of an effective discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.523" offset="11345481">One factor involved in civilian punishment of military offenders against the civilian laws is that those civilian punishments, the delays in civilian trials may well interfere with the operation of a military unit by making a man unavailable for transfer, unavailable for the performance of his military duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.156" offset="11447986">The army has special facilities, special abilities because of the nature of the community that it is for the punishment and the rehabilitation of member of the forces who may have gone astray.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.263" offset="11520397">In fact, because of the possibilities for limited restraint, it may well be that an appropriate punishment for a military man can be much more lenient than any punishment that would be available to the civilian courts and the civilian authorities.</text>

            <text syncTime="3062.789" offset="12354539">Yes that's certainly -- there are several stages of review within the military scheme and the sentences can in fact be reviewed all the way up to the top within the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.281" offset="12404485">Along this line, I think it is important to bear in mind that the Uniform Code and specifically the approach that has been taken by the Court of Military Appeals does assure military men virtually all of the constitutional rights that existing civil trials except of course for the requirement of indictment and the right to a trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.678" offset="12518066">With respect to the history upon which the petitioner put so much weight, we think that the research that is reflected in our brief does in fact show that the framers of the Constitution were familiar with or had reason to be familiar with the fact that Court-martials contemporaneously were being used to punish crimes which could not be regarded as purely military in the sense for which the petitioner contends.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.250" offset="12644394">To be sure, some of the crimes listed in the appendix to our brief, it may be a little hard to tell which they were but there are certainly a great many of them as to which it is clear that they were what the petitioner would call non-military or civilian offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.520" offset="12725478">For example, cashing a bad check in a civilian restaurant, rioting in town, fraud, assault of the civilian, I think it's fair to say that you simply can't say that the provision in the 1916 Articles of War laying out specific jurisdiction over specific non-military crimes were something noble.</text>
