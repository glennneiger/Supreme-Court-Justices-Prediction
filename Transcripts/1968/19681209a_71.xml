            <text syncTime="26.421" offset="209063">The Presbyterian Church in the United States, the petitioner, is a hierarchical church, sometimes called the Southern Presbyterian Church.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.952" offset="259218">The first step in the church government is the “Session”, composed of ruling elders and the pastor of the local church.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.697" offset="298193">The next is the “Presbyterian”, which is composed of representatives of local churches in a geographical area and also the ministers from those churches.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.198" offset="348139">Under the form of government of this church, a pastor of a local church is not a member of the local church but is a member of the Presbyterian.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.445" offset="405191">The next is the “Senate”, which generally but not always corresponds to state lines and which is composed of representatives of the local churches together with the ministers in the included Presbyterians.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.149" offset="475930">Next is the “General Assembly”, which is composed of representatives of Presbyterians, divided equally between ministers and laymen.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.870" offset="518875">This also constitutes the courts of each government church; the General Assembly being the highest court in the denomination.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.949" offset="563179">In April of 1966, the congregation of two local churches of this church voted to savor all connections will and remove themselves from all ecclesiastical control, jurisdiction and oversight of the Presbyterian Church in the United States and so notified the Presbytery of Savannah.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.864" offset="678849">The Savannah Presbytery then appointed an Administrative Commission under the law of the church with full authority to act on the premises and with special instructions to visit the ruling elders of each church - the ruling elders constituting the session, which as I have said is the governing body of the local church.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.861" offset="774771">After each elder in each church saved one, reaffirmed the action and after the pastor of each church had reaffirmed his renunciation of the Presbyterian church in the United States, the Commission, by a resolution, that’s the Administrative Commission of the Presbyterian, by resolution declared the pulpit of these church to be vacant because administers had savored all the connections with the church and assume the regional jurisdiction over these local churches in accordance with the Book of Church Order which is part of the record in this case and declared that Commission’s intention to secure ministers to provided regular services of worship in the sanctuaries of each of the two local churches for those members who wish to continue their membership and communion with the general church.</text>
