            <text syncTime="231.682" offset="1030144">Now, by reason of his poverty he was entitled to use a statute under which he could subpoena witnesses if he could show the trial court that the witness was material and necessary to the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.715" offset="1078209">He made application and the court granted the subpoena under the statute so apparently that was the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.225" offset="1104227">Now, the statute admittedly that he subpoenaed his witness under required him to make a preliminary showing of the necessity of this witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.844" offset="1146755">So, he went to trial court back in 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.348" offset="1160756">He applied for this witness and the subpoena was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.029" offset="1175489">It was sent from the county of trial approximately 165 miles away to the county of the residence of the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.227" offset="1208299">Now, this witness's name was Mr. Orsucci.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.489" offset="1225331">Mr. Orsucci lived in our City of Des Moines and the Sheriff in Polk County which is Des Moines, Iowa received this subpoena and did not serve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.222" offset="1276217">In fact he made a subpoena return indicating the witness could not be served and that the witness, Mr. Orsucci was confined in a mental institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.037" offset="1319476">Now, Your Honors, I'm very sorry to say this was not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.412" offset="1337031">In fact this witness, Mr. Orsucci, was at the very time of the subpoena return under lock and key of the very sheriff whose responsibility it was to serve the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.171" offset="1388022">Now, this fact that I'm now stating is beyond dispute in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.341" offset="1408711">So we have a purely legal question I think involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.251" offset="1424384">The records of the Polk County Jail were subpoenaed into the habeas corpus hearing below and I reflected them in our appendix here.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.198" offset="1456149">They demonstrate that this witness that was subpoenaed by the defendant was in fact during the course of the trial in the Polk County Jail at the relevant times.</text>

            <text syncTime="646.845" offset="2690800">And it seems to us that it is especially unseemly for the state to take this position when they have resisted his attempts to get this case in the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="662.390" offset="2752972">I think the record bears out that he has filed one habeas corpus after another.</text>
