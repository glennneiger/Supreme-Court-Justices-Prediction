            <label>Mr. Norman C. Amaker</label>
            <text syncTime="14.405" offset="162022">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.473" offset="170277">This case on appeal here from a three-judge Court for the Eastern District of Virginia presents two issues of first impression in this Court: One constitutional, the other statutory.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.023" offset="224507">Respecting the right of illiterates who, as a consequence of the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, became eligible to vote for the first time in Virginia and elsewhere to cast a secret ballot for the candidate of their choice and to have that ballot counted for their candidate just as every other qualified voter in the state of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.801" offset="327638">That constitutional question is whether these illiterates who, by the last census, were more than 3% of the persons in Virginia over 14 years of age, can, consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment, be barred, via Equal Protection Clause of that amendment, be barred from protecting their right to a secret ballot by use of a gum sticker bearing the name of the candidate of their choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.543" offset="438606">In face of a Virginia statute requiring that any write-in vote be in the voter's own handwriting, the statutory issue is whether the handwriting provision of this statute which is Virginia Code Section 24-252, the text of which is at page 2 of our brief and at page 68 (a) of the appendix, is a test or device prohibited by subsection 4 (a) of the Voting Rights Act, the complete text of that section is at page 5 -- begins at page 5 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.317" offset="585624">Our contention on the constitutional issue is that the Equal Protection Clause is violated, because illiterates who want to cast a write-in vote without disclosing the nature of that vote to state officials are prevented from doing so, while Virginia has provided for the protection of the secrecy of the ballot for other classes of voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.069" offset="692621">On the Voting Rights Act issue, we assert the refusal to count the illiterate's write-in ballots, which is what occurred here, as a denial of the right to vote, as defined in the Voting Rights Act of 1965, by using a prohibited test or device.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.580" offset="778721">Now, at the threshold, because this Court postponed decision as to jurisdiction, is the question of the Court's jurisdiction to decide these issues on this appeal?</text>
            <text syncTime="183.410" offset="838071">The appeal, of course, is based on 28 U.S.C. Section 1253, in that the appeal is from an order denying a permanent injunction in a civil action required to be heard and determined by a District Court of three judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.594" offset="918737">The argument that the case is one that is required to be heard by a three-judge Court is of course based on 28 U.S.C. Section 2281.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.215" offset="961264">The argument is in our brief beginning at pages 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.726" offset="979341">In sum, it is as follows:</text>
            <text syncTime="220.421" offset="986028">First, that 28 U.S.C. Section 2281 requires a three-judge court to hear a case seeking an injunction against the enforcement of a state statute on the ground of its unconstitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.284" offset="1049558">That is the claim that appellants presented to the District Court here.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.489" offset="1066381">Second, the complaint met the formal requirements for invoking the three-judge Court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.491" offset="1094384">The single district judge who received the application for the three-judge Court acted routinely on the application and, indeed, the three-judge Court itself never raised any question as to its jurisdiction and proceeded to decide the case on the merits of both the constitutional and the statutory issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.014" offset="1188425">Fourth, the appellees never raised any question as to jurisdiction in the District Court, and I do not understand their brief in this Court to be raising any question as to jurisdiction now.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.600" offset="1242760">Fifth, certainly, the constitutional question is a substantial one.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.065" offset="1260628">It's one of first impression and, consequently, it has not been foreclosed by any prior decisions of this Court, and the inclusion of the statutory claim under the Voting Rights Act did not operate to divest the three-judge Court of the jurisdiction that it acquired as a consequence of appellant's constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.404" offset="1366058">And finally, what is obvious, Virginia Code Section 24-252 is a statute of statewide applicability in Virginia, and so there is no question of dealing with a statute only local in application.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.702" offset="1435230">We also joined in our brief and arguments, beginning at page 28, an alternate jurisdictional ground under subsection 4 (a) of the Voting Rights Act, but it seems that the constitutional basis for the jurisdiction of the three-judge Court is sufficient and, with the Court's permission, I'd just like to pass on to the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.584" offset="1534704">Now, turning to the merits, I think it's important to state a couple of propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.374" offset="1561872">First, the Court is not being asked to rule on the question of whether the Fourteenth Amendment prevents a state from barring the use of stickers by all segments of the electorate at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.019" offset="1624461">Now, to the extent that the state courts, a handful of them, themselves have dealt with that question, the majority view has upheld the right to use stickers and those cases are cited both in our brief and in the brief of the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.515" offset="1694469">Nor is the Court being asked to deal with a question of whether Virginia had the right to set a voter qualification because the effect of the Voting Rights Act on this proceeding was to enfranchise illiterates.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.935" offset="1776180">So, the real question before this court is one of the state's responsibilities toward illiterates who are qualified voters with respect to two areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.401" offset="1822051">First, the preservation of the secrecy of their ballot and, second, with respect to the assurance, the certainty to them that the ballot will be counted for the candidate of their choice, thus, preserving their right to choose.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.255" offset="1885372">Now, these issues arise out of the following circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.081" offset="1920690">Samuel Tucker, a well-known Negro civil rights lawyer was running as a write-in candidate for Congress in the last congressional election in 1966 from Virginia's Fourth Congressional District.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.391" offset="1989966">Now, the Fourth Congressional District of Virginia is in an area that's commonly called Southside Virginia, and it is an area in which there exists the largest Black population in the state and also the largest percentage of the state's illiterates.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.292" offset="2077529">The last census indicated that persons over 14 years of age in that district, approximately 94,000, were persons who were illiterate and --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="508.034" offset="2136566">Over -- that was over 14 years of age?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norman_c_amaker" startTime="509.742" stopTime="523.155">
            <label>Mr. Norman C. Amaker</label>
            <text syncTime="509.742" offset="2143357">I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.334" offset="2145761">The figure I gave you, Mr. Justice Stewart, was for the State of Virginia at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.583" offset="2166763">The state as a whole had -- in the Fourth Congressional District had 22.9% of persons over 25 years of age.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="523.155" stopTime="525.901">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="523.155" offset="2197065">Who were illiterates.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norman_c_amaker" startTime="525.901" stopTime="859.432">
            <label>Mr. Norman C. Amaker</label>
            <text syncTime="525.901" offset="2208037">Now, on the ballot were listed two White candidates, the incumbent, Mr. Watkins Abbott who had been, to that point, serving in the Congress for 20 years since the 80th Congress, and his opponent, the republican candidate, Mr. Silva.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.452" offset="2282224">Now, Mr. Tucker, who had run in the previous congressional election and who was then listed on the ballot, did not qualify in time for his name to be listed on the ballot in this election and he was later urged to run as a write-in candidate by his supporters who were in the main Negroes who wanted no part of either candidate who was listed on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.627" offset="2390894">Now, they sought to maximize the vote for Tucker by inclusion of this relatively substantial number of newly enfranchised illiterates who, as the District Court found, were, and I think this language is of some significance, were registered voters but who were unable to spell accurately or to write legibly.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.442" offset="2486188">Now, as the Court found, just to consider the choices that confronted the persons in these situations, it seems to be there were three.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.812" offset="2515655">One, of course, was not to vote at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.426" offset="2530074">Second, of course, was to vote for someone whose name was on the ballot that they didn't want.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.332" offset="2553689">And, third, was to disclose their vote to White state election officials who, pursuant to Virginia law, are appointees of the dominant political parties in the state in an area like Southside Virginia, an area which includes Prince Edward County which is familiar to this Court from prior litigation, an area in which they could anticipate the kinds of things that the Civil Rights Commission reports has highlighted and, indeed, the kinds of things that were the -- resulted in the passage of the Voting Rights Act in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.031" offset="2708543">So, to solve the dual problem of being able to exercise a choice but, at the same time, trying to keep that choice hidden from the dominant White political apparatus which had opposed for decades the participation of Black members of the electorate, they used what to them was a very simple means of having printed gum stickers, just the form that I'm demonstrating here where this is plaintiff's Exhibit 1, it's in the record, which simply said S.W. Tucker.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.680" offset="2907073">The point being that the illiterate person, when he went to the polls, could simply tape, stick, put that on the ballot, fold his ballot and, in accordance with the Virginia procedure, hand it to the election official for deposit in the ballot box.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.173" offset="2993068">Now, the proposition that's urged by Virginia is that the use of stickers is per se invalid and apparently, in reading the District Court's opinion, that Court thought that this was a central issue in the case and that the Virginia legislature had forbidden their use in total.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.047" offset="3096618">But, I think this, of course, misses the point which is that once these persons were enfranchised by the Voting Rights Act of 1965, it became the Virginia's responsibility to provide some means for assuring the secrecy and the certainty of the ballot among all its qualified voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.738" offset="3203302">And, in fact, Virginia has, and prior to the 1965 Voting Rights Act, made accommodations with respect to these qualities with respect to other classes of voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.051" offset="3268608">Virginia's Constitution itself guarantees the right of secrecy of the ballot and there are several other provisions in the state's code, all of which fixed on the importance of keeping the ballot's secret, but Virginia has not done this in the case of these illiterates.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.277" offset="3353454">Rather, among all the voters who are qualified, it has set up classes of voters and discriminated among them both with respect to the question of the secrecy of the ballot, with respect to the assurance to the voter that his vote will in fact be counted for the candidate of his choice and in an additional respect too, particularly as regard to illiterates.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.778" offset="3471527">Virginia has made it easier for the illiterate to vote for a candidate whose name is listed on the ballot but it has made it -- it is discriminated with respect to an illiterate who chooses to vote for a candidate who's running a write-in campaign.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="859.432" offset="3542162">But the Virginia statute does try to make an effort to ensure the secrecy of the ballot of a write-in by an illiterate, by placing the judge who presumably goes into the voting booth with the illiterate making it incumbent upon him to regard the confidentiality of what the voter does and make it a crime if he doesn't, isn't that right?</text>

            <text syncTime="888.597" offset="3658773">No, that's not entirely right, Mr. Justice Fortas.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.919" offset="3668072">First of all, there is nothing incumbent in the statute which does that.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.865" offset="3687821">What you have reference to is in a vote-in which was sent by the Secretary of the State Board of Elections to all the judges of election in October of 1965.</text>

            <label>Mr. Norman C. Amaker</label>
            <text syncTime="924.103" offset="3800775">The -- now -- so, the question is what about the illiterates who desire to cast write-in votes, as did the appellants here, and when it's obvious that the -- there, under the state's own categories that they set up for protecting the secrecy of the vote, are the least-favored class.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.640" offset="3914982">Let's just see what these differences are with respect to each of the three things which I think are extremely important here, the question of secrecy, the question of what I call certainty or the surety that the vote will in fact be cast for the person that the person intends it to be cast for, and with respect to the difficulty between voting a listed as opposed -- voting for a listed candidate as opposed to voting for a write-in candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.221" offset="4033264">Now, of course, the literate voter is fully protected on all of these scores.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.226" offset="4061268">Whether it's a voting machine or whether it's a ballot box, he can vote in absolute secrecy.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.538" offset="4082584">He can, himself, assure that his vote is cast for the candidate of his choice and there is no discernable problem between voting for a candidate whose name is on the ballot as oppose to writing in a name, except the small amount of inconvenience that it takes to write the name.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.673" offset="4155099">Now, the statute that Mr. Justice Fortas referred to, 24 Section 251, it's reproduced in our brief at page 3, sets up other categories for voters who, in some sense, have to be -- had to be singled out for special treatment, and let's see what Virginia has done with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.666" offset="4247050">First, there's a category of a blind voter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.719" offset="4263246">Now, obviously, because the blind voter is under a special disability, Virginia has taken some steps to assure the capacity for him to make his vote effective in all these ways that I've indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.333" offset="4325731">But, what it has done is to say that the blind voter can be assisted in casting his vote either a write-in or voting for someone who's listed by a person who -- of his selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.104" offset="4388843">That person, of course, can be a trusted friend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.027" offset="4400546">It's done one additional thing which it hasn't done in the case of the illiterates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.075" offset="4420712">It has provided criminal sanctions to enforce the right of the blind voter to secrecy, the right of the blind voter to make sure that his ballot is in fact cast for the person that he intended it to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.708" offset="4487272">Now, the physically handicapped voter is one who can be assisted only by an election judge which he can designate, and there are criminal sanctions as in the case of a blind voter, but what the physically handicapped voter has to do then, even though he's protected with respect to being, himself, physically able to see how his vote is cast so that he can himself determine whether in fact the vote is being cast for the person that he intend it, he has to give up some measure of his secrecy but, again, there is a sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.602" offset="4662815">The same applies to that small, right now it's a very small, category of persons who were born before 1904, persons who would be over 80 years of age, persons who are rather registered before 1904, but the illiterate, under Virginia law as it presently stands, must sac -- for a sacrifice of his secrecy to a state official, if he chooses to vote in accordance with the election bulletin, there is no criminal sanction to enforce the -- his right of secrecy as opposed to the state election official.</text>

            <text syncTime="1612.088" offset="6552722">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.652" offset="6567037">As counsel for the various Virginia election officials in this matter, I should like to attempt to establish at the outset, that, if I may, just what this case involves and, perhaps, the best way to accomplish that is to draw the Court's attention to the opening paragraph of the opinion of the Court below which is on page 67 (a) of the appendix and which contains all of the operative facts, out of which this case arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.960" offset="6680200">In four brief sentences, the Court below has stated the entire case presented by the plaintiffs in the Trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.672" offset="6715099">It was to the effect, in sentence one, that plaintiffs are registered voters who are unable to spell accurately or write legibly, who attempted to cast a write-in ballot in the 1966 Congressional Elections in the Fourth District of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.800" offset="6775599">Second, each one attempted to do this by pasting on the official ballot a sticker in which the name of the write-in candidate had been printed and voting for the name printed on the sticker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.569" offset="6830665">Third, these ballots were not tabulated in the official returns for the write-in candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.769" offset="6867446">The fourth sentence begins “upon these undisputed facts, the plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that rights secured to them by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 have been denied.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.748" offset="6943410">Now, we submit that the only question that can be raised by that set of facts is whether or not the refusal of the Virginia election officials, pursuant to Virginia law, to count these votes which were cast by means of labels or stickers or pasters violated some right secured to illiterates in the Fourth District of Virginia, a right secured by the Fourteenth Amendment or by the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.837" offset="7067752">We know full well that the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States does not secure that right to anyone else in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.125" offset="7108921">The Fourteenth Amendment per se does not even secure to an illiterate the right to vote at all, much less to select the means by which he will vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.119" offset="7148837">And, the cases are perfectly clear that the matter of whether or not stickers and pasters shall be permitted as an appropriate means of voting is a matter to be determined by each individual state and regardless of whether the state permits it or rejects it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.282" offset="7205575">Neither determination of that question is violative of the Fourteenth Amendment, the case in the Seventh Circuit and the case of Morris versus Fortson in the recent case in Georgia, since the enactment of the Civil Rights Act clearly settles this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.939" offset="7272135">So, the assertion of the plaintiffs on this point is that, of all the people in the United States, they alone, as illiterates, have a constitutional right to vote by means of stickers and pasters.</text>

            <text syncTime="2972.154" offset="11992984">Specifically, in United States against Louisiana, that was true, and the Court added that nothing contained in this order shall affect any of the state provision relating to the casting of votes by the physically handicapped or the blind.</text>

            <text syncTime="3453.436" offset="13918104">With my few remaining minutes, the only response to this most recent revelation is that the bulletin -- the change in the bulletin is one which, obviously, was a time to anticipate, apparently, the presentation of the case here and there's nothing which, apparently, bars Virginia from changing the statute or changing the bulletin as it -- to its form or way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.625" offset="14046939">The election bulletin is, after all, only a regulation by the election officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.290" offset="14069509">There is just one small misstatement of fact that I'd like to call the Court's attention to, and that is that, in one of the cases cited by Mr. McIlwaine in which the District Court to require that assistance be given to illiterates, Morris v. Fortson, it was clear that the assistance could be given by persons other than state election officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.210" offset="14161251">The point with respect to the memorandum by the Solicitor General raising the Section 5 question seems to me to be resolved in this fashion, that assuming the regulation had been submitted to the Attorney General and the Attorney General had approved it, we would have this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.819" offset="14259681">Assuming that he had rejected the memorandum, you would have a situation where, as everyone agrees, Section 24-252 was suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.831" offset="14307746">And therefore, you would have precisely the same questions that are presented on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.069" offset="14328644">That is, in light of that fact situation, whether the right to a secret ballot could be preserved by some means and whether the means actually adopted in this case was a reasonable means to achieve that end.</text>
