            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">Number 163, Evelle J. Younger, appellant versus John Harris Jr. et al.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.685" offset="271109">Mr. Harris.</text>

            <label>Mr. Albert W. Harris, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="43.463" offset="278215">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.312" offset="289604">This is an appeal by the District Attorney of Los Angeles County in California from a judgment order of the District Court in Los Angeles, the three-judge District Court convene pursuant to a complaint filed by the appellees here holding the California Criminal Syndicalism Act void on its face in all of its provisions and particulars and regardless of how it might be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.824" offset="415723">In addition, the three-judge District Court issued an injunction against the District Attorney, Mr. Younger enjoining him from any further prosecution of John Harris who was then under indictment in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.081" offset="484686">In arriving at this conclusion one which has been appealed here by both the District Attorney who was the party below and the Attorney General of California, we contend that the District Court was wrong that the District Court should've dismissed the complaint to start with and if it did reach the question on the merits that the proper consideration of state law in California construing the Criminal Syndicalism Act would've required the Court to hold that the statute was constitutional and not unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.124" offset="648944">And we ask this Court which ever it might choose to do it or send it back for purposes of being dismissed because we don't think the proper case to start with or if you wish to reach the merits why we think you should hold it a valid statute in light of the California decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.688" offset="731178">Now, we say that the Court should've dismissed this complaint below without any further ado.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.335" offset="761689">John Harris had been indicted in September 1967 or September of 1966 and charged in two counts for violation of the Criminal Syndicalism Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.927" offset="816128">He was charged with passing up leaflets which advocated criminal means for bringing about changes in our society in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.498" offset="862417">The leaflets were appended to the indictments as usual under California procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.695" offset="891152">He was furnished the transcript of all of the testimony at the grand jury which shows the facts underlying the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.074" offset="924693">None of that is before you and now that was before the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.627" offset="950920">The -- unlike the case you heard argued here earlier, there were not related counts involving the possession of weapons or such things.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.704" offset="1003165">In addition, the Criminal Syndicalism Act should not be confused where the criminal anarchy statute in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.054" offset="1040572">They both stemmed from the same general idea and as does in Smith Act which of course you upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.951" offset="1076203">But the California Act instead of simply stigmatizing the advocacy of the forcible overthrow, the overthrow by force or violence of the Government speaks quite differently and it addresses itself to the advocacy of particular means of bringing about social change.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.303" offset="1149659">And it lists those means and it lists some very specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.188" offset="1165124">It refers to the commission of the criminal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.496" offset="1178394">It refers to sabotage.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.010" offset="1188425">It refers to unlawful acts of force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.408" offset="1205979">And it is only the advocacy of these criminal means, criminal ways of change -- bringing about changes in the society than as stigmatized.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.313" offset="1241610">The objective must be a change either in the political structure or a change economically.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.081" offset="1272748">The whole statute having been drafted at a time when the advocacy of economic change perhaps even disregard a political change was popular.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.330" offset="1321754">Your Honors have held recently without a case or controversy, the District Court has no jurisdiction -- it has no jurisdiction constitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.947" offset="1368148">We think as to three of these plaintiffs it was clear that the Court had no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.261" offset="1389464">Now, Harris filed this complaint and he was awaiting in the trial on his indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.883" offset="1415899">He had attacked the indictment in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.248" offset="1425408">He had asked the District Court of Appeal our intermediate Appellate Court for writ of prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.068" offset="1444634">It was denied there and he applied for hearing of the state's Supreme Court denied there.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.183" offset="1465114">Under our procedures the higher courts have discretion to rule on a matter of that kind or not as they see fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.348" offset="1489774">He certainly had he was not foreclosed from raising the constitutional question, later, if he was convicted in a normal appellate process but he went into the federal courts and perhaps sensing some problem under Section 2283.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.272" offset="1561454">He brought along some additional plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.183" offset="1577127">Two of them were members of the Progressive Labor Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.185" offset="1597085">Harris, I believe alleges and I think as some matter of fact was himself a number of the Progressive Labor Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.465" offset="1626237">And they said, they advocated some doctrine seeking change and industrial ownership and so forth and that they felt inhibited in attempting through peaceful none violent means to advocate their program.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.237" offset="1673362">And therefore, they wanted some relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.522" offset="1686528">Another plaintiff was brought in named Broslawsky who was a teacher at one of the state colleges out there and he said he taught about the doctrines of Karl Marx and he taught about the Communist Manifesto and even read from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.860" offset="1739818">By now, he was uncertain as to what he could say in light of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.537" offset="1758521">Now, these are the only plaintiffs before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.752" offset="1771374">The only action by the state that occurred is the indictment of Harris.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.631" offset="1794884">There have been no arrest, searches, no announcements, manifestos as you found in Dombrowski about what anybody is going to do to this group.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.197" offset="1837202">And as far as I know that any of these plaintiffs, they have never been with the exception of Harris of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.232" offset="1857369">They have never been charged with anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.116" offset="1872833">And indeed, the District Court after proceeding to find the California law unconstitutional on its face stated unequivocal that they were under no apprehension and that there was any danger whatever that these three people would be prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.377" offset="1945872">Or that the courts in California would entertain a prosecution on the grounds that they stated under complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.962" offset="1972203">Now, we say having said that they had no jurisdiction as far as these plaintiffs are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.120" offset="1992892">And we rely as were already mentioned here on your decision in Golden against Zwickler and we don't think these people had presented any kind of a case or controversy to the Court.</text>

          <turn speaker="albert_w_harris_jr" startTime="499.191" stopTime="628.357">
            <label>Mr. Albert W. Harris, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="499.191" offset="2101144">Exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.209" offset="2105219">And we argue some other things that there was no irreparable injury other than his own prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.674" offset="2127057">There was no pattern of prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.768" offset="2135416">There's not even any allegation that anybody else was bothered by this prosecution or was likely to be prosecuted or that anything -- any of all of the facts that you alluded to in Dombrowski were present.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.604" offset="2190796">We think specifically as to the injunction in connection with the prosecution of Harris that that is barred by Section 2283 and that is developed in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.451" offset="2238234">I don't want to go into that in much detail except to say this that this case presented a very excellent situation for the application of the abstention doctrine and for the -- so you can see the value of 2283 in failing to restraint a state court prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.203" offset="2333215">There are two complaints basically about the California statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.807" offset="2343664">One is that, that it is vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.147" offset="2348993">They don't know what it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.163" offset="2353068">The other one is that it's overbroad and it prohibits things that they should be allowed to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.106" offset="2376788">At least to them the contention of the -- of Harris and his fellow plaintiffs is that they don't have state decisions that have clarified these points.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.061" offset="2412628">Now, had the federal District Court declined to act on this case and have Harris ever been convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.325" offset="2433735">In the appeal, there's no question but that the -- any vagueness problem that there is, I'm not suggesting there is a vagueness problem -- they think there is could've been resolve by the state courts and in defining the conduct the area of conduct proscribed perhaps have removed completely the overbreadth question and thus remove complete any necessity of a constitutional adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.062" offset="2532686">Throughout the statute doesn't apply to what you might think is protected conduct and you‘ll have anything to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.421" offset="2558077">This case was a perfect vehicle for this to be done and not for the federal District Court to show what we think in all, with all due respect was unseemly haste in declaring the California state law unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="731.283" offset="3029535">No question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.579" offset="3042701">But I think in addition in Zwickler you had a very clear claim of simply overbreadth not of any really of any vagueness or only problem in vagueness in the statute that the contention was covered protected conduct and that was going to have to be reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.964" offset="3104246">In our case is quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.842" offset="3119815">Now, I would like to turn if I might to what I think is the more important question here and that is the merits of the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.308" offset="3169656">They say we think they should have dismissed it summarily but they didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.456" offset="3190241">The District Court of course recognized as we all recognized that the -- in Whitney against California this very court unanimously had sustained the statute that was here being enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.096" offset="3244784">But I think what they didn't do was recognized what had happened in California since Whitney had been decided and I think what they did not do was recognize that some of the very issues that were decided here were decided in Whitney and if you go back and read Whitney again, so you think -- may think of it as a discarded decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.483" offset="3354290">But the very same claim of vagueness that is raised here and which was the foundation for the judgment below was discussed at very great length in Whitney and that there was no division in the Court on that question -- Holmes -- Justices Holmes and Brandeis had no concern about the vagueness aspect of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.118" offset="3436837">They didn't it was vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.309" offset="3445614">And indeed, the only problem they saw in the case was that the defendant had not -- should've not an opportunity to show that there was no clear and present danger arising from her particular conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.125" offset="3492948">And they felt there was evidence that would show there was such clear and present danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.895" offset="3507994">That is the -- of some eminence of violence as I recall and so they joined in the opinion affirming the validity of the California Criminal Syndicalism Act or it has not been backed before the United States Supreme Court since that.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.213" offset="3577271">And it would be naive to suggest that their thinking about the First Amendment and about statute hasn't changed somewhat.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.701" offset="3599214">Although, the same test -- the same test that you used over and over again from the -- it's the Connolly decision about that people shouldn't have to guess it at the meaning of words.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.159" offset="3641010">That test was used in Whitney and (Inaudible) basically still the same test.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.409" offset="3662012">All right, nevertheless, there has been a certainly of some changes in the approach and in the thinking.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.584" offset="3686776">Well, this was recognized in California, it was recognized no less than in 1946, in the Danskin case.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.472" offset="3722303">A case which construed the Criminal Syndicalism Act in the light of changes in the laws since Whitney had been decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.326" offset="3753650">Chief Justice Treanor who was then an associate justice recognized specifically that there has been a lot happening since Whitney was decided and we got look at this again in light of what is happened since then and he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.451" offset="3802237">And he -- it's a long opinion and it discusses I think all of the cases that had intervened and all of the concerns that this Court has manifested over the years with the need for protecting free speech and drawing the line between free speech and illegal advocacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.082" offset="3880709">And he even in that opinion announced the test which is even stricter than your own Dennis Test.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.584" offset="3910698">He said that the danger arose by the speech had to be eminent and the danger had to be a danger that the state could properly prohibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.439" offset="3958136">And let me remind you again that the -- what is prohibited here was the advocacy of means unlawful acts, criminal acts, violent acts.</text>

            <text syncTime="997.010" offset="4092406">What is was, was a case reviewing the action of a local school board in applying the Civic Center Act in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.393" offset="4129917">That Act required a loyal deal in effect if you want to use a school room to hold a meeting and all that you did not or had not advocated the overthrow of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.528" offset="4170459">And it was argued in the state Supreme Court that the -- that this Civic Center Act in its all of its requirement was a supplement to the Criminal Syndicalism Act and it was to carry out the purposes of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.164" offset="4233049">And so in order to appraise that argument, Justice Treanor addressed himself to a Criminal Syndicalism Act what it meant and what it prohibited and anybody who is in any doubt about what it prohibits can find in that opinion what it does prohibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.648" offset="4307028">He made it very clear that it did not prohibit the advocacy of abstract doctrines, the discussion of abstract theory was never intended to do that and it doesn't do that and no one should be in any doubt in California about the reach of the Criminal Syndicalism law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1150.752" offset="4707432">The defendant gets a copy of it so everybody knows what's in it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1169.779" offset="4783501">But this whole incident occurred in April 1966 about six months after the great Watts Riots.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.690" offset="4819132">It grew out of the shooting and killing of a man named Leonard Deadwyler in Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.404" offset="4842015">He was a black man and it turned out he was taking his pregnant wife to hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.799" offset="4871586">Some confusion of the police officer and he sped away as I recall and the police officer chased him and later he corners him, stopped him and later corners inquest determined that the officer approached the car with a weapon being fearful of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.803" offset="4935638">He leaned on the door, the weapon went off and killed Mr. Deadwyler.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.246" offset="4949431">Now, there was great fear about that in the Los Angeles community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.928" offset="4980151">The District Attorney felt reviewing the case that that it was not a cause for an indictment but the people hadn't know what it happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.861" offset="5019857">And a corner's inquest was held that which all witness testified to what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.330" offset="5037725">I don't want to go into that but they started it and then they had to stop because it was just too much disorder and unruly behavior so they moved it from where you would normally hold an inquest where you'd have three or four people to the biggest courtroom and of course County Courthouse in Los Angeles and that is in some courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.635" offset="5106897">It's much bigger than this room and it holds several hundred people.</text>

            <text syncTime="1956.551" offset="7930629">A motion to dismiss was made by the state, an acceptance therefore of everything that was alleged in the complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="2019.406" offset="8182032">The Court therefore, felt it was obliged to reexamine Whitney in the light of the developing constitutional doctrine that had gone on since that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.317" offset="8217663">And it could only reach the conclusion that the statute on its face was clearly invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.357" offset="8245875">And this is not really disputed and the briefs in this by the appellant because what the effects say are really two aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.366" offset="8293836">One, that after all the state courts have interpreted the Criminal Syndicalism law and interpreted such a way as to satisfy First Amendment guarantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.688" offset="8351096">And that in any event some of the petitioners do not have standing and that the one Harris cannot obtain his injunctive relief because of Section 2283.</text>

            <text syncTime="2081.335" offset="8429777">And courts -- three-judge courts in Kentucky, in Mississippi, in Georgia have all declared this statute -- Criminal Syndicalism statute to be unconstitutional on their face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.972" offset="8492262">And I might say that some of the judges in their opinions have indicated that they couldn't concede of an argument that could today constitutionally support the validity of a Criminal Syndicalism statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.418" offset="8554120">And what is it therefore that the appellant really is arguing here?</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.130" offset="8572928">The first, the argument is made that three of my appellees don't have standing that a case of controversy is not presented.</text>

            <text syncTime="2158.966" offset="8740216">This teacher feels inhibited, uncertain as to what he can and cannot teach without defending this law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2710.523" offset="10946518">And the construction there is broad and is not restricted and does not follow the constitutional doctrines enunciated by this Court interpreting the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.681" offset="10987165">I might say following Danskin, counsel has pointed out that Danskin came, the issue was not directly presented and all the courts were simply saying if you're trying to implement this Criminal Syndicalism law, of course there got to be a clear and present danger and of course the American Civil Liberties Union and wants to use this school auditorium does not express in present danger and that was it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.899" offset="11068040">But if you read all of the decisions as I read it in 22 and 23 of my brief and read the decision that followed almost by 10 years the decision in Danskin and that is Black against Cutter Laboratories where Mrs. Walker and I quote from it on page 22, “was a member of the Communist Party whereupon the Supreme Court of California said that constitutes a violation of the California Criminal Syndicalism Act per se”.</text>

            <text syncTime="3283.765" offset="13239442">Mr. Harris, have you got any examples of federal court in a declaratory judgment action like this attacking a state statute of declaring the statute to be unconstitutional insofar as it reaches some things that it shouldn't reach but leaving it but saying it is constitutional in other respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.563" offset="13350619">For example, if the claim is that this statute is overbroad and reaches some kinds of teaching that it shouldn't which I gather is essentially the claims, isn't it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.287" offset="13397535">And the federal statute, can the federal court say, yes, we agree that the federal statute is -- that the state statute is unconstitutionally overbroad and insofar as that reaches these forbidden areas that it is unconstitutional and stop vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.460" offset="13478201">Normally, I -- as I understand it to the federal court has said that it finds it overbroad if it strikes down the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3419.999" offset="13784357">Well, no but no -- they are the state court and I don't think they should in that sense try to be one but no lawyer that I know of picks up a statute and looks at it and says, “Well, here's the word “teach.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.734" offset="13843289">So, it's going to have something to do with teaching in a classroom.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.229" offset="13857290">None of these construes statutes like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.082" offset="13864709">First thing we do is look at the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.397" offset="13874009">We start to look at the cases and I suggest what the District Court didn't do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.980" offset="13896265">Here, had it done that I think I would've concluded that as construed and as narrowed in the state construction this statute is perfectly valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.119" offset="13932837">I say it's a valid on its face as has been construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.722" offset="13947256">But even if you weren't satisfied and you thought Danskin was devoted to something else and the other cases are old and so forth, still and all I think that court has a duty to construe the statute to uphold it and not to strike it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.163" offset="14001068">And this Court said so in Fox against Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.603" offset="14018832">And these are words, we may use the same words that you've upheld time and time and time again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.285" offset="14041506">And now, I think to turn around, you can say the two vague or overbroad we don't understand them would be contrary to your own decisions absolutely unnecessary for the protection of anybody's rules.</text>
