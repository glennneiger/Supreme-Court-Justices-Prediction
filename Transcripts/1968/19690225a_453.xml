            <text syncTime="32.133" offset="231946">My name is Dean Richards in Indianapolis, Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.598" offset="245739">Because the facts of this case can be summarized easily, I will begin with a brief summary.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.651" offset="273951">The petitioner was convicted of a crime in the Western District of Kentucky Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.358" offset="296835">Immediately after the jury returned its verdict without pause or recess, the Court ordered the petitioner before the bench to take -- the Court asked if the petitioner had any res -- comment to make and, after a brief response, the petitioner had been quiet.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.350" offset="384815">At this time, the Court started to make final disposition of the case and, at this time, defense counsel asked that a presentence investigation be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.317" offset="428596">The Court, interrupting counsel, stated that a presentence investigation had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.582" offset="453674">It was before him and he had read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.307" offset="464645">And then, the Court pronounced sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.946" offset="483140">This was complained of in a direct appeal to the Sixth Circuit and the findings and holdings in the Sixth Circuit were that there was no basis for inferring prejudice from the facts that the district judge had seen the presentence investigation report prior to the time when the jury returned its verdict, and the district judge sentenced the defendant immediately thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.213" offset="596198">Upon -- counsel, upon noting that in a Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals case, Collin versus United States, and a summary case, in fact, the Court held just the opposite, in that, in the Seventh Circuit case, the Court stated that the facts in the record before us effectively rebut the presumption of prejudice from an apparent violation of rule 32 (c) (1).</text>
