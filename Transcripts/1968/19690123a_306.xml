            <label>Mr. Kenneth L. Anderson</label>
            <text syncTime="32.656" offset="234036">Thank you, Your Honor, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.377" offset="248874">This is antitrust suit filed by me and the Federal District for the Western District of Kentucky in 1962 charging the respondents, United States Steel Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary U.S. Steel Homes Credit Corporation with conspiring to violate Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.473" offset="349288">The background of the case is that in December of 1959, Mr. A, B, Fortner of Louisville, Kentucky had an interest in a number of corporations and he had been involved in the real estate business, the real estate development business since approximately 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.960" offset="431208">In the period immediately prior to this December 1959 term, Mr. Fortner and one of his business associates and another corporation had commenced development of a subdivision in the Louisville, Kentucky in Jefferson County area.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.833" offset="502680">They had in fact, prior to December of 1959, built 250 conventional homes in this subdivision which was called Golden Meadow Subdivision.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.592" offset="545729">In December of 1959, Mr. Fortner was approached by representatives of the United States Steel Corporation and their Homes Division which manufactures prefabricated homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.334" offset="604662">These are house packages that they deliver in a -- on a truck or trailer van and the builder has people there to erect the homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.594" offset="649697">Now when these people approached Mr. Fortner they approached him on the premise that there were substantial financing benefits to be derived from this second conspirator and we charged her in this case the -- what I call the Credit Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.586" offset="737677">This was a financing subsidiary and its purpose at the beginning was to aid the dealer builders of the Homes Division at U.S. Steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.567" offset="789608">As we indicate in our brief, this purpose got extended in 1958 just before they -- about a year before they started talking to Mr. Fortner and they decided that they were going to use the financing as their own people have described it as a tool to obtain sales of these prefabricated homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.279" offset="880515">So Mr. Fortner had numerous discussions with these people and financing offers I believe in construing the evidence of course where we are basically talking about whether the summary judgment should have been given against this that the evidence should be construed most favorably to our side and not the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.832" offset="958673">And I think that the inference most reasonably to be drawn from this record is that this financing offers according to Mr. Fortner's affidavits kept getting better and better to the point that they offered Mr. Fortner a 100% money to buy the land and develop the land that had not been develop that was left in the remainder of the subdivision, that they also were going to provide its construction money.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.782" offset="1066506">All at a 6% interest in 1/2 points, now there are substantial differences between this financing of a 100% at 6% in 1/2 point and other financing available, I believe, generally through out the eastern portion of United States and certainly in Louisville, Kentucky area during this time to dealer builders or to builders.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.469" offset="1169220">The conventional development and land purchase loan as their own documents show was a 60% loan not a 100%.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.757" offset="1202448">The other manufacturers who were supposedly in this financing business also were offering 6% interest but 10 points.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.735" offset="1246333">So that when this offer came to Mr. Fortner this was on exceedingly attractive proposition to him.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth L. Anderson</label>
            <text syncTime="392.169" offset="1672025">So that this was substantially attractive proposition to this man who is in business and he has a corporation in existence which is called Fortner Enterprises, Inc.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.768" offset="1722493">That corporation had been in existence for sometime.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.550" offset="1733569">It has other businessmen do have a corporations available from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.709" offset="1758229">The land that was to be the subject matter of this arrangement was available in another corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.066" offset="1783620">So that when it got to the point of this transaction being consummated, this corporation then had sold to it by the other corporation the land on which they were going to build these homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.466" offset="1853210">Now, the kicker in the case of course and these people started out talking to Mr. Fortner about homes and the whole idea of this thing was you got to take their homes if you're going to borrow this money on these favorable terms from us.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.908" offset="1919039">So, they prepared three sets of documents a loan agreement, a mortgage, and a set of notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.001" offset="1951326">And the loan agreement is the key document here because that loan agreement specifically provides that on each lot in the subdivision which is the subject matter of these loans that there will be erected a prefabricated house manufactured by United States Steel in its Homes Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.692" offset="2030111">Now, this loan agreement itself was an agreement between the Credit Corporation and Fortner Enterprises, Inc. United States Steel was not a party to this agreement, they were a third party, obviously beneficiary of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.722" offset="2086222">The loan agreement goes on to provide that if the borrower Mr. Fortner and his corporation doesn't do various things like pay on the notes and so forth including if the borrower shall otherwise fail to comply with the terms of this agreement or with the terms and provision of the notes or mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.654" offset="2177964">Then in any such a debt, at the option of the lender all obligation on it's part to make further advances on account of the loan shall cease and the lender may enter into possession of the premises and perform any in all work and labor necessary to complete set improvements and direct said dwelling houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.525" offset="2249435">In the said dwelling houses that they are referring to are the U.S. Field Homes prefabricated houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.731" offset="2274304">So they entered into this transaction Mr. Fortner has stated in his affidavit which is in this record that he would not have purchased these homes but for the unique character -- the attractive to him as a consumer and businessmen character of the loans that were offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.222" offset="2364270">He started his project, the record shows quite clearly that they spent large sums of money on advertising that they did, all of the things necessary to get the project going in a proper manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.688" offset="2418082">That there were delays in deliveries, that there were problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.290" offset="2432502">A second loan was made and at the time that the second loan was consummated to cover some additional lots in the subdivision that became available there had been nine closings according to the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.976" offset="2495300">Then after this loan was consummated which did get some additional capital into the corporation things really began to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.282" offset="2524453">And this is where we get the damage to Fortner Enterprises because the houses as they were occupied began to reveal substantial defects.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.118" offset="2571891">They couldn't get along and the reputation of the subdivision started going bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.331" offset="2588714">Mr. Fortner's salesmen started not wanting to come out and sell the houses because of the wavy walls and the sink tubs that would swell up.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.817" offset="2630614">So Mr. Fortner called these people and said “Look I will meet every term of this loan agreement, our people will pay off this loan agreement, the money that you've loaned us but please relieve us of the restrictive provision in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.859" offset="2714833">Let us build conventional homes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="654.986" offset="2723297">This was refused, this was in December of 1961 or January of 1962, matters kept getting worst.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.370" offset="2756838">So Mr. Hamilton wrote the Homes Division a letter saying, we just can't live with this things and they had a meeting.</text>

            <text syncTime="2205.812" offset="8926647">Subject to the wishes of the Court I planned that the bulk of my argument today to what conceive to be the central legal issue in this case, that issue turns upon the first of the two elements requisite the proof of a Sherman Act per se time violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.803" offset="8998536">Specifically the question raised is this, if the court drawing every reasonable inference in favor of the plaintiff concludes that the evidence shows that defendants financing of the plaintiffs was one more favorable terms that are available from any other source, there's that fact standing by itself established the requisite sufficient economic power over the tying element to appreciably restrain trade in the tied product, here prefabricated homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.064" offset="9139597">First, I would like to touch briefly upon the facts and two subsidiary issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.102" offset="9163734">The plaintiff has argued that summary judgment was inappropriate but discovery was full and complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.743" offset="9194350">To my knowledge there was never any claim by plaintiff that additional facts needed to be put in the record, there was never any request when the defendant summary judgment motion was filed for additional time to prepare affidavits or otherwise come forward with the showing that Rule 56 (e) requires that there is evidence on material facts in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.178" offset="9292048">In addition, the plaintiff has advised this Court as it did the courts below that all of the evidence essential to its case is in the record now before the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2422.734" offset="9794330">Very well, Your Honor and I would say before attempting to answer to this question we do urge that regardless of the basis for the District Court's decision in reliance upon Helvering and Gowran on the unbroken line of precedence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.952" offset="9855143">In a summary judgment situation such as urged here where only questions of law are presented to the reviewing court both the Court of Appeals and this Court, whether or not the grounds stated by the District Court were right or leave out or ambiguous, this Court is as fully able as the District Court was to reach the purely legal conclusions that are necessary in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.378" offset="9952841">In essence, I think the one aspect to the District Court decision which plaintiff has most frequently pointed to as suggesting that there was a misconception on the part of the district judge as to what was requisite to establish a cause of action for per se time violation under Section 1 whether embellished or not by a Section 2 conspiracy to monopolize charge was the District Court's reference to the amount of land that was affected by the arrangement between these parties in comparison with the total land that was available in Louisville, Kentucky for house developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.734" offset="10090350">I would urge that clearly that market fact by itself should not be determinative in a per se time situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.325" offset="10128697">I would urge equally strongly however, that the fact is clearly not irrelevant to the facts of the these cases where the tying arrangement is one between if you will a raw material supplier and his dealer, a middleman who is taking the houses and then making them available to the ultimate consumers, the house residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.358" offset="10212812">I submit that in terms of a full analysis of this kind of tying arrangement it is a appropriate to look to the question where other prefabricated house manufacturers were the sellers of conventional house building materials and any significantly way excluded from the market whether it's confined to Louisville, Kentucky or more broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.121" offset="10303822">Now, if I may try to articulate our position, so that the Court understands clearly why we urge that summary adjustment judgment is appropriate on this case, I will proceed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2638.289" offset="10656580">I believe that your decision in Walker process, three terms ago, indicates that in attempt our conspiracy to monopolize the relevant market is an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.541" offset="10693569">As I believe Mr. Justice Brennan's question suggest correctly there would be a most substantial case of question in this case as to whether the market can be limited to prefabricated houses or whether the element of cross-elasticity of demand does not bring conventional houses into the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.909" offset="10763055">Now, on that in essence is my argument under conspiracy to monopolize a part from my principal argument that the kind of conspiracy to monopolize which I understand the plaintiff to be urging now was never urged before either the District Court or the Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="3218.238" offset="12976358">To come to back to the central contention by the plaintiff, it's very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.847" offset="12994748">It claims that because the financing extended by defendant require the plaintiff to place no equity into the land portion of the loan commitment which was something else than 15% of the total commitment extended by the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.033" offset="13055457">This was more favorable and available from any other source and therefore within the meaning of the Loew's case was unique and consequently establishes the requisite sufficient economic power over the tying element.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.823" offset="13110627">Our contention very simply is that as a matter of logic supported by the decision of this Court, you cannot infer simply from the fact that the time element is offered on more favorable terms than available elsewhere that there is economic power in that tying element.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.112" offset="13187845">Now coming Mr. Justice White to the Loew's decision, as this Court well knows it involved the block-booking of copyrighted movie films.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.376" offset="13224835">It held that the requisite economic power over the time element, it presumed when the tying element is either patented or copyrighted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.060" offset="13267571">Moreover, as the Court well knows, the tied products there were frequently forced upon unwilling purchases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.480" offset="13301321">Now, outside the patent and copyright areas, I urged that the Court has not defined uniqueness and I concede my inability to tell this Court what it meant when it use the term unique in the Loew's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.161" offset="13360044">I would urge however that to the extent that it coupled with that a reference to desirability to consumers, I think that this must as a matter of common sense than intended by the Court to mean something more than desirable in the sense that one consumer buys 10 cents worth of a tying element.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.017" offset="13431411">That would establish sufficient economic power and practically every product is sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.699" offset="13450219">I think the Court meant something in terms of some in addition of meaningful economic power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.916" offset="13479058">Indeed, the Court has never merely assumed the existence of economic power and I would point to the other significant tying decisions of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.085" offset="13519705">Times-Picayune examined market share and it was held there that 40% was not a dominant position when the other two sellers each had 30% of the relevant market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.436" offset="13569128">Now, in Northern Pacific, the Court found substantial economic power the tying land on a combination effective specifically the extensive landholdings of the defendant there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.960" offset="13627225">Secondly, the strategic location of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.369" offset="13648854">Third, the land was frequently essential to the businesses of the buyers and lessees who were subjected to the tying conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.577" offset="13685635">Fourth, the host of tying arrangements affected by the defendant without any reasonable explanation for the existence of the restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.351" offset="13720743">And finally, this Court concluded that the defendants' purpose there obviously was to fence out competitors and the nature of the tie was that the fencing out would be for an indefinite period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.082" offset="13771734">It was the sale of land where the covenant running with the land indefinite leases of long terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.249" offset="13800364">Now, concededly there may be cases where economic power over the tying element can be inferred indirectly from proof that the buyers were economically coerced to accept knowingly an inferior burdensome or noncompetitive tied product.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.117" offset="13879881">But pointing back to the facts or the absence of facts that I've tried to bring to the Court's attention a moment ago, here in this case, there is no evidence that the plaintiff consider the defendants' houses the tied product to be of this character when it negotiated the arrangements now challenged, consequently we urged this is not a case of economic coercion.</text>

            <label>Mr. Macdonald Flinn</label>
            <text syncTime="3644.266" offset="14680482">My argument -- my argument Mr. Justice is that the economic coercion, if it arises as in the tying case exists at the time the parties effectuate the arrangements between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.045" offset="14727502">It is only in terms of the buyer's state of mind at that time that you can ascertain whether or not there was economic coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.853" offset="14762820">Now, to go on with your question, it seems to me that if your question fairly states the plaintiff's position that he could not have gotten into the building business through any other financing media but for the more favorable terms obtained from the defendants, then the case is dispose off automatically without getting into the question of sufficient economic power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.833" offset="14850696">It follows that there was no foreclosure of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.857" offset="14862817">This plaintiff would have been unable to buy any competitor's prefabricated houses, any competitor's conventional house building materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.091" offset="14903777">Now, we fully recognized that this Court approaches tying arrangements quite properly so with suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.895" offset="14930944">Indeed, the Court has repeatedly said that they serve hardly any purpose beyond discretion of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.857" offset="14958843">At the same time, even under the more easily established standards of Section 3 of Clayton Act that Court has recognized the tying arrangements are not inevitably anticompetitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3725.395" offset="15004923">And without going into the details we respectfully refer the Court to the Sinclair Refining case which is cited at some detail in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.607" offset="15037837">We urge that where a tying product is claimed to be unique solely because it is offered at a lower price or on more favorable terms, it cannot logically be inferred from that fact standing alone that there is a sufficient economic power over the tying element to constitute a per se violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.410" offset="15112965">I would ask the Court to consider the following few examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.112" offset="15127803">A buyer may take a tied product as the condition of paying a lower price for the tying product, simply because he considers the package to offer the best available terms for the combination of products he wants not because the seller has economic power over the tying element or because the buyer is coerce to take a tied product that he does not want.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.489" offset="15221321">Indeed, the fact that the tying product must be offered on more favorable terms, may suggest that it lacks even competitive parity in part of the tying product.</text>
            <text syncTime="3790.906" offset="15266983">Further, even a seller with no economic power may use a tying product is a lost leader to promote the sale of the tied product by selling the tying product at a loss, in effect he reduces the prices of the tied product that he is selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.390" offset="15332916">Now, we respectfully submit that in Northern Pacific, this Court appears to have recognized that offering the tying product on more favorable terms may imply the absence of economic power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.684" offset="15386102">Specifically, the majority opinion there appears to have given weight to the fact that that the defendant there made no claim that the tying land came any cheaper than if the tying condition had not been imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3835.120" offset="15443884">Finally, my time is about to expire, we ask the Court to consider the particular nature, the tying element involved here, financing, a commitment to lend money credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.624" offset="15489860">If this case has any significance for others than the parties to it, it is most likely in connection with this respect, with this aspect of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3855.946" offset="15527163">Dealer, financing by sellers upon the condition of the seller's goods be purchased is widespread in the business community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3863.979" offset="15559241">Indeed, we argue that it is inevitable because every sale on credit involves a tie-in, financing by the seller upon the condition that the buyer purchase the seller's goods, unless the seller either increases his price for his goods or recovers in the form of interest the full cost of his foregoing prompt receded the funds, he has reduced the price of his goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="3891.552" offset="15669582">If the seller offers credit or financing on more favorable terms than available elsewhere, to that extent, he has also reduced the price of his goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="3901.097" offset="15707721">We submit that such financing, unique because offered on more favorable terms than available elsewhere is price competition in the goods sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3910.583" offset="15745755">As such, the financing challenge by the plaintiff here was an integral element of the price of the defendants' prefabricated houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3918.836" offset="15778670">For all of these reasons, we submit the judgment below should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.688" offset="15794134">If the Court has no further question, I shall conclude Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
