            <label>Mr. William Ross Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="10.115" offset="143862">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.032" offset="159535">This is a case that comes up on a petition under Section 2255, a federal prisoner who claims that he was in improperly denied his right of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.037" offset="215542">His petition alleges that he is a Mexican descent and did not speak the language well.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.290" offset="252531">The trial was conducted through an interpreter at the conclusion of the trial and at the time -- after the time of sentence, the prisoner alleged that he requested the interpreter to ask the court and to ask his counsel to arrange for his appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.598" offset="333720">He also alleges that his counsel agreed to do so and that an oral notice of appeal if there is such a thing was given but no written notice conferring to the statute was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.235" offset="404355">The prisoner originally and within six or seven weeks at the time of the sentence filed what I suppose you would call an application for a late appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.774" offset="462451">That was denied by Judge MacBride, the District Judge in Sacramento, and by the Circuit Court of the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.595" offset="501739">Upon the grounds that under the rule of the Ninth Circuit, an application for a right of appeal late where a prisoner claimed that he had been not -- been denied that right of appeal must also show some basis for the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.296" offset="592541">In other words, it must show not only that he was deprived of that constitutional right but he must show that he have something upon which some reasonable basis upon which to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.918" offset="647084">The -- those proceedings were in 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.967" offset="667251">In 1966, the prisoner then filed an application under Section 2255 and that application was very much more detailed than the previous ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.111" offset="719809">So, he had apparently risen in the hierarchy of the jail and there had been there long enough to learn little more English and it was a -- that was a better job than the first one.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.302" offset="776547">There again and without hearing, without reference to the transcript, without reference to his counsel and without reference to the United States Attorney, Judge MacBride denied that application.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.116" offset="843839">And there again, he was -- he then filed his motion to have the appeal heard in forma pauperis in the Court of Appeals and -- for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.833" offset="894725">The Court again without hearing denied that motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.204" offset="920221">Again on the basis of the rule in the Ninth Circuit that in addition to showing the deprivation of the right to appeal, a prisoner must show something more.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.109" offset="983855">At least must show the basis of an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.980" offset="1011336">The cases in California in our circuit are not wholly clear whether he has to show conclusively or whether he has -- they talked in -- the judge here talked about rights constitutional or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.906" offset="1083016">But in any event, it is clear that there are circuits differing from most of the circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.053" offset="1107571">A prisoner claiming his deprivation of his right to appeal must show that he, if granted that right, has at least a reasonable basis upon appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.304" offset="1160547">Now, in the application for the -- there are the motion or application for the writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.706" offset="1194193">The prisoner set forth these facts, the Solicitor General in his opposition felt that a prisoner should at least show something that would indicate some basis for an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.015" offset="1255424">In our opening brief, I pointed out that here was a prisoner of Mexican descent having very little knowledge of the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.248" offset="1296384">He was tried with five -- four or five other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.100" offset="1311744">At least two or three of whom had separate counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.803" offset="1326582">The whole proceeding was conducted through an interpreter and how in the heaven's name, a person under those circumstances would be able to recognize and remember what errors occurred at the trial that might give him some basis for an appeal seemed to me an impossibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.950" offset="1411218">I think in the Solicitor's brief, they have in effect waived that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.540" offset="1437550">They seem not to rely any further upon the -- on the basis that something should be done that the prisoner must do -- to show something beside the actual deprivation of his right of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.339" offset="1504737">The brief of the Solicitor for the United States in this case, seems to have waived that point and they really talking about whether this prisoner should now have a hearing or whether the -- this Court should send this matter back to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.029" offset="1599509">We have to permit the District Court to interrogate the -- and take affidavits from the trial lawyer that this man have or whether he has to bring the prisoner down from McNeil's Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.425" offset="1661053">We're talking I think now only of mechanics.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.359" offset="1676831">Now, my view of the matter and I think, I can express it easily is that if we take the rule of the board of case which as described in the Hannigan simply says that, a prisoner who is deprived of his right of appeal or a prisoner's right of appeal with the 10-day period during which that right must be exercised does not commence to run until such period as the prisoner is effectively represented by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.190" offset="1832103">Now, after our original brief, I obtained from the court reporter in Sacramento the transcript of the last day of the trial, that is to say the transcript of the day upon which this prisoner was sentenced, this prisoner and the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.872" offset="1934817">Only enough that transcript showed no oral notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.115" offset="1963865">Although, the lower court and the Circuit Court, in our circuit, had both said it was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.794" offset="2002526">In other words, we have a judicial finding based on no fact whatever and obvious result of not even looking at the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.144" offset="2039933">However, the transcript does contain a very much more important in -- on page 3 of the appendix to my reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.575" offset="2081625">The counsel then act -- makes a motion not in very good language but he said, it is just proceeding in forma pauperis in behalf of Adolpho Rodriquez and Etta Rodriquez while they are before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.863" offset="2154872">Hereafter, pardon me, if they are transported away, we would have to have them returned to make a motion before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.148" offset="2200012">Judge MacBride then says, no, I don't wish to take up that matter at this -- that motion of this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.437" offset="2221119">Its five minutes after 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.343" offset="2228746">We've taken all morning on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.221" offset="2240240">I have no idea what's your motion is and all motions have to be writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.972" offset="2259257">Well, it was clear at that moment that the counsel who had been retained by Rodriquez and his wife for the trial was advising that Court that he was stepping out.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.140" offset="2315891">You know the only purpose in making a motion of that sort was to indicate to the Court that he was through to that lawyer, Mr. Miley was finished and the motion for -- to proceed in forma pauperis could only mean that he was in effect suggesting to the Court that he was through -- the Court should appoint new counsel and permit the man to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.378" offset="2424874">Now, Section 37 (a), the Rule of 37 (a), says very clearly that if a prisoner is not represented by counsel then the Court must advice him of his right to appeal and the clerk must enter the notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.860" offset="2510764">Now, it was -- it would have been perfectly simple to have accomplished that purpose at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.766" offset="2546395">Now, we're five or six years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.135" offset="2563950">Yes, six years later, he's been in jail for six years, it seems to me perfectly clear that on the basis of the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.020" offset="2607417">The Court can well then state that the prisoner's right to appeal commences, at such time as the Court in Sacramento appoints for him counsel and permits him then to enter his appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.363" offset="2704802">Now, I think there is no point my discussing the rule in the Ninth Circuit where I think because of their desire in the Circuit the very proper one to prevent repetitious applications under Section 2255.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.663" offset="2785991">They laid out a lot of rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.651" offset="2793932">I think the lower courts misunderstood that that case somewhat but in any event, while I can only agree with the courts in their desire to prevent to the extent they can, repetitious petitions under Section 2255 that has nothing to do with the right of a prisoner to be secure in his right of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.414" offset="2936978">Now, this is not a case that can easily arise again because as Your Honors well know under the change of rule no matter whether the prisoner is represented or not any long.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.207" offset="2992149">The Court's all now -- all advise him of his right of appeal and if counsel is not going to take it, the Court simply instructs the clerk to enter the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.024" offset="3039483">So that we are talking about a situation that certainly is not one that plague us in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.902" offset="3066964">This is a simple situation of a man having very little knowledge of the language whose trial counsel was not willing apparently proceed pass the trial who attempted to make clear to the trial Court that he was withdrawing and whose failure and I think in a very serious failure on the part of counsel was that he fail to file the proper motion either that afternoon or on the following day.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.210" offset="3192247">He did nothing further --</text>

            <text syncTime="804.797" offset="3322546">Now, I think we have this odd situation the -- in the first time this came up Judge MacBride said in his first opinion that the prisoner claimed that he had made an oral notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.699" offset="3410213">The case then went up before Judge Chambers and Judge Bone in the circuit and somehow or another Judge Bone, I think, wrote the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.922" offset="3455039">Judge Bone said the right that notice of appeal, oral notice of appeal was given by retained counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.086" offset="3499760">That was the basis of that matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="857.503" offset="3533406">No, then it came down again before on the Section 2255 application before Judge MacBride and Judge MacBride then said that an oral notice had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.527" offset="3585442">It goes back going up to the Circuit and Judge Jertberg and I forgot who else was on that panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.593" offset="3613759">They then affirm again that this oral notice was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.375" offset="3628910">I can find the oral notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.386" offset="3640926">On the other hand, I can understand perfectly well that a Mexican prisoner would think that this motion that the man was making under his forma pauperis motion was just that and obviously it was intended as that.</text>

            <text syncTime="908.479" offset="3737266">The prisoner to appear in forma pauperis, if he is just go on to the jailhouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.739" offset="3758373">There's no purpose of his having the motion made except to have counsel appointed for him so he could appeal and he have no other purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.784" offset="3802467">Otherwise, he's got his 20 years in the federal prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.856" offset="3834755">It seems to me one of the clearest cases that I know of, of a failure for whatever reason of counsel to protect the right of his client to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.857" offset="3902777">Now, I can understand Judge MacBride had been a long five, six weeks trial conducted through interpreters with a lot of lawyers and he was a little weary, I guess himself and shot the man off before he had completed his motion now.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.885" offset="3974875">That does not I think excuse counsel, his retained counsel for not completing that motion and making it in writing and making it wholly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.072" offset="4031613">On the other hand, it seem -- it would seem to me an extraordinary thing for a court to hold that the prisoner clearly wanted to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.957" offset="4083231">He has alleged in all these papers that he wanted to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.206" offset="4096188">There has been no denial on the part of anybody that he wanted to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.124" offset="4127848">He was denied his right of appeal not on this basis of this motion because nobody had ever seen him but denied it only on the basis that even assuming he wanted his right of appeal and that it should be given to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.740" offset="4202350">He must show in addition to that a basis upon which an appeal might be successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.532" offset="4249475">In other words, in our Circuit, they have confused the constitutional rights provision under Section 2255 with the right of direct appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1243.925" offset="5079124">Well, in arranging it was this -- this forma pauperis business but he failed to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.336" offset="5112665">So I think we've got a clear case where the prisoner was improperly deprived of his right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.159" offset="5147982">The right is an absolute right that in the absence of prisoner knowledgeably waiving or giving up that right.</text>

            <text syncTime="1286.978" offset="5251323">There is every indication from the fact that the prisoner started within a six weeks, a few days after the 30 days went by.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.028" offset="5295522">He was writing out the first somewhat feeble attempt to get himself an appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1385.659" offset="5645981">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.541" offset="5653504">There really is a very narrow, almost no disagreement with between the petitioner and the Government in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.314" offset="5692583">The case is not quite clear and quite general throughout the Court that there are two situations which do call for some relief on that collateral remedy where a prisoner claims that he is been denied of right of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.851" offset="5750784">One is where his counsel has not told him anything about his rights of appeal and has abandoned him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.144" offset="5791953">And the other is, if counsel has been guilty of what courts sometimes called fraud but which if you look at the case, this amount to over reaching and it doesn't seem to be any conflict on proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.419" offset="5853080">That if a counsel assures a defendant that he will take care of his appeal and then deliberately does nothing, not just it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.098" offset="5907728">Besides that this is a basis for collateral relief with Ninth Circuit and possibly to other circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.737" offset="5946284">Although, their decisions are not wholly clear have been different where there has been a conflict is on the question of whether in addition to alleging a deprivation of right to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.804" offset="6010546">The prisoner has to show that it was some basis of appeal and the Ninth Circuit when its -- insisted on this requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.996" offset="6063313">We understand what there were trying to do which is try to shift the weak the good case and the bad one and we assume that if a man had a good point on appeal, it would tend to both to his contention that counsel deliberately didn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.154" offset="6143979">However on reflection, we have come to the conclusion that we can't support that as a requirement for requiring action in the District Court and the reason for that is that -- it seems to us not wholly continent with the real remedy that you're trying to get at.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.091" offset="6231751">What you -- what collateral relief was primarily, originally designed to do was to take care of the person who got caught in the coils of the law either the judge or the prosecution of his own Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.953" offset="6311163">And it seems to us that the -- those who are most likely to abuse the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.039" offset="6339480">That really kind of make up stories if we do encounter could meet the Ninth that a requirement with no difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.751" offset="6374379">But the truly honest, ignorant person who had been overreached by unscrupulous lawyer would find that the most difficult to specify whether there was legal error in his trial and for that reason, we do not urge the Ninth Circuit rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.077" offset="6467688">But since the case is here, we do think there are some things this Court could help clarify with respect to this kind of a claim or perhaps even more generally with respect to this question of, what does a judge do when he gets an allegation of this kind?</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.496" offset="6597360">I think no one who has had experience with them can feel to appreciate the fact that a lot of these are simply not true and the result wishful thinking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.112" offset="6655770">On the other hand, there are some that are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.664" offset="6674056">We have agreed that if what this petitioner alleges in his petition for a writ of certiorari which is must more detailed and much more specific then his allegations in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.764" offset="6750438">We have agreed that if -- what he alleges in a petition for certiorari, were alleged to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.733" offset="6790353">The District Court would have to do something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.047" offset="6811564">We find a little difficult to fool the District Court on that acting on what it had before it that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.156" offset="6843956">But even aside -- its true the District Court rested on the Ninth Circuit rule which were not defending but even on the petition in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.487" offset="6885334">It seems to us the petition is not specific enough as petition for certiorari is to require action and we think that's different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.228" offset="6932250">We think he have a right to require specific allegations in a District Court about what went on with his lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.615" offset="6969866">You can't expect an ignorant prisoner to know where there is legal error to track but he can know what went on with his lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.269" offset="7012498">Now in this -- in the petition, just -- he alleges something which is fairly consistent with what?</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.670" offset="7054085">Petitioner's counsel says, he has discovered ex parte.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.231" offset="7072266">He says, that he asked the Attorney to take an oral notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.425" offset="7097031">No, he has his Attorney to appeal and a petitioner's trial counsel gave oral notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.142" offset="7119914">I assumed he considered this rather cryptic motion to be an oral notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.558" offset="7145618">And then he says, petitioner's wife where then placed in a room to await transportation back to the county jail and that one of his other papers in the record, he said, he was held in the county jail for 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.098" offset="7203715">But at this point, he says, while they were waiting, petitioner's trial counsel came to take petitioner's wife and told them he would arrange for their cases to be appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.768" offset="7242480">Now that is a part that's -- we don't know what happened there, that's after this hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.496" offset="7273305">Whatever went on there and whether it is true or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.736" offset="7286366">I have no way of knowing but we agreed that if that allegation, that counsel said he would arranged all the cases to be appealed which appears only in petition for certiorari it made to the District Court would call for some action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.150" offset="7339969">But the question is what action?</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.996" offset="7351359">And I think that this is important not only in these situations which we hope full of rise rarely in view of the new rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.187" offset="7388139">But even more basically, generally in 2255 when you get allegations often made out of whole cloth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.483" offset="7437354">What is the judge do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.392" offset="7444982">And it seems to me that these -- this Court's decisions in both Walker against Johnston in 312 United States and in Machibroda have been misunderstood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.470" offset="7493256">In both of those cases, there were responsive affidavits filed and the Court held on the basis of those responsive affidavits where one side said “X” and the other side said exactly the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.078" offset="7571728">That the court could not decide the matter on affidavits that there had to be a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.367" offset="7592835">And I think there has been a tendency as to result to that to consider that affidavits had no part at all in a 2255 application.</text>

            <text syncTime="1893.445" offset="7677158">Although in both those cases, there were affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.440" offset="7693145">Now what the Court said is I revoke those cases is, these affidavits present a clear cut conflict of testimony and we have something as clear cut as that it has to be resolve to the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.955" offset="7747166">I presumed that if a lawyer in this case said, I did not arrange -- I did not tell the defendants, I would arrange for their appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.526" offset="7809442">And defendants said, he did -- there might be of necessity hearing except for what I am going to say next because I don't think that's enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.590" offset="7841729">It seems to me that the first thing you do in 2255 generally and certainly in this situation is to try to get the -- a responsive pleading in one from one to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.878" offset="7894915">Now, this Court just last Monday in the Harris case talked about flexibility of procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.029" offset="7923440">I don't think it has to be a formal responsive pleading like the old return in habeas corpus because that wouldn't be meaningful but what you do want is to get something in the form -- in the record which seems to me would most easily take the form of an affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.753" offset="7990418">Getting from in this case, the Attorney since the Government has no part of all these.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.770" offset="8010480">This was retained counsel and knew -- the Government obviously knew nothing that went on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.802" offset="8034617">Get from the Attorney a response.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.561" offset="8049664">Now, I can conceive of several responses which might settle the whole question one way or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.639" offset="8081951">For example, if the Attorney says, he did tell me he would like to appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2055.129" offset="8323845">I think experienced attorneys faced with charges are probably being careful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.400" offset="8352998">If they decide not to go ahead with appeal to get some sort of acknowledgement from counsel because counsel appointed and abused, and appointed as well as retained are subject to great many charges by precedent, very few of which proved to be justified.</text>

            <text syncTime="3656.721" offset="14730219">I think it's obvious in the situation of this kind that immediately on remand counsel must be appointed before the prisoner.</text>

            <text syncTime="3722.053" offset="14991548">To mean a defendant not represented by counsel during the 10-day period after which failure to file a notice of appeal would forever bar such a right.</text>
