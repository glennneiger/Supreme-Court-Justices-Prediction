            <text syncTime="14.056" offset="159640">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.013" offset="175417">First, it is important to show in this case that Lear never properly raised or preserved the question of whether licensee estoppel violates either the patent laws or the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.970" offset="231215">Although Mr. Wallace for the Government referred the Court to pages 25 to 28 of one of Lear's reply briefs where Lear had quoted the constitutional standard for invention and the sections of the patent laws dealing with validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.604" offset="309791">He did not read far enough from that portion of the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.519" offset="325465">In that section after quoting those provisions what Lear was arguing was only that the federal laws including the constitutional standard had to be applied in determining the question of validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.669" offset="382098">That portion did not in any way assert that the doctrine of licensee estoppel was invalid and that it violated either the patent laws or the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.029" offset="431522">In fact, at page 75 of that same brief, Lear had a separate section dealing with the doctrine of licensee estoppel in which Lear conceded that the doctrine was applicable in this case unless it fell within one of two exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.550" offset="513546">One being termination and the other being repudiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.931" offset="531101">I have Xerox copies of the brief that Mr. Wallace referred to pages 18 to 26 and I have handed them to the Clerk this morning for this Court to consider if it's so desires.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.298" offset="592541">Now, I offer now a copy to the Government.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter R. Cohen</label>
            <text syncTime="125.687" offset="606124">It's 18 through 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.704" offset="646144">In fact, the Government concedes in its amicus brief that the issue of whether or not the doctrine of licensee estoppel violates either the patent laws or the antitrust laws was not timely raised or preserved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.386" offset="708942">At page 8, the Government says as follows, “This Court need not be deterred from reaching this issue, licensee estoppel by the fact that petitioner's contentions in the state courts were directed primarily to attempting to carve out an exception to the doctrine rather than to its overturn.”</text>
            <text syncTime="173.369" offset="796818">Because of this Court's decision upholding the doctrine at Automatic Radio Co. versus Hazeltine it would have been futile for the petitioner to argue broadly to the state courts that federal law bars the states from applying the doctrine of patent licensee estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.652" offset="885948">Moreover, Lear has conceded in the state court system that the rule of licensee estoppel was applicable unless Lear fell within one of two state exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.783" offset="934536">The best statement of this concession appears at page 109 of Lear's answering brief in the California District Court which is quoted at page 120 of the appendix before this Court and which states as follows, “it is a recognized principle of law that when a license agreement provides a grant of a right to either manufacture, use or sell a product incorporating a patented invention, the licensee is estopped to contest the validity of the license patent only so long as the licensee is operating under the license.”</text>
            <text syncTime="252.534" offset="1113527">This is not only the modern rule as plaintiff likes to call it but as also the old rule as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.033" offset="1143515">This rule was set out in the 1939 case of the Armstrong Co. versus the Shell Company of California which was a California Court opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.071" offset="1183640">Lear then goes on to say this estoppel as only so long as the licensee operates under the license agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.324" offset="1216658">This estoppel arises not because of the expressed terms in the agreement but because the licensee is using and enjoying the benefit and protection of the right covered by the agreement and should not be permitted to reap the benefits of the agreement and at the same time contest the validity of the patents to show failure of consideration for the agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="906.209" offset="3728175">Fourth, the California Supreme Court did not consider the issue of validity and under settled procedural rules of this Court will not normally pass on questions in the first instance without the lower courts having first undertaking to decide those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.375" offset="3808841">In fact, the Government urges at page 26 of its amicus brief that if the issue of validity must to be reached that the case should be remanded to the California Supreme Court for consideration of this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.817" offset="3874670">Consequently, in my view because the doctrine of licensee estoppel was never properly raised as a federal issue and the doctrine of the validity of a patent is consequently not before the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1203.643" offset="4917896">Now, those conditions subsequent were, one, if no patent issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.640" offset="4945899">Two, if a patent issue with claims which did not cover the inventions they were using in the 2156 California gyro and the Michigan steel gyros.</text>

            <text syncTime="1520.868" offset="6186820">And the Court there said, “The sale or a lease of unpatented machines on long-term payments based on a deferred purchase price or on use would present wholly different considerations.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2491.000" offset="10067362">The validity of the patent was adverted to in the agreement only in connection with the right to terminate if the patent “was subsequently held invalid.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2710.819" offset="10946644">It arose rather with an agreement dated December 29, 1951 between Adkins and Lear which is one page in length as copied verbatim at page 11 of the appendix in which Adkins agreed to disclose the Lear “all ideas inventions and discoveries which he might conceive of which Lear agreed expressly would be Adkins property and Adkins then agreed to license it to Lear for a mutually satisfactory royalty.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.509" offset="11085406">This agreement made no mention of patents, patent rights or patentability to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.335" offset="11112678">The existence of a patent or patent right under this agreement was totally irrelevant then pursuant to that agreement Adkins went to work for Lear and did invent something which they wanted and when it look to Lear like it was going to be commercially successful they said to themselves, well, we have to do something about this first agreement because under state law he will collect that reasonable royalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="2965.055" offset="11963643">Well, that would cut pretty far one because practically every patent license agreement involves the same kind of -- involves a licensee of know-how and I suppose there are great many that involved facts somewhat like this in terms of the background of the patent license agreement itself which you really -- it's possible that the argument is that an invitation to this Court to supersede some aspect that at least the federal patent law where the parties had a relationship of employer or employee during the period of invention.</text>

            <text syncTime="3078.582" offset="12417651">The 55, yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.639" offset="12425906">First, Lear received the exclusive uncontested and immediate right to use the secret idea discovering invention which Adkins had disclosed until final patent office action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.711" offset="12478255">Note, that I say exclusive and not nonexclusive because the license agreement was in fact expressly exclusive contrary to what the Solicitor General states in his brief, it started out as an exclusive license not a nonexclusive license.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.836" offset="12542725">Second, Lear received the cancellation of the letter agreement that December 29, 1951 under which his liability to Adkins was far broader than under the agreement that replaced it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.181" offset="12596120">Under that agreement pursuant to California law, particularly a case known as Desny versus Wilder which is California Supreme Court case cited in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.999" offset="12635408">Based on that agreement, the Court would find that there was an implied contract between the parties for Lear to take the mutually satisfactory royalty which it would have determined was a reasonable royalty and under that agreement, Lear would be bound to pay as long as Lear use the device without any escape hatches or condition subsequent termination clauses whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.919" offset="12739062">And that brings to the third point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.010" offset="12747421">Third thing that Lear got under this agreement was the right to seize payment of “for the royalties” if no patent issued or if it issue which claims which did not cover the gyros in issue or some third party held it invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.447" offset="12821191">And fourth and equally important, there were two additional agreements signed concurrently with this license agreement which are attached to Lear's answer and are on appendix A at pages 40 to 45 wherein Lear in addition to receiving the right to use the invention disclosed in the patent application also received a release from Adkins of all other and different ideas, discoveries and invention which he may have created for the year past, present and future as long as he work for the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.661" offset="12982000">So that this was the consideration that Lear was concerned for and was bargaining for as the California Supreme Court recognized it was not bargaining in addition for a conclusively valid patent under which it could say that the patent was invalid and therefore we don't have to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.681" offset="13050128">Its sole rights were under the very carefully drawn condition subsequent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.704" offset="13114180">I think it's also important in this case to understand that when Adkins went to work for Lear in January of 1952 after signing this first letter agreement, he went to work for what the president of Lear Incorporated described his “coffee and cake money” which was $650.00 a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.478" offset="13201324">Thus, Adkins real reward under this initial bargain was to be dependent upon his successors and inventor and after spending approximately six months experimenting with a bearing on as a self-aligning type bearing he concluded that that approach to the problem would not work after which he conceived of the invention which is the subject matter of this case and fully disclosed it to Lear both to its executive personnel, to its technical personnel in Grand Rapids both in writing and orally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.148" offset="13359940">Now, after Adkins made this disclosure, Lear at its Michigan plant in Grand Rapids began experimenting also with a self-aligning principle which Adkins had rejected and experimented with this principle for roughly 13 months at which time they were intending to put the self-aligning principle into what we're now calling the Michigan Steel gyros.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.870" offset="13482820">In fact, they had set up on production ready to go with the self-aligning principle in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.769" offset="13506435">And after a limited production run, it was determined that it would not work in production quantity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.224" offset="13536319">As a result of which, the technical personnel at Michigan held what Mr. Shepple who was the head of that section referred to as a midnight meeting and decided to use Adkins' invention in the steel gyros as the only solution to the problem at a critical time period when they had to get it to production with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.636" offset="13617925">The result was that between 1955 and 1963, Lear amassed sales in excess of $67 million effectively eliminating all competition in this market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.856" offset="13674768">Now, all that we're asking here is that the Court recognizes that the California Supreme Court did that the primary consideration for the bargain had nothing to do with the validity of the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.746" offset="13726386">It was solely the right to use this valuable invention and the other additional considerations which I have outlined subject to Lear's rights to terminate on these conditions subsequent which we're very carefully drawn to provide that they would not be as broad as Lear as now urging and the California Supreme Court in fact found they were not as broad.</text>

            <text syncTime="3804.308" offset="15320586">The function is the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="3808.688" offset="15338141">There is no material difference whatsoever in these gyros.</text>
            <text syncTime="3813.196" offset="15356113">In both gyros, the assembly procedures as follows: bearing cups are placed on the ends of the mandrel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3821.581" offset="15389654">The cups are held on the mandrel not by screws as Mr. Hale may have implied but rather are held on the mandrel by the tight fit of the bearing cup with respect to the mandrel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.018" offset="15447437">Then, the bearing cups are coated with cement and the two gimbal halves are placed over the mandrel holding the bearing cups.</text>
            <text syncTime="3845.739" offset="15486307">Each gimbal half has a center hole and when it is closed down on this mandrel the bearing cups position themselves in the hole where when the cement dries the bearing cups are then left in the relationship which they were in on the mandrel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3867.166" offset="15571989">Once, the cement dries it's taken apart, the mandrel is removed and the screws which hold the gimbal to the mandrel are also removed and formed no part of the invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3878.939" offset="15619114">So, that the result in structure is a structure consisting of a pair of three elements which achieves coaxial and parallel alignment without relationship to the parallelism of the end bells or the coaxial alignment of the receiving holes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3896.797" offset="15690585">That, I suppose is an over simplification but that's the essence of this invention and that was used in both the 2156 California gyro and also in the Michigan steel gyros in the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3915.896" offset="15766967">In fact, as Mr. Shepple who I have referred to before stated and he was the head of the steel gyro development program the assembly finished structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3926.550" offset="15809599">The result are the same in both gyros and the principle is the same in both gyros.</text>
            <text syncTime="3933.230" offset="15836244">Thus, the remaining question is whether claim 9 which was on a chart presented by Mr. Hale yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3941.262" offset="15868426">Question is whether that claim covers these gyros.</text>
            <text syncTime="3944.568" offset="15881592">Lear concedes that it covers the 2156 gyros and because there are no material differences between the 2156 California gyro and the Michigan steel gyros it also covers the Michigan steel gyros.</text>
            <text syncTime="3960.976" offset="15947316">This is what the jury found and this is also what the California Supreme Court held stating in fact that the evidence was uncontradicted that claim 9 covers the Michigan steel gyros.</text>

            <text syncTime="4497.952" offset="18095208">But to the sole extent that Lear's rights to terminate and avoid its bargain are tied to the -- what the patent office would do what some third party might do, did not give Lear the right to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4512.616" offset="18153827">In other words, it is tied in a limited way to what might happen under the patent laws but only in a very limited way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4520.015" offset="18183398">It doesn't form a part of the consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4522.622" offset="18193847">It forms only the conditions subsequent under which Lear can get out of the bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="4531.894" offset="18230941">Now, assuming the sake of argument only that the doctrine of licensee estoppel has to be overturned then the question becomes what happens to this case thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4545.764" offset="18286425">Now, although Lear urges that this Court then delve into the issues of validity of the patent and itself determine the issue, the Government concedes that in that situation the case should be remanded to the California Supreme Court which has not yet considered the issue of validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4568.176" offset="18376077">It is the policy of this Court that lower courts first be given the opportunity to pass on questions before this Court reviews them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4576.711" offset="18410245">Otherwise, in this case, the result would be since there are no new or noble patent issues involved but this Court would be sitting and performing a function performed by the Court of Claims for instance that, the right of ordinary review rather than reviewing questions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4598.091" offset="18495718">Moreover, even if the patent was held invalid that would not in the case, that would still be additional things that have to be considered such as the proper cut-off date for the payment of royalties if the patent is held invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="4613.977" offset="18559248">And on this issue, the Government also concedes in its amicus brief that the resolution of this issue where the license is exclusive would depend upon state considerations of fairness between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4632.353" offset="18632808">Similarly, we would have in this case the right to pursue the second cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4639.501" offset="18661334">The second cause of action was an alternative cause of action which existed for the idea, discovery and invention as and unpatented and unpatentable invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="4653.479" offset="18717236">And we took the position under that second cause of action that if the license agreement for some reason failed either because of a failure or consideration or because of some illegality or for some other reason that Adkins was under one of these theories pleaded there entitled to recover the reasonable value of what he in fact convey to Lear when he disclosed the idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="4679.654" offset="18822040">Now, although it's been contended that Mr. Adkins waived the second cause of action in its entirety he did not in fact do so of the trial court had held that Mr. Adkins have waived the entire cause of action but on the writ of mandate proceeding, the District Court of Appeal reversed and compelled the trial court judge to enter an amendment to the judgment stating that the second cause of action had not been waived for what Adkins had disclosed to Lear insofar as related to the subject matter of the patent application.</text>
