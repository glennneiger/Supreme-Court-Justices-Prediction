            <text syncTime="15.186" offset="164133">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.623" offset="169880">Your Honors, at the conclusion remarks yesterday, counsel had mentioned that the Iowa State Penitentiary of Fort Madison had prior to my client's trial become the focus of investigation by the prosecuting attorney's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.592" offset="225782">He had interviewed prisoners there but what they might know about Mr. Johnson, what they have been able to find out and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.903" offset="259009">Two prisoners ultimately came up with a report admissions made by Mr. Johnson to this offense, oral admissions as well as notes which were introduced at the trial at State's Exhibits number 1 and 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.436" offset="325151">These notes sought to portray the prisoner in this case is a man seeking to cook up an alibi to the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.694" offset="362141">The prisoner said that they got the notes when my client was trying to smuggle them outside the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.177" offset="392129">Now, these notes were also validated at trial by a handwriting expert called by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.036" offset="415535">This handwriting expert said that Mr. Johnson who was required to print this card, handwriting exemplar card was the same hand who had printed the two notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.962" offset="459212">Now, on later years Your Honor, Mr. Johnson in about 1960 was able to send these three exhibits to a handwriting expert who was a leading authority in this country on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.335" offset="500694">This man made a detailed examination of the handwriting on the exemplar card detailed analysis of that appearing on the two notes and he concluded that the original trial testimony was completely wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.383" offset="548864">That the notes were not written by Mr. Johnson, that they were in fact apparently forged notes.</text>

            <text syncTime="543.804" offset="2278588">In addition to the burdens of the suppressed witness and what we contend is false evidence, our petitioner here was required, Your Honors, to bear one further burden and that was the burden of proof on a lead issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.012" offset="2343372">The issue of whether the prisoner was at Burlington, Iowa or in Des Moines, 165 miles away at the time of the offense in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.679" offset="2382137">Now, he presented here a very strong alibi defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.287" offset="2396557">He called the owner of a gas station who had filled his tank in Des Moines that morning about the time the homicide occurred, 165 miles away.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.431" offset="2437099">He traded there for about a year and this appears to be an independent witness, no particular acts to (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="589.674" offset="2462072">But later that morning, the owner of the cigar counter said, “Mr. Johnson was in.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.404" offset="2480985">His father was here and bought a cigar.”</text>
            <text syncTime="596.678" offset="2490075">I'm not asking the Court here to retry these facts but I'm simply raising the point that a strong alibi defense was presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.890" offset="2522885">Several witnesses, many of them independent placed my client in the City of Des Moines at a point where it would have been impossible for him to have committed this murder if they were believed.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.885" offset="2566875">Now, the trial court because we had gone ahead and called witnesses on this point of alibi, instructed the jury that in order to prevail on none presence at the scene, the defendant was required to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he was elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.910" offset="2650990">As Mr. Justice Brennan pointed out in Speiser versus Randall, the burden of proof may well be determinative in a given case and for that reason, we suggest that this instruction given by the trial court as well as the references by the prosecuting attorney which appear on page 113 and 114 of our record were highly detrimental to our prisoner's presumption of innocence in his fair trial rights in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.343" offset="2764779">It is up to the defense, the prosecutor said, the burden of proof of alibi and they have to prove that.</text>

            <text syncTime="674.784" offset="2802500">Again, the prosecutor said, “Are you going to accept the alibi of pool-hall hangers-on and friend of Johnson and his relation when the man himself has never denied it under oath?”</text>
            <text syncTime="685.597" offset="2845759">Certainly, he tells the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.000" offset="2851401">“Certainly, you are entitled to know what he has to say and remember the burden of proof of alibi rests on the defense, and they have to meet that burden.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2059.148" offset="8339937">First of all, the falsity of the notes is still simply a matter of opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2076.442" offset="8409109">It was before the jury that perhaps they were forged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.172" offset="8424051">A Mr. Yates, a defense witness got up and gave very clear testimony that he did not think the petitioner had written the notes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2104.677" offset="8522062">So, we believe that the jury was completely aware of the circumstances surrounding these notes that it was a jury determination to be made then and the jury's decision we are sure even if there had been the expert testimony available today would have been relatively the same as was then.</text>

            <text syncTime="2713.699" offset="10958137">Thank you Your Honor, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.540" offset="10969527">Your Honor, the age of the petitioner as Mr. Justice Black asked is presently 63 years old and I understand he was 29 when he entered the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.720" offset="11022294">Mr. Justice Marshall has suggested that the effective Orsucci on the jury is absolutely incalculable at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.637" offset="11053955">I think that's true and had our right to have him secured as a witness at the trial then vouchsafed to is, Your Honor, that there would be no problem on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.840" offset="11090735">It is in fact the responsibility of the state that this was not done and we suggest there responsibility in years since.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.898" offset="11122918">Well, prior to the time that Mr. Orsucci died that we were denied a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.239" offset="11140368">Their steady resistances to our applications for hearing are off record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.528" offset="11157504">In 1961, we appeared in the District Court in the Southern District of Iowa, raised this point, raised the point of the false notes and again we were denied without hearing, again this was resisted by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.674" offset="11214033">Now, the witness dies in 1965, the respondent says, well, you didn't preserve his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.994" offset="11239320">I suggest that we had disabilities in preserving that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.194" offset="11252172">We did try to take an affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.678" offset="11262098">Your Honor, I have looked at that California deposition and in connection with the colloquy on that point, the Federal District Court at the time he ordered this California deposition made clear that he was doing it only because the witness there, the deponent was out of state, was of old age and there was a possibility his testimony might be lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.413" offset="11365021">Now in connection with the notes, the point has been made here that the notes did occupy a very substantial place in this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.179" offset="11396054">Now, the trial record shows that over 40 pages of transcript were dedicated on the part of state evidence to these notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.771" offset="11426461">In addition, we urged to the Court that there were exhibits 1 and 2 at the original trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2841.085" offset="11467734">Mr. Claerhout suggests that because we were able to put on the stand a prisoner from the state penitentiary who said, “Mr. Prosecutor, those notes were fictitious, you knew it and I knew it and I told you that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.608" offset="11517785">That somehow now we had destroyed their effect on the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.371" offset="11528861">This overlooks the fact that we were not able to generate expert testimony at that time and the state's case on this point was much more persuasive at the time of this original trial.</text>
