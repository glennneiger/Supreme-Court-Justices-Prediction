            <label>Mr. Richard J. Maclaury</label>
            <text syncTime="24.616" offset="201853">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.545" offset="217527">My pan of argument is to spend 25 minutes on the opening and then reserve for if the Court please, five minutes for rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.460" offset="257233">This case comes here from the District Court, in the District of Arizona on direct appeal under the Expediting Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.457" offset="293177">It tests for the first time the validity under the antitrust laws of a newspaper operating agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.328" offset="328704">The agreement combines the commercial asset and the functions of two newspapers in Tucson, Arizona, the morning, in Sunday Star and the evening, Citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.724" offset="394219">Agreements of this kind have become increasingly necessary to preserve competition between newspapers on the journalistic level.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.947" offset="439150">The reason the agreement was adopted is because Tucson cannot support two newspapers operating at both the journalistic and the commercial levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.702" offset="498186">Now, this situation is not peculiar to Tucson.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.531" offset="517517">Over the past 30 or 40 years, there has been a drastic decline in the number of separately owned newspapers in the same city.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.144" offset="555969">In 1920, there were 552 cities having separately owned newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.657" offset="585958">20 years later in 1940, there were only 181 and by the mid-sixties, there were 65.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.472" offset="629217">And of the 65, more than one third operated under agreements such as we have into consideration here.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.409" offset="669027">Now the Government claims that this agreement is a per se violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act and the District Court on summary judgment held that it was in fact a violation, a per se violation of Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.427" offset="733080">It is our contention that the agreement in substance and effect was a merger and that the Court should've judged it under the rule of reason and specifically that it should apply to this agreement the failing company doctrine because Citizen in 1940 was truly in a failing condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.209" offset="820224">Now, we do not seek here to justify per se violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.687" offset="842167">The Government argued below and it argues in its brief here that all we do is to seek to justify per se violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.952" offset="883231">I just like to emphasize to the Court that that is not our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.879" offset="902875">We feel that the agreement is entirely lawful and would've been found lawful had it been examined under the rule of reason rather than on summary judgment and under the per se rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.190" offset="968182">This case involves a typical situation of the economic conditions experienced by newspapers throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.655" offset="1002036">In 1940, Citizen was in fact a failing company.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.695" offset="1022203">It did not pay dividends for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.699" offset="1038190">Its liabilities far exceeded its assets and it have been kept alive in able to pay its current bills only by contributions from its stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.424" offset="1097017">In contrast its competitor, the Morning Star was in good financial condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.081" offset="1127737">It was a strong competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.991" offset="1135365">It was selling more than 50% -- it sold more than 50% of the advertising in Tucson.</text>

            <text syncTime="269.936" offset="1183117">The respect to circulations in 1939 were approximately 2000 a part.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.085" offset="1215718">Sun -- the daily circulation, the Sun -- the Star was approximately 12,000, the Citizen approximately, 10,000, but in addition, Star had a 12,000 circulation of its Sunday edition which Citizen did not have.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.891" offset="1286980">Those figures are approximation but there has always been from 1932 on through 1939, a variation of 1500 to 1800 up to 2000 difference in its circulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.874" offset="1358869">Now, as I say in contrast Star was making a profit and sold 50% more advertising than Citizen and in the --</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard J. Maclaury</label>
            <text syncTime="339.659" offset="1462000">Well, I think it was due in large measure to the Sunday edition but not entirely, Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.580" offset="1493661">There was of course available to the Star the combination of rate between Sunday and Monday and Saturday and Sunday and Sunday being the unattractive advertising day.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.234" offset="1540263">It did give Star an advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.986" offset="1555310">Now, in these circumstances, Citizen had several choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.890" offset="1590941">It could've ceased publication and shut down its operations and sold equipment on the secondhand market.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.070" offset="1627617">Or it could've sold out or merged with Star.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.376" offset="1664920">The evidence was undisputed that Citizen in that failing condition could not have been sold to an outside competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.372" offset="1700864">Of course no outside competitor would've wanted to come in and place itself in the shoes of a failing company against an established newspaper such as Star.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.116" offset="1751855">Now it took neither of these courses but instead took the third course and that was to enter into an operating agreement with Star which preserved for the citizens of Tucson and for these newspapers, two separate rival, competing editorial voices.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.404" offset="1837014">And it's our contention here that that was a far, far more preferable choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.298" offset="1860524">A far more preferable course of conduct than to have merged entirely and shutdown this competing voice of Citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.216" offset="1900231">And so they entered into this operating agreement which was premised on the basic economic back in the newspaper business that newspapers operate in two levels as we all know, at the journalistic-editorial level and also at a commercial level.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.498" offset="1969403">By commercial I mean, running mechanical equipment, the press, the composing room, of the pricing and sale of advertising and the circulation and establishment of circulation prices and the general business affairs of the two newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.502" offset="2037426">That is what I refer to as the commercial level.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.655" offset="2049964">So the newspapers operate at both these levels, the operating agreement recognized that and provided for what we referred to as in substance and effect a merger of the commercial assets -- of the assets devoted for the commercial functions as well as the personnel, records and all of the material devoted in use at the commercial level of these two businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.912" offset="2163022">But on the other hand, the separate identities of Star and Citizen will retain and the provision in the agreement specify that Star and Citizen would continue to be published separately and the court find -- found that ever since the agreement indeed, Star and Citizen have continued in rival composition of news and editorial materials and have developed into two high quality newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.895" offset="2314951">The agreement was patterned after to what we refer to as the Albuquerque agreement which was then in effect and is still in effect, stopped at 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.843" offset="2358732">The purpose of the operating agreement was to merge these commercial functions and assets so to support two separate news and editorial voices.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.174" offset="2408051">To do this, the parties didn't really see three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.884" offset="2426859">First, each newspaper acquired in joint interest in the assets of the other newspaper necessary to produce newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.607" offset="2469804">Secondly, they organized a third corporation which was called Tucson Newspaper Inc., we refer to it as TNI.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.615" offset="2505853">And thirdly, TNI then fickle with a management and control of these assets, they operated the press room, the composing room, and other mechanical equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.214" offset="2560188">They sold advertising space in both newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.290" offset="2576488">They established advertising rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.676" offset="2586102">They circulated the newspapers, operated the distribution trucks and established the circulation rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.309" offset="2624658">Star and Citizen each own equal shares in it's -- in the third corporation TNI and the board of directors of TNI or by the number, three appointed by Star, substance and two by Citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.301" offset="2704593">But the management of TNI was completely separate from the management of the editors and the publishing people of the two newspapers, it was a separate management, they had a separate general manager, a separate comptroller, separate man who headed the advertising department, had nothing to do with the editorial levels of the two newspapers of the separate operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.263" offset="2820472">We are urged -- the District Court because that this was a -- in effect, substance in effect a merger or a consolidation to judge the agreement under the rule or reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.412" offset="2892988">But this it refused to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.575" offset="2905631">It was the District Court's view that the failing company doctrine would've applied in this situation if Star had acquired Citizen outright and published both newspapers as a single owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.374" offset="2968848">As the -- the court ruled in effect that the transaction would not have been unlawful if the newspapers had gone further than they did and eliminated all news and editorial rivalry.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.982" offset="3043349">Now, we do not urge that the fact that this case deals with newspapers exempts the activity -- trust laws but we do urge that the District Court interpret the Sherman -- the elimination of a separate and effective editorial voice -- that there was a separate voice.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.819" offset="3150660">That they were competing editorial voices in Tucson should have been a factor that the court should've taken under consideration in deciding whether or not this agreement was unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.933" offset="3211055">It was the benefit to the community, arriving from separate editorial voices is a factor that the court should've taken into consideration but on the con --</text>

            <text syncTime="1590.880" offset="6466853">In their agreement to reduce costs and in four on the same page they speak of what they did in furtherance of their intent to eliminate competition between the two papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.552" offset="6517530">Moreover, both of the parties conceded at the trial that this was the purpose of the operating agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.444" offset="6549191">Mr. Matthews who was the owner of the Star stated that was the purpose of the agreement to end commercial competition between Star and Citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.587" offset="6585762">This is at page 194 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.895" offset="6598928">Mr. Small Sr. would then who was the owner of the Citizen said the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.000" offset="6627349">A Mr. Chambers who had been the business and edit and advertising manager of the Star in 1940 and who had participated in the negotiations leading to the joint operating agreement, he stated at page 155 of the record when he was asked as the -- whether as the result of this Tucson Newspapers, Inc. was there any competition remaining between the Star with respect to the business aspect, he said, "We tried to make it not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.204" offset="6752214">I don't think that there was."</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.471" offset="6761305">And then he later -- a few pages later at page 158 of the record he was asked whether this arrangement could've worked if the revenues had been divided on some method other than a fixed formula which I will come to in a minute and he said, "No."</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.470" offset="6817207">He didn't think it would.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.316" offset="6820655">He said that that was -- would've defeated all the idea we had for accomplishing this unification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.071" offset="6843643">We were trying, he said, "I guess that competition is a nasty word in this Court but we were trying to eliminate the competition between the two of us."</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.226" offset="6880319">That's all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.507" offset="6885439">Now, in addition to this testimony at the trial we had in this record a rather unusual document which is Government exhibit number 26 which was a submission that the Star made in 1947 to the Internal Revenue Service in support of excess profits tax relief for the more years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.124" offset="6975822">And I have to read to the court a couple of the things that the Star said in this document about the purpose of the 1940 agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.466" offset="7005288">In page 409 they said, it is obvious that the aim and purpose of the parties was to destroy every vestige of the competition that existed on January 1, 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.543" offset="7057533">Then at pages 420 and 421 they say in order to preserve perpetual elimination of competition the operate agreements provides that neither of these papers will engage in publication of any other newspaper in Tucson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.618" offset="7117824">On the next page in rather large type at the bottom of the page, they told what the purpose was and they said, "And this two paper -- the Arizona Star did in large letters underlined did eliminate all competition from the local newspaper field on that day."</text>

            <text syncTime="1857.972" offset="7535261">Now how did they set about -- how did they accomplish this elimination of competition?</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.993" offset="7555323">They did it basically from three aspects of the joint operating agreement and I want to make it clear that the Government is not challenging the joint operating agreement as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.080" offset="7595656">It is only challenging this three aspects and the District Court has not struck down the operating agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.224" offset="7624286">It has only struck out these three paragraphs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.828" offset="7638706">The first thing they did was they turned over to this Tucson Newspapers, Incorporated which they jointly control the sole authority to fix prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.779" offset="7678516">That is to fix the advertising rates, to fix the circulation rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.963" offset="7695235">Neither of them after this agreement could fix their own advertising or circulation rates independently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.689" offset="7726164">Now I would like to suggest to the Court a hypothetical situation because I think it illustrates the basic argument they are making here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.432" offset="7761063">Let us assume we had two newspapers in town and both of them were losing money and the publishers of the papers got together and said, things are terrible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.456" offset="7797217">We're both losing money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.249" offset="7804322">The best solution to this problem is for both of us substantially to increase our rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.786" offset="7822503">And they shook hands on it and they said, "Fine, we'll do this the first of next month."</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.898" offset="7842983">And then they decided themselves what the rate level would be and they said, "Well, let's turn it over to a third person to fix the rate."</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.983" offset="7867329">It seems to me two things are clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.113" offset="7875793">First, that they could not possibly offer any defense to this as a per se violation, it's clearly per se and secondly, they could not attempt to justify this type of arrangement on the plea that this was necessary to preserve the companies.</text>

            <text syncTime="2066.311" offset="8368567">Now, this seems to us has a very obvious effect, a very obvious effect of deterring the incentive of each paper to take whatever steps might increase its circulation because obviously if one paper decided to try to increase its circulation, a large part of that immediately flows over to the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="2840.204" offset="11464182">First of all, the initial overtures about making this arrangement came not from the Citizen which allegedly was the failing company but from the other paper, from the Star.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.760" offset="11510366">Now this is directly in contrast with the International Shoe case where the overtures came from the failing company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.047" offset="11535548">It seems to us, this is of some significance cause normally if a company feels that it can't go on it would take the initiative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.043" offset="11563551">Now in the International Shoe case, this Court found that the controlling purpose of International in acquiring the McElwain Company, the failing company there was to get additional plans for its business which it could not have been quickly hope to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.665" offset="11642023">And in its discussion of what it was holding as to that, the acquisition of the company in those circumstances would not violate Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.665" offset="11678072">It put in as a qualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.224" offset="11688312">The -- in the passage which the appellants themselves quote in their brief at page 41 that the purchase of the competitor there was not and I ?not with a purpose to lessen competition.?</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.284" offset="11740557">And that of course is exactly the opposite of the purpose the District Court found was involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.509" offset="11769396">Now, initially in 1936, a small purchase, only a 25% interest in the paper, over the next three years, he increased his share of the paper from 25 to 75%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.023" offset="11823417">It's been suggested that he made attempts to finance the paper and they were unsuccessful in this interval.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.682" offset="11850062">The record shows at pages 205 to 206 that these attempts, he merely spoke to three people he knew, a retired man, a man who just moved to Arizona and asked him, wouldn't he perhaps like to put some money into the paper and they refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.068" offset="11907636">When those three people refused to do so, Mr. Small decided to move to Tucson from Chicago and what he said -- what the District Court found when he testified was, he said -- he decided to come out himself at page 206 of the record, he said, "I felt that I could carry the deficit from some little time."</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.465" offset="11993213">There's nothing to indicate at, that when this operating agreement was entered into that Mr. Small had any intention of liquidating the Citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.176" offset="12032084">That there's no indication he tried any steps to improve its financial condition and there's nothing to show he made any efforts to try to sell it to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.848" offset="12074715">Now as to the financial condition of the paper, it is true, the Citizen for a number of years had been losing money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.226" offset="12104286">However, between 1938 and 1939 just before the time that Mr. Small came out or during this period, the paper's condition improved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.440" offset="12153083">Its circulation in those -- between those two years went up 22%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.827" offset="12170637">Its deficit was reduced.Its advertising had gone up and its operating revenues had gone up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.116" offset="12195819">Now the appellants tried us and say we've made an unfair comparison because they say 1938 was the worst year of the Citizen and we shouldn't compare it with 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.978" offset="12235316">But of course it seems not unlikely perhaps that this was the turning in the Citizen of course and this was the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.721" offset="12262275">This was the situation that the Citizen was faced with when it decided to enter into this operating agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.834" offset="12290696">It saw -- this was -- it was at this point that Mr. Small when these improvements seem to be developing that he decided to come out to Tucson to play a more active role in the paper and he said to carry it along for a little while.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.019" offset="12339493">And finally -- oh, one other thing, I might mention, that on the -- there have been a reference to the balance sheet, that a substantial portion of these liabilities as Mr. MacLaury has indicated belongs to stockholders and finally, as to the present condition, as to the present, the claim is a pro forma earning statement in which we point out what we think there's some deficiencies on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.748" offset="12438340">But it seems to us, the answer to all of this argument that the Citizen was equally certain to fail again if it was now required to terminate this profit pooling, price fixing and division of market, provisions of the agreement is the District Court's three findings at page 98 to 99, findings number 190 to 192 which says that the joint trading and distribution of the Star does not depend upon these provisions that the restoration of competition requires that they have separate advertising and circulation requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.352" offset="12600822">And finally, finding 192, the court says, "It is impossible to predict with any substantial degree of completeness what the operating results of either newspaper will be in a competitive situation."</text>
