            <text syncTime="69.669" offset="383122">Thereafter, in August of 1965, there was a burglary of a coin shop, the Money Vault.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.136" offset="424918">This took place in Orange, California nearby.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.886" offset="439965">Without going into a great deal of detail, there was suspicion of the petitioner as to the Pulati burglary but I think it was pretty much agreed and appears in the record, that way, that there was no probable cause on which his arrest could have been founded.</text>

            <text syncTime="119.489" offset="582384">Also prior to that time, he had talked to them about insurance whether or not the coins were insured.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.543" offset="606521">He knew, of course, as a fellow member of coin clubs that they were coin collectors and that they did have coins in their home.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.757" offset="647377">As to the Money Vault burglary, the petitioner made a statement before the burglary to a neighbor that he had a big deal cooking that night and that he was going to knock over.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.951" offset="716236">I don't know whether he said coin shop exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.034" offset="724490">He was going to knock over a place, anyhow.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.600" offset="734835">Thereafter, to the same neighbor he made a statement the day following the burglary that an attempt had been made to enter, which had been unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.673" offset="779139">And some two weeks later he made another statement to another coin shop operator that he had been involved in the Money Vault matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.739" offset="839325">Now, then, this was about the middle of August.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.482" offset="866283">On August 25th, the California Supreme Court found that petitioner was arrested without a warrant, on the street, in Santa Ana, California, by the investigating officer here, Officer Del Coma.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.126" offset="936918">After transportation to the Orange Police Station and some interrogation, petitioner was released.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.335" offset="977774">Then on September 13th, something more than two weeks later, Officer Del Coma went to the appropriate magistrate and submitted a complaint in purely conclusionary form.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.885" offset="1043916">The complaint is set out in the petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.191" offset="1065127">On the basis of this complaint which, in substance, merely said, “I believe that this man committed a burglary on such and such a date in this county”; on the basis of this complaint, a warrant of arrest issued at 10:39 a.m. on September 13th.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.587" offset="1158750">Officer Del Coma doesn't give us too clear a picture of what he did the rest of that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.980" offset="1180275">He knew where the petitioner was at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.284" offset="1189575">He knew where he worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.206" offset="1193232">He knew where to go and get him.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.306" offset="1201591">But in any case, Officer Del Coma arrived at the petitioner's home something shortly after 4:00 p.m., knowing at that time that he was not home.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.897" offset="1256030">He gained admittance to the house, waited for him to come home.</text>

            <text syncTime="326.341" offset="1409735">We don't contend that the officer's presence was unlawful at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.548" offset="1438574">Mr. Chimel came home at something like 4:30 p.m., whereupon the officer, after he had entered the house, placed him under arrest on the authority of the warrant, showed him the warrant, requested permission to search, which was not granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.108" offset="1500850">The officer then stated that, having executed a lawful arrest on a felony warrant, he had a right to search, and he was going to, and proceeded to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.494" offset="1550378">This search covered every room in the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.331" offset="1569708">It covered the garage.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.839" offset="1575769">It covered an inspection in the attic and it involved the opening of drawers, the opening of boxes, cupboards.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.870" offset="1623834">It was described by the officer as a general search.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.814" offset="1647658">The officer did not have knowledge, at the time he made this search of any -- of information which led him to believe that any specific property was to be found in that house.</text>

            <text syncTime="1312.939" offset="5356105">I'm not really suggesting this, because I think Trupiano was a very difficult case on its own facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.724" offset="5391318">Trupiano, it may be recalled, involved a valid arrest of Antonio, who was then committing a felony, and the still, the paraphernalia for committing the felony was in plain view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.028" offset="5448474">I think possibly Trupiano went too far in not permitting the still to come into evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1350.761" offset="5507406">Trupiano raised some, I think, very definite problems there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.793" offset="5539589">In terms of results, the cases in this Court which have generally been supported -- it might be noted here, too, that Rabinowitz so often cited as a non-warrant case, was a case, in fact, in which there was a valid arrest warrant and there was every reason to think the very property for which the search was made was in the place which was searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.343" offset="5697787">Every element which would have been necessary to get a search warrant was known to the officer and was almost unquestionably present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.103" offset="5732791">The other cases which have supported similar searches are United States versus Ventresca, Rugendorf, Jones versus the United States 362 U.S., Abel versus U.S. 362, of course Rabinowitz which was with a warrant, U.S. versus Lefkowitz, and Marron versus U.S.</text>

            <text syncTime="3396.820" offset="13691674">The officer proceeded as quickly as he could.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.983" offset="13700347">He took only 45 minutes to search.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.056" offset="13712572">And then the officer took the defendant to the station and the two of them compiled an inventory of all of the seized property, defendant was shown the inventory and he signed a copy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.161" offset="13761055">Now, what can be unreasonable in this search?</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.381" offset="13769937">Certainly, not the scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.365" offset="13777878">The scope was certainly proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.580" offset="13790730">The objective of returning the coins to their stolen -- owner -- to the owner rather -- the returning the stolen coins to the owner would not be served by arbitrarily saying, “Well, you can search this room, but not that one, this cupboard, not that one.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.447" offset="13850185">If we started setting down standards like that, the police and the Courts would certainly be confused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.149" offset="13881010">What size of a room could you search?</text>

            <text syncTime="3448.564" offset="13898668">We submit that the Rabinowitz standard of reasonableness under all the circumstances is the proper standard especially in light of the fact that we have a state conviction here, under our federal system, and under the Court's decision in Ker, the States may develop workable rules of search and seizure.</text>

            <text syncTime="4623.693" offset="18599142">And as we have attempted to point out in our brief, California affords many, many opportunities at all stages of the proceedings to invoke the exclusionary rule and that means has certainly been effective, if not more effective, than the somewhat cursory examination which is given prior to issuing a search warrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="4710.100" offset="18944794">To pursue this same point a little bit on the matter of warrants, I have shortly before coming here contacted the clerk of the Municipal Court in Los Angeles Judicial District, who is one of the few agencies in California, or anywhere, so far as I can find out, who has some statistical information available on search warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4737.504" offset="19054404">To give you an idea of what Los Angeles Judicial District comprises, the entire county is authorized 125 Municipal Court Judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="4747.614" offset="19094841">Los Angeles Judicial District, which is within that county, comprises 58 of those 125 judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="4756.434" offset="19130159">So we have something here which is approaching half of the entire county.</text>
            <text syncTime="4763.108" offset="19156804">In 1931, according to the letters I have, the clerk of this Court commenced keeping separate records of search warrants issued and papers received for search warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4775.468" offset="19206228">They were numbered serially, commencing with the number 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="4779.835" offset="19223782">As of March 12, 1969, these numbers had reached 1938 or, in other words, during this period of time, there had been approximately some 50 warrants per year, or something like that, although this is not a fair representation, since in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="4811.297" offset="19349588">According to advice I have personally received from the clerk, there were papers processed in this Judicial District for 179 search warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4822.874" offset="19395877">So the figure has gone up, but it was to me amazingly low for a 38-year period.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="keith_c_monroe" startTime="4849.853" stopTime="5015.151">
            <label>Mr. Keith C. Monroe</label>
            <text syncTime="4849.853" offset="19503815">I do not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="4856.194" offset="19529206">Turning to Rabinowitz, I think it is necessary to look to the Fourth Amendment itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4866.211" offset="19569225">I think we can see rather clearly two distinct philosophies in interpretation of the amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4874.663" offset="19603080">Rabinowitz and Harris, in that line of cases, say not in so many words, but in terms of results they say, the Fourth Amendment consists of two clauses, one which prohibits unreasonable searches, and the other clause sets forth the procedure for obtaining warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4899.007" offset="19700464">The opposing line of cases is, of course, Trupiano, Taylor versus U.S., and those similar cases which say this is not true, rather, there is a general requirement in the amendment which points to the use of warrants and with or without a warrant, any search which is unreasonable does not comply with the amendment itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4925.342" offset="19805790">The question which troubles me greatly in the Rabinowitz-Harris philosophy is that if the unreasonable search clause can stand by itself, and if there is not some requirement somewhere for the use of warrants as a general rule, but if unreasonable searches covers the ground, then we've violated a cardinal principle of statutory construction, because the unreasonable search clause really covers the substance of what's in the warrant clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4965.585" offset="19966704">It's not necessary to have the warrant language there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4969.217" offset="19981228">And on that basis, I would submit that there must be something more to the amendment which suggests that under some conditions a warrant is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="4981.427" offset="20030130">The facts in this case, I think illustrate with the search of a home, with very ample time, in fact conceded no exigent circumstances, grave question about cause for searching.</text>
            <text syncTime="4996.347" offset="20089793">If this case doesn't require a search warrant, I ask what case possibly could, and if there is not a case that possibly could require a warrant, then the Fourth Amendment itself is changed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="5015.151" stopTime="5077.217">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="5015.151" offset="20165026">Well, of course, the development of this whole field, like so many areas of the law, hasn't been strictly logical.</text>
            <text syncTime="5027.931" offset="20216121">If you take the first philosophy, or what you call the Harris philosophy, through its logical conclusion and say that all the Fourth Amendment requires is reasonableness under the circumstances, I would suppose, as a matter of logic, it would follow that if a policeman gets a warrant for the arrest of the man at his house and then finds he doesn't happen to be there, and he gets lawful access to the house because of his warrant, it would be very difficult to see why logically he wouldn't be reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5064.778" offset="20363557">That's the only test.</text>
            <text syncTime="5066.041" offset="20368572">He could go ahead and search the house anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="5070.665" offset="20387067">This whole train of development hasn't been a matter of pure logic by any manner or means, has it?</text>

            <text syncTime="5077.217" offset="20413294">Thus, along that line of thought, Your Honor, that then, would cast doubt on Chapman.</text>
            <text syncTime="5084.928" offset="20444118">It would cast doubt on Taylor.</text>

            <text syncTime="5097.105" offset="20492810">I am suggesting that that is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5098.714" offset="20499289">I am suggesting that the law, if it remains perfectly stable, you can't search without a warrant except in very limited circumstances, one of which is incident to an arrest and, therefore, it's not quite accurate to say that there are two opposite philosophies as regards the interpretation of the Fourth Amendment as a whole, namely, reasonable or logically, a warrant in every case where you can get one feasibly.</text>

            <text syncTime="5129.731" offset="20623318">My purpose in addressing myself to this, Your Honor, was that if the reasonable clause is to be given primary meaning, then there doesn't seem to be any real, strong reason for having the Warrant Clause in the amendment at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5151.757" offset="20711403">For certainly a warrant which was issued without oath or affirmation, or without probable cause, would not, on its face, be reasonable.</text>
