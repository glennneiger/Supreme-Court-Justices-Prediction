            <text syncTime="1605.036" offset="6420062">It's been the law for 53 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.669" offset="6430616">The two sections under attack by the appellants in this case have not had any substantial change throughout that long period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.309" offset="6469172">The portion with which they failed to comply was a provision of that law which states that within five days after the announcement of a candidacy that the candidate is required to file a designation of a committee to receive contributions to handle its funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.341" offset="6541270">The rest of the law imposes a considerable obligation on those individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.263" offset="6573035">It may be the candidate himself, it may be persons he designates but the law imposes a considerable obligation on them with reference to the receipt of funds, the disbursement of funds and ultimately the accounting for funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.873" offset="6619429">And the second section that they attacked contains a mandatory provision that if a candidate fails to comply with that provision, his name will not appear on the ballot.</text>
