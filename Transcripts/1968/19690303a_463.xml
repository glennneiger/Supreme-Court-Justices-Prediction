            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 463, National Labor Relations Board, petitioner, versus Wyman-Gordon Co.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.423" offset="161102">Mr. Solicitor General.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="18.794" offset="178552">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.755" offset="202376">This case presents a question of administrative law, perhaps more suitable to discussion by a law school seminar than meriting extensive consideration by this Court because I believe that there are decisions of the Court which, though not directly authoritatively appoint, point the way to the decision which should be reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.164" offset="328077">The legal problem began in 1966, when the National Labor Relations Board decided the case of Excelsior Underwear Company in 156 NLRB.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.691" offset="390144">This opinion appears in full twice in the papers before the Court, once as appendix C to the petition for certiorari at pages 14 (a) through 33 (a), and also in the appendix or record at pages 12-28.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.391" offset="488887">The Excelsior case involved a representation election proceeding under Section 9 (c) (1) of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.850" offset="546774">The vote went strongly against the Labor Union, petitioner, in that case and it filed objections to the conduct of the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.268" offset="584495">One of the objections was, and I quote from page 13 of the appendix, “the employer's conduct,” right at the middle of the page, “the employer's conduct in refusing to supply the Union with a list of employees and their addresses for the purpose of allowing the Union to answer the letter referred to in objection number one.”</text>
            <text syncTime="149.423" offset="701106">In due course, the Excelsior case and another case came before the Board for a hearing and it determined, and here I quote from page 14 of the appendix, this too being in the Excelsior opinion, “that the employer's denial of the petitioner's request where the names and addresses of employees eligible to vote in the elections in these two cases presented a question of substantial importance in the administration of the National Labor Relations Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="186.638" offset="849899">And, the Board then invited further briefs on this issue from the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.406" offset="872991">It also invited other interested parties to file briefs amici and to participate in the oral argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="213.544" offset="957524">In other words, this-- unlike the rule making procedure, this was not left open for anybody in this system.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="218.180" offset="976123">The opinion says that the Board invited certain interested parties to file briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.613" offset="997857">It was not like the rule making procedure where there is a notice and whoever becomes aware of that notice can participate in filing briefs.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="241.637" offset="1069955">Yes, but a rather representative group.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.226" offset="1080299">There were two national employer's associations and six labor unions which participated, but I agree, it is not the procedure prescribed by the Administrative Procedure Act for rule making.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.243" offset="1144351">If it had been, the case would not be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.574" offset="1161697">Arguments were held on May 20, 1965 and, on the basis of the briefs and oral arguments, the Board entered its decision on February 4, 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.200" offset="1224182">That appears on page 33 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.781" offset="1242467">In its decision, the Board concluded that higher standards of disclosure than we have here, before, imposed are necessary, and it established a requirement that will be applied in all lection -- election cases, quoting from page 17 of the appendix.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="306.075" offset="1327626">That's the point, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.322" offset="1336613">It did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.344" offset="1344763">Under this requirement, let me state the requirement and then state what's next.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.086" offset="1363675">Under this requirement, “within seven days after the Regional Director has approved a consent election agreement, the employer must file with the Regional Director an election eligibility list containing the names and addresses of all of the eligible voters and this information is then made available to all of the parties in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.607" offset="1465762">Now, in answer to Mr. Justice Harlan's question, I refer to footnote 5 of the Board's opinion on page 17, the second paragraph of that footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.492" offset="1525321">The same thing also appears later at the conclusion of the opinion on page 27, but what the Board said there was “however, the rule we have here announced is to be applied prospectively only.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.178" offset="1584044">It will not apply in the instant cases, but only in those elections that are directed or consented to, subsequent to 30 days from the date of this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.022" offset="1631483">We impose this brief period of delay to ensure that all parties to forthcoming representation elections are fully aware of their rights and obligations as here stated.”</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="397.037" offset="1691564">So, the effect of this was to prevent any judicial review?</text>
            <text syncTime="401.568" offset="1709641">The Excelsior case itself, I suppose, because the Excelsior case decided in the favor of the employer, didn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="532.330" offset="2232717">This was the background of the present case which began on July 12, 1966, about five months after the Excelsior case was decided when the International Union of Boilermakers filed a petition seeking to represent the employees of the respondent company.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.098" offset="2319757">Another Union also intervened.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.179" offset="2332087">The Regional Director determined that an election should be held, and he directed that the company, as required by the Board's Excelsior decision, furnish a list of the names and addresses of the eligible voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.829" offset="2394676">The company refused to furnish the list.</text>

            <text syncTime="579.884" offset="2422888">The Unions objected because of the company's failure to provide the list of names and addresses.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.065" offset="2451623">This objection was sustained by the Regional Director and by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.404" offset="2472939">And, the Regional Director again directed the company to provide an employee list.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.418" offset="2501047">When the company again refused, the Regional Director issued a subpoena requiring the company to produce its books and records showing the names and addresses of its employees or, in the alternative, to furnish a list containing that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.661" offset="2573981">The Board denied the motion -- the company's motion to quash the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.277" offset="2596446">When the company still refused to comply, the Board brought an action in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts to enforce the subpoena or, in the alternative, or a mandatory injunction directing the company to comply with the Excelsior requirement, and that is this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.316" offset="2688606">The District Court granted an order enforcing the subpoena.</text>

            <text syncTime="1491.271" offset="6068433">Nevertheless, in determining what is adjudication, it seems to me, not inappropriate to look to what Courts do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.404" offset="6117021">And, decisions which are prospective only in their operation have been known in this Court at least as far back as the Sunburst Oil and Refining case in 287 US, some-35 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.763" offset="6198418">In recent years, this Court has frequently decided that certain decisions should and can be applied prospectively only and no one has opposed that the Court was not adjudicating, not acting as a Court, when it did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.091" offset="6275741">Several of these cases are cited on pages 22 and 23 of this brief, I haven't had a chance to study the opinions, but Allen against the State Board of Elections decided this morning appears to be another one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.512" offset="6333419">And, perhaps the cases closest to the present situation are England against the Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners in 375 US and James against the United States in 366 US.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.109" offset="6395800">In both of which, this Court announced rules in the James case overruling an earlier case in the England case, clarifying a situation which was uncertain as somewhat as in the Excelsior case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.492" offset="6461315">And, in each case, the Court, for one reason or another, reasons of fairness to the parties in the particular case, announced that the rule would not be applied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.155" offset="6503946">In the England case, this Court's words were “on the record in the instant case, the rule we announce today would call for affirmance of the District Court's judgment, but we are unwilling to apply the rule against these appellants.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.594" offset="6573746">No one has ever contended that, in the England case or in the James case, that the Court was engaged in rule making.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.298" offset="6608541">On the contrary, in both cases, this Court was acting as a Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.378" offset="6628916">It was deciding the cases hen before it and articulating the somewhat complicated reason which led it to the conclusion which it then reached.</text>

            <text syncTime="1697.456" offset="6893171">Indeed, the Commissioner's hearing examiner had said that these matters are not involved in this case and no consideration has been given to them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2024.011" offset="8199398">I would like to direct myself to a question that you asked, Mr. Justice, of the Solicitor General as to why the Board does not use the rule making powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.484" offset="8249344">I think one of the reasons is explicit here because they developed the Excelsior rule in a fashion and in a manner which it was not directly subject to Court review either by the Excelsior Company or by any other company in the country that was involved in the various Excelsior cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.870" offset="8338892">The Solicitor General has indicated that the Wyman-Gordon Co. refused, refused, and refused as though we were doing something illegal and not complying with the Board's Excelsior rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.733" offset="8394271">Actually, we were doing the only thing which we could do in order to test the Excelsior rule because of the way that the Board had promulgated it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.688" offset="8454144">I think that the Administrative Procedure Act and the National Labor Relations Act make it very clear that the Board should and must follow the Administrative Procedure Act in promulgating its rules, even though it is arbitrarily for the last 30-odd years, refused to follow this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.736" offset="8550275">You asked the question as to whether an attorney representing a client could look to the Federal Register and find out what the Board's rules were or whether he could -- it would be necessary for him to go into the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.656" offset="8617984">Well, actually, I have found over the course of the years that when I advice a client on Friday what he can do under the National Labor Relations Act, I must also advice him that, on Monday morning, I may change my opinion and tell him what he could do on Friday he couldn't do on Monday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.531" offset="8685484">I think that the Board, and now I'm getting away from my argument, the Board should be required to follow the Administrative Procedure Act because it is the duty of the Board to stabilize labor relations in this nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.918" offset="8743058">And, actually, what they have done by proceeding on an ad hoc basis, they have unstabilized labor relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.468" offset="8769285">The point that lawyers advice their client at their peril, and I think that if the Board were to make extensive use of their rule making power, all of this confusion would be --</text>

            <text syncTime="3110.417" offset="12545024">The Board states that there's a two-fold purpose in deciding Excelsior.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.229" offset="12564250">One is to improve communications between Union business agents and perspective Union members and, two, it is to minimize challenges to voters after an election has been held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.104" offset="12627780">And yet, when you analyze it, the Board has adopted what I consider per se rule here and says that only in this manner can Unions properly inform the electric of the issues involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.002" offset="12695385">And yet, the Board, in holding to Excelsior, has refused to admit any other means of communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.474" offset="12729240">In one case which is currently pending petition for certiorari in Teledyne, the Board refused to permit the mailing of notices or solicitations by an in -- disinterested third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.496" offset="12813354">In Teledyne, for example, at first, Teledyne Corporation stated that there would be no prohibition for solicitation of Union membership in the plant and in working -- unworking time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.691" offset="12870092">The Board refused to accept this as sufficient form of communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.537" offset="12889527">Teledyne then offered to send each employee the stamped envelope addressed to the Regional Director of the National Labor Relations Board an telling the Regional Director that he had the right to give his name and address to the Unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.126" offset="12951907">Finally, Teledyne offered to the use of the American Arbitration Association, offered at its own expense, Teledyne's expense to mail to the Union any communications that the Unions wished.</text>

            <text syncTime="3229.643" offset="13021915">I think that their argument that this is to favor communications is not exactly truthful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.704" offset="13054203">I think what they're actually trying to do is to encourage Union business agents, Union officials to visit these employees in their homes, and this is the sole reason why they're doing it and yet, at the same time, it has long been established that if an employer, during an election campaign, visits the employee's home to discuss Union matters with him, automatically commits an unfair labor practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3391.329" offset="13668707">I think that the fallacy of listening of challenges by the use of the Excelsior list is clearly demonstrated in our brief at page 4 where, of approximately 1,750 voters, there are exactly six challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.125" offset="13751881">Now, I don't know how many -- what percentage figure that works out t, but it certainly indicates that challenges had no real place in the Wyman-Gordon election in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.733" offset="13802350">Further, I have analyzed the 30th annual report of the Labor Board which is from the count for the fiscal year 1965 and the annual report for fiscal year 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.365" offset="13872880">These are the years -- full year prior to Excelsior and the full year after Excelsior.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.529" offset="13901511">In 1965, there were 7 -- some-7,776 elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.380" offset="13932857">In its annual report, they have a table 11 which has listed the cha -- cases in which challenges have been involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.909" offset="13974967">They list under the heading of “challenges only.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.960" offset="13987192">There are 312 elections out of the 7,000 involving challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.780" offset="14014464">Thus, only 4.01% out of all the election cases held, the year prior to Excelsior, involved challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.458" offset="14057200">Turning then to the Sixth 32nd annual report, it shows that in the fiscal year 1967 8,116 elections were held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.814" offset="14106624">In table 11, it indicates under “challenges only” that there were 371 elections in which challenges were held, this results in a 4.5% of the -- cases of the elections held by the Board in fiscal 1957 involving challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.080" offset="14191679">The improvement factor after the Excelsior requirement was put into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.354" offset="14220831">It's a -56 -- -0.56%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.020" offset="14239431">So, the Board by its own records clearly shows that the Excelsior rule has no bearing whatsoever on minimizing challenges after the election.</text>
