            <label>Mr. Anthony G. Amsterdam</label>
            <text syncTime="22.596" offset="193808">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.582" offset="213661">This is a federal habeas corpus proceeding on behalf of William Maxwell.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.000" offset="239365">It condemned challenging the sentence of death imposed upon him by an Arkansas jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.201" offset="276146">Unlike the Boykin case which the Court has just heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.948" offset="295163">No question is presented here with regard to the ultimate power of the State of Arkansas to use death as a penalty for crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.100" offset="339780">Even for the crime of rape of which William Maxwell was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.920" offset="363081">The Questions presented relate entirely to the procedures by which the death penalty is administered in the State of Arkansas and by which out of the total number of persons convicted of the crime of rape, some are selected to live and others are selected to die.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.609" offset="449808">We have two federal constitutional claims against the Arkansas procedure which for short reference I may term the standards claim and the single verdict claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.394" offset="520965">In order to put this into prospective and to show their relationship because I think they are eminently related.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.874" offset="554820">I would like to take a hard look at the outset if I may at the procedure by which Arkansas does determine case by case and individual cases whether persons convicted of rape shall live or shall go to their death in the electric chair.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.477" offset="633292">Now under Arkansas law, there is one statutory provision which provides that the punishment for the crime of rape is death.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.149" offset="675924">In other statute, in effect since 1915 provides that in any case in which the punishment is death by law, the jury may return instead a verdict of imprisonment for life in state penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.273" offset="736423">The effect of these two statutes therefore is to create an authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.362" offset="760769">The availability of returning the death penalty in a broad range of cases but to require the death penalty and not thereby both supposing that selection is possible among the total number of persons convicted of rape and requiring that selection must in fact be made among the total number of persons convicted of rape of some smaller number who shall suffer death, the extreme penalty for that crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.985" offset="883336">Now, it’s not surprising that such a selective process is set in motion by Arkansas law because the crime of rape is in Arkansas as elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.338" offset="924714">A crime that includes a wide range of factual situations, it is simply any consummated sexual assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.569" offset="961599">It can be committed against a mature woman, against a child, with a weapon endangering life, or not endangering life.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.121" offset="991901">The victim can be permanently, physically injured or not permanently physically injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.087" offset="1011754">Tremendous range of factual situations involved any large range of offenders and in fact on this record one can say that only about a quarter, 25 out of a 100 of the persons actually convicted of rape get to death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.225" offset="1080299">Now, I put the focus here at the beginning to point out what I -- where I think the focus has to be in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.543" offset="1109556">On the process by which that selective judgment is made, this is not an insignificant or non-important process.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.178" offset="1136097">It is literally vital but it is also vital and legal sense because the law of Arkansas as to whether rape is or is not a capital offense is in fact being made case by case as in each individual adjudication the determination is made whether the defendant lives or dies.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.716" offset="1206209">It is a law making process the penalty for rape in Arkansas is not death.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.996" offset="1231391">It is subjection to this decisional process and the question which this case presents is whether the specific procedure here is in Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.934" offset="1267127">To make that decision, comport with the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.523" offset="1281442">Now, how is the decision in fact made.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.287" offset="1296488">It is made in each case by a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.645" offset="1305997">A jury cannot be waived in a death case in Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.433" offset="1325119">If as petitioner Maxwell did, the defending contest guilt if the intensity is innocent, a jury is in impaneled to decide two distinct questions whether he is guilty of the crime of rape and if so, what punishment shall be imposed upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.846" offset="1390738">As to the first of these two decisions whether or not the defendant is guilty of rape, the jury is guided as it is in any criminal case by the law defining the crime of rape and the trial in the capital case in Arkansas is not unusual in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.148" offset="1451969">The jury can’t convict the defendant simply because they don’t like him or because he’s unpleasant or because they don’t like the color or his skin or for any other reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.883" offset="1482898">It can convict him only if they find each element of the offense established beyond a reasonable doubt on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.746" offset="1518320">The definition of the crime of rape gives the jury something to talk about.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.401" offset="1532949">When they go back to decide the case, they talk with each other about what is the elements of the offense they’re made out and the rule of law that is being applied by the jury to decide the guilt question and only the guilt question is the same rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.693" offset="1582164">It applies to every other person in Arkansas as previously been tried for rape or will be.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.744" offset="1606301">When we get to the penalty question, on the other hand, we are in a different world because on the penalty question the jury is given no instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.346" offset="1656769">The jury is given no principles to guide its decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.660" offset="1674010">The ordinary procedure in Arkansas is simply to give the jury two forms, a death form which rates we find the defending guilty as charge and a life form which says we find the defendant guilty as charge and sentence him to imprisonment for life.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.181" offset="1736077">No instructions are given.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.524" offset="1741511">The jury is simply told, take your choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.471" offset="1753213">Now, we have characterized that process of decision making in our brief not in the constitutional sense or simply a descriptive sense as arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.192" offset="1800129">And I might rest on that because neither California nor Arkansas in response as coupled with that question only they defend the process of sentencing as I understand it on the ground that it constitutes a beneficent arbitrariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.531" offset="1861465">But I think it is helpful to examine in somewhat more detail exactly what is entailed in what I call an arbitrary process.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.206" offset="1908172">The jury is given in making its determination of life or death a choice which it may make without any prerequisite findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.671" offset="1950072">That is to say the ordinary procedures that we all know as lawyers, it ordinarily go on in courts of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.040" offset="1971493">Where a judge says to a jury if you find “x” then the result would be “y.”</text>
            <text syncTime="473.077" offset="1995630">Simply it doesn’t apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.062" offset="1999600">There are no required findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.699" offset="2010154">The jury need not find that the defendant use the weapon or permanently injured the victim or that he had a prior record or any such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.282" offset="2048502">Any and every offense of rape may be punished by death nor required findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.510" offset="2069400">Not only are there no specific required findings of fact in the nature of aggravating circumstances in that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.305" offset="2092596">There are no general findings of fact put to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.473" offset="2105240">The question is not asked would society be safe if this man were incarcerated in the penitentiary for life.</text>

            <text syncTime="515.706" offset="2166157">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.880" offset="2178905">If I may, I would like to resume a brief description of the exact nature of the discretion that the Arkansas jury has in capital sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.403" offset="2224985">As I have said, there are no prerequisite factual findings to return a death verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.616" offset="2249853">The jury may need to find nothing specific in aggravation.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.745" offset="2266363">Of the sort that for example the European Codes used that the offense was committed with the weapon or that the defendant had a prior conviction of a similar offense or any such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.663" offset="2306069">There are -- is no general required finding of fact such as that the defendant is unreformable or recidivist or incurable or any such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.626" offset="2341909">There are no preclusive findings of fact that is findings which will exclude the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.116" offset="2363852">The jury is not told if you find that the defendant was suffering a mental disease or defect which rendered him unstable or that the defendant has no prior record or that the victim did not use a great degree of force and resistance or that the defendant did not use the weapon you may not sentence to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.296" offset="2440547">And there are similarly no general preclusive findings of the nature of emotional disorder or any such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.287" offset="2472521">There is no direction to the jury that it shall take consideration of any particular range or realm of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.042" offset="2503555">The jury is not told in deciding whether the sentence to defend into life or death you shall take into account whether the defendant used the weapon or whether the victim was previously chased or the character of the defendant or any of those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.189" offset="2560084">There’s not even an authorization which would direct their attention to some things you may take account of such and such and the jury is not told that there are things they may not take account of.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.243" offset="2596342">You may not take account of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.233" offset="2604283">You may not take account of anything that the legislature thinks irrelevant to its purposes in enacting the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.308" offset="2632600">There are no principles for judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.978" offset="2643257">No standards for judgments given to the jury at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.658" offset="2661961">Not even a kind of vague standard that is the minimum we use in any kind of other judicial proceedings such as reasonable man.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.688" offset="2690173">It’s sometimes easy to forget how much the reasonable man standard does direct the jury in a civil damage case.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.084" offset="2719744">At least the jury knows that the defendant’s obligation is to exercise reasonable care, the care that the reasonable man would exercise toward the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.130" offset="2755897">Our whole law assumes that that has significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.228" offset="2764257">It’s different from the duty the defendant owes to a trespasser to exercise somewhat less care that he might owe to someone who he has special duty to care for.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.541" offset="2801560">The jury in the civil case isn’t told that they may return a verdict against the defendant if they don’t like him or if there’s something offensive about him or any such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.753" offset="2834369">The issue is framed.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.751" offset="2838340">He owes a duty of care.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.273" offset="2844505">How much care?</text>
            <text syncTime="685.917" offset="2847013">The care that a reasonable man would exercise.</text>

            <text syncTime="735.030" offset="3043453">One is that the judges are professional sentencer and although we certainly make no attack on the jury system as such we think that we need not get any or near attacking the jury as an administrator of rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="985.151" offset="4043943">Our contention is limited to capital cases and the justification for us so limiting it is -- it lies in three things I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.571" offset="4073618">First, this Court has made clear for considerable period of time that the degree of arbitrariness, it is permissible in a sentencing system is less where the penalty is grave where I speak of Skinner and Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.866" offset="4134849">Now Skinner held that you couldn’t sterilize thieves if you didn’t sterilize embezzlements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.114" offset="4159822">I think that nobody on the unanimous court have decided that case assume that indeed the opinions of the contrary that you couldn’t sentence embezzlers to 15 years and certain thieves to 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.134" offset="4203917">At that level of discrimination or determination, there’s no question about distinguishing between embezzlers and thieves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.286" offset="4228472">When you sterilize them or when you kill them, that’s something else again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.238" offset="4244355">The second consideration I think is that and this goes to Mr. Justice White’s point as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.544" offset="4273507">That when you are dealing with a non-capital sentencing regime, there are number of considerations that come into play that justify more arbitrary individualize judgments than when you’re dealing with a capital sentencing regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.643" offset="4337977">Non-capital sentencing inevitably involves in some point the question of reformation and the only tools with which we as a society at the moment come to grips with the question of reformation are the highly individualize diagnostic judgment that are made of particular individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.857" offset="4406836">Now I myself have very serious troubles with the infusion of therapy in the sentencing because sentencing becomes a mixed bag of individual I supposedly helpful therapeutic considerations and penal judgments but the question is to what kind of standards to imply on that process is much a little more like the question involved in the McGautha case as to how much you can justify some arbitrariness in the imposition of penal sanctions in order to serve therapeutic ends which require extreme flexibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.029" offset="4543509">In capital sentencing, there is no therapeutic need and no therapeutic justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.613" offset="4561795">The death penalty is the one penalty of which one can say cannot be justified for purposes of reformation or rehabilitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.294" offset="4592515">It is a writing off of this human preacher as fit for rehabilitation and no individualize judgments of the sort that need to be made diagnostically enter into the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.636" offset="4633893">So that there’s no excuse for the degree of individualization without rules of law in capital sentencing that there is non-capital sentencing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1221.075" offset="4987695">I think there’s a difference between the judge and the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.066" offset="4995636">I think that the (Inaudible) case which requires certain standards for jury action may not mean that a judge has sub-standards in taxing costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.823" offset="5030640">I think that the parameters, the outer boundaries of judgment are very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.481" offset="5049344">If I may let me try to frame this issue in terms of one that is more familiar to this court’s jurisprudence historically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.366" offset="5084871">The question that is raise as I see by our standards attack is in not a typical question of how you limit discretion and keep it within constitutional confines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.727" offset="5134294">If you take for example a legislature that wants to regulate parades in the state it could simply pass a permit statute that says no one may conduct a procession without the permit from the chief of police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.289" offset="5188524">Now that would raise the greatest constitutional difficulties under the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.917" offset="5207019">Now if it wanted to enact to one that delimited the discretion how might it go about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.538" offset="5225514">There are whole host of ways in which it might go about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.215" offset="5236276">One it might say whoever conducts a procession with vehicles or a procession on the streets or a procession on Pennsylvania Avenue between 14th Street and the capital that delimits the range of cases within which the judgment is being made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.634" offset="5301896">Secondly, it might say that in determining whether a permit shall issue the chief of police shall take account of traffic congestion, the movement of emergency vehicles, simply whether there is another parade or procession the same day and that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.345" offset="5368769">Third, it might subject the judgment of the permit issuer to review by another agency by a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.677" offset="5398131">Now each one of this without getting rid of discretion totally delimits the discretion and again it would make a considerable difference whether the permit is totally unavailable or whether the permit issuer only had the power to put it off for a day set it some time within the week but not in a particular day requested and that sort of thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1506.198" offset="6128201">And as I was trying to sketch out, it makes for me a great deal of difference whether the discretion is limited by a review or whether it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.324" offset="6168639">That’s one of the factors that makes the discretion given juries in death cases totally arbitrary with no restraint, no protection against us.</text>

            <text syncTime="1547.384" offset="6292877">The Arkansas jury not only makes the guilt and penalty determinations but make some at one sitting if the defendant contests guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.062" offset="6339584">All the evidence be it on all questions is submitted at once.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.812" offset="6354631">The jury goes out and returns a verdict both on guilt and on punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.174" offset="6376051">Now, the effect of this, the most immediate effect of this is fairly obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.036" offset="6403532">If the defendant takes the stand to speak to have his voice heard by the people of the power of life and death decision over him, he runs into all of the prejudices that the privilege against self-incrimination is intended to protect him against.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.277" offset="6468524">First, if he takes the stand and doesn’t claim innocence he is going to be convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.695" offset="6490154">There is just no doubt that the jury will convict him when he gets on the stand, testifies and doesn’t say, I didn’t do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1618.877" offset="6578866">Literally, every bad act however remote and whether reduced to conviction or not can come in against them with inevitable prejudice on the guilt determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1652.254" offset="6712404">So, I think the remoteness requirement is insignificant and the practical fact of the matter is that however prejudicial, for example we have cited in our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1953.453" offset="7917171">The pretrial order of the federal district judge in this case provided that the transcript would be available and that portions of it might be put in to the record by counsel if they wish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.122" offset="7963878">No portions were formally put into the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.094" offset="7975790">On the other hand, the trial transcript had been around in the district court for a long while.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.805" offset="7990627">This being Maxwell second habeas corpus petition and the district judge in fact relied on it in some part although none of it was formally introduced for some of his findings such as a finding that Maxwell did not take the stand.</text>

            <text syncTime="2074.018" offset="8399496">We contend that the power given Arkansas jury’s to sentence to life or death is legally arbitrary in violation in the rule of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.085" offset="8447666">It offense we think every aspect of the rule of law that this Court has found previously in the due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.539" offset="8489566">First of all, it involves sentencing on a case by case basis by jurors who need not even discuss why they choose to send the man to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.351" offset="8536795">If they do discuss why and they decide on a common ground, there is no assurance that that ground is common to any other defendant but this defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.706" offset="8574203">The man who was just tried and just convicted and just sentenced to life might have facts like identical with those of the defendant who now goes to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.034" offset="8607535">The only difference being that because Arkansas provides no help, the jury state different views neither of the facts but of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.441" offset="8645151">A necessary consequence of that kind of arbitrariness and decision making is that people are unequally treated in violation of the notion basic we submit to both due process in equal protection that requires evenhanded administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.439" offset="8713174">People treated similarly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.594" offset="8721742">It doesn’t mean no individualization in sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.045" offset="8735535">But it means individualization on a rational basis not on a hit or miss flip basis that arises from having no standards whatever from making the sentencing decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.925" offset="8775032">It also means that not only are the people who are sentence to death treated unevenly, unequally as against those sentenced to life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.473" offset="8813275">But they are treated irrationally, in the sense that there is no relationship, no assured connection between the purposes for having a death penalty at all and its imposition in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2318.168" offset="9376057">No, I think, I think not except to the extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.758" offset="9390373">It does come to the interrelatedness of our two arguments where you have a split verdict procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.540" offset="9413569">We have a two-trial procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.732" offset="9422346">The effect may be different because the jury has a plenary penalty trial as more to basic judgment on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.295" offset="9444603">But in specific response to Your Honor’s question, the answer is that they are equally without standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.976" offset="9467277">Frankly, what has happened simply is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.636" offset="9477935">The legislature had passed the buck all over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.956" offset="9487235">We have mandatory capital sentencing for an off a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.350" offset="9504789">And when that became politically impossible to maintain, instead of proceeding to determine in what case is the death penalty would be implied the legislatures all over simply said we can’t decide this so I’m going to pass it under the jury and they simply made it discretionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.771" offset="9566438">They did -- they are differing forms of substance of crime, differing procedures the notions of discretion is essentially common.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.107" offset="9599770">Now the -- a third, I think vitally important thing you recognize in the regime which is common and in practice in Arkansas is simply that the jury can get away with the most flagrant violations of clear constitutional rights without getting caught at.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.744" offset="9686392">One of the purposes of the rule of law of the requirement that procedures be regular systematically apply and applicable to all like cases is simply to prevent against abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.361" offset="9740831">Now what we have in Arkansas and this is what I think is the relevance of the racial evidence on this record is a sentencing pattern of clear racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.672" offset="9782105">It couldn’t be caught said the District Court because the factors that go into the jury’s decision case by case are so intangible, so difficult to catch on to that you can’t prove that even a jury which even a set of juries of which convict Negroes of raping white victims and sentence them to death disproportionately frequently or in fact discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.626" offset="9881893">We don’t know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.068" offset="9883669">They may be all sorts of intangible factors other than race that affects it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.373" offset="9900910">The Eighth Circuit took the view that somewhat more hardheaded that probably juries are in fact discriminated generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.830" offset="9934660">But Maxwell’s theory probably didn’t discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.769" offset="9946467">Again, how do you know?</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.262" offset="9952423">There’s no way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.845" offset="9954722">The jury didn’t have to have any reason little on any specific reason for fixing the death penalty and so what happens under a regime of this sort is not only that the giving up of all political responsibility in the representatives of the people, legislature to fix standards of general application passing the buck in effect to individual juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.052" offset="10043538">But when individual juries react in a way which violates the most clear and unequivocal commands of the Constitution, a court can’t catch them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.000" offset="10079378">Now, our submission essentially is that such a regime violates a rule of law basic to do process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.393" offset="10104978">That there is in here in the very notion of due process of law, the requirement of a rule of law which governs light cases and applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.247" offset="10140400">I think that this Court would not for example sustain an Arkansas sentencing procedure which provided that every man convicted of rape should roll a dice and if it came up 7 or 11, he would die.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.049" offset="10199542">And any other numbers, he would live.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.699" offset="10210200">Actually, what Arkansas has done is worst.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.661" offset="10222007">It’s worst because I assume that the dice would not discriminate on grounds of race and its worst because the 2 out of 12 chances that each man would have are at least identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.289" offset="10284492">We have not even that assurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.158" offset="10292015">And the argument is made by Arkansas and it’s made by California and everybody is being treated evenhandedly and equally under the sentencing procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="2688.796" offset="10858559">Let me respond to that in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.599" offset="10865768">First, by saying that I have in mind something not terribly unlike the approach taken by the Model Penal Code although that’s not an exclusive approach and then although again I voice caution for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.254" offset="10908400">First of all the Model Penal Codes description of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances and that sort of thing applies to murder and not rape and so it’s of no use particularly in drafting a rape statute and also because I have very grave trouble about certain of the specific formulations of the Model Penal Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.513" offset="10989380">For example, one of the aggravating circumstances that is it a crime is attrocious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.831" offset="11006725">That troubles me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.047" offset="11011532">I think that they could describe and get out what they want in terms of it being committed on a minor child or helpless person or being committed with considerable willful infliction of pain so that there are number of details about the Model Penal Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.974" offset="11071300">I might quarrel that the approach is a not insignificant model.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.440" offset="11089168">Now, second way to respond to that is to try to give you what I think of it some ways in which a legislature concerned with the crime of rape might put standards into a sentencing statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.391" offset="11144965">One way, they might go about it is in the manner I suggested in describing what Arkansas didn’t have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.445" offset="11165132">You can have required factual findings, prerequisite factual findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.517" offset="11189478">You can consider them if you will aggravate in circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.380" offset="11200867">The jury may not impose the death penalty unless it finds that the defendant used a weapon that he injured the victim permanently in a physical way that he committed the offense on a victim of gravely disparate age.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.745" offset="11278399">One can enumerate half dozen by of course, it simply indicate that’s one approach.</text>

            <text syncTime="2798.025" offset="11295431">It would say the diffuculty that that raises I’m sure it’s obvious to you is that suppose a legislature says, “Oh, no, no, no Mr. Amsterdam, that’s not what we mean.</text>

            <text syncTime="2870.798" offset="11586539">I have trouble in conceiving the matter that way for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.070" offset="11603675">One, the Arkansas legislature hasn’t release any other kind of rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.536" offset="11617468">It said that that penalty is available for any other kind of rape but we don’t really expect that it will be impose of any other kind of rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.117" offset="11643800">It’s going to be imposed either wholly or arbitrarily or in some set of sub-classes and it’s made no attempt whatever to define those sub-classes but in addition to that this is only one of the ways in which a legislature might regularize the procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.514" offset="11701478">If a legislature said that the governing issue was the atrocity of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.118" offset="11723839">At least that would allow the jury to consider that in focus as distinguished from the character of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.183" offset="11748080">If the legislature said yes, any old kind of rape but the issue is how bad is the defendant?</text>

            <text syncTime="3974.377" offset="16000920">That’s correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3975.031" offset="16003532">Well, basically the, it seems to me the same rule is followed in Arkansas as far as the lack of any standards or any restrictions on the jury is concerned is precisely the same rule that this Court required in the Winston case some 70 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3992.317" offset="16072600">When you held that it was improper for a trial judge to give a standard to the jury and to say to them you should return a death sentence unless you find mitigating circumstances in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4004.812" offset="16122650">Now you held that was not correct that the trial judge should leave it to the jury in their absolute discretion and not tilt the scale one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="4015.037" offset="16163506">Now that is precisely the case in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="4018.042" offset="16175522">And the jury has told that in no uncertain terms and it’s my understanding that that is the case in Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4024.964" offset="16203212">But I want to make it clear that on this question of the unitary trial, we do not express any view because we, in this guilt proceeding, meet the objections that are raised in terms of information being made available to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4045.288" offset="16284505">Both sides are free to put in evidence in mitigation or evidence in aggravation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4051.615" offset="16309791">They’re both free to go into the background of the defendant and to go into anything that is relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4059.295" offset="16340511">Of course it has to be competent evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4061.021" offset="16347408">And it is very common to call psychiatrist.</text>
            <text syncTime="4064.341" offset="16360782">The defendant may call a psychiatrist who says he’s examined the defendant and is familiar with criminal characters and is in his judgment this man can be rehabilitated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4076.906" offset="16411042">Now, there’s all sorts of evidence and certainly all of the things that would go into judge sentencing on the basis of a probation report or a diagnostic reports in our non-capital cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4091.447" offset="16469138">So, I think as far as that objection is raised and of course it’s tied into the lack of standards, we meet that very well in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="4102.127" offset="16511875">Now, I’m not so sure it’s a benefit to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.214" offset="16532250">Certainly, the bifurcated trials enacted as a means of giving a jury the fullest information before past sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4116.518" offset="16569448">And I think that’s a good idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="4118.232" offset="16576345">To say with the benefits, the defendant is something else again because the defendant is stuck with his own record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4124.045" offset="16599542">He made his life and if it hasn’t been a good one he’ll suffer for it in the penalty trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4129.738" offset="16622320">There’s no question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4131.575" offset="16629635">And it can be very difficult for the defendant whether or not in the long run it’s better to bifurcate or whether it’s better and gives the defendant a better shot at it to let it all go in one trial, limit the jury to what’s admissible on the murder charge or rape charge or whatever is quite another question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4155.803" offset="16726601">In any event, we recede on the bifurcated trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4160.477" offset="16745305">We also have some previsions for review which have been mentioned in the briefs particularly filed by the petitioner who argues that the Arkansas jury verdict is under review.</text>

            <text syncTime="4188.264" offset="16856377">At the end of the penalty jury trial, the jury is instructed in a standard instruction that it is the duty of the jury to determine which of the penalty is either death sentence or life imprisonment should we impose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4202.751" offset="16914369">I won’t read the whole thing but just basically, you should consider all of the evidence received here in court presented by the people and defendants throughout the trial before this jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4212.358" offset="16952822">And that would normally include all the evidence on the guilt face as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="4216.757" offset="16970376">You may consider, may also consider all of the evidence of the circumstances surrounding a crime of the defendant’s background and history.</text>
            <text syncTime="4225.161" offset="17004022">And of the facts in aggravation or mitigation of the penalty which has been received here in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4231.212" offset="17028263">However, it is not essential to your decision that you find mitigating circumstances on the one hand or evidence in aggravation of the offense on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="4242.242" offset="17072358">It’s the law of the state that every person guilty of murder in the first degree shall suffer death or confinement in the state prison for life at the discretion of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4255.031" offset="17123453">And then they’re told they have to indicate in their verdict which of the two either death as its put here or life they prefer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4263.935" offset="17159084">And then they’re told there’s notwithstanding facts if any proved in mitigation or aggravation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4271.508" offset="17189386">In determining which punishment shall be inflicted, you are entirely free to act according to your own judgment, conscience, and absolute discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4281.792" offset="17230555">That verdict must express the individual opinion of each juror.</text>
            <text syncTime="4286.937" offset="17251140">Beyond prescribing the two alternative penalties, the law itself provides no standard for the guidance of the jury and the selection of the penalty but rather commits the whole matter of determining which of the two penalties shall be fixed to the judgment, conscience, and absolute discretion of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4303.387" offset="17316968">And the determination of that matter if the jury does agree, it must be anonymous as to which of the two penalties is imposed.</text>

            <text syncTime="4403.050" offset="17715597">I -- we submit that the California procedure and I think it’s basically the same on its element of lack of standards was adopted originally to benefit the defendant -- defendants in capital cases and its easier to say that the legislature passed the buck that it didn’t want to decide the hard question of who should be executed and who shouldn’t be.</text>
            <text syncTime="4429.773" offset="17822490">But I don’t think that was the basis for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4432.366" offset="17832835">I think the basis for it was in the experience of all of us who know anything about capital cases that is impossible, at least I think its impossible to set out in advance those considerations exclusively.</text>

            <text syncTime="4478.657" offset="18017991">The word standard is a word of great difficulty and I think that whether the absence of standards has reaches constitutional proportion is a question that may appear quite differently in the context of Arkansas procedure on the one hand and the context of California’s on the other because it’s at least arguable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4507.531" offset="18133452">I should think that under the California procedure, whether or not you say there are standards, the jury’s attention in the second penalty trial is specifically focused upon the qualitative judgments that I suppose or at least arguably relevant to the kind of penalty that ought to be imposed whereas in the Arkansas procedure as I understand it that this moment that does not happen therefore the two systems in this respect are not necessary properly equated even before the application of constitutional concepts.</text>

            <text syncTime="4813.402" offset="19357027">Now those are some of the things but if I could come back to this basic idea, it seems to me its base on two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="4818.847" offset="19378761">One is the, as I said, it’s so difficult to attempt to formulate in advance this considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4827.158" offset="19411989">And the result is that a case comes along where you -- where everybody involved feels that the death sentence should not be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4836.082" offset="19447724">But it may not fall within some predetermined categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="4840.533" offset="19465488">And when you get into things like pity and sympathy and kindness and compassion, how you can reduce that to any kind of a standard and the due process sense of the statute defining conduct?</text>
            <text syncTime="4856.073" offset="19527659">I don’t understand in the petitioners haven’t told us.</text>
            <text syncTime="4860.307" offset="19544586">Again in California, for example the jury is told in the guilt case of the case, any of those two, any case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4866.605" offset="19569768">You can’t take into account any pity or sympathy you might feel for this defendant no matter how down and obvious you have to decide the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4875.544" offset="19605504">Is he guilty of murder whatever might be robbery, you have to put pity and sympathy out of your mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="4882.193" offset="19632149">Now, if you’re trying a capital case and they’re given that instruction of a guilt plea then you have to correct that impression in the penalty face because they can’t properly be guided by such things in determining penalty in sentencing just like a trial judge can be take consideration or take these things into consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4903.358" offset="19716786">And unless it’s the position of the appellant, petitioner here, that pity and kindness and compassion should be excluded from the sentencing process and indeed must be excluded as a matter of constitutional law and it seems to me that he can’t prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="4923.156" offset="19795989">The Model Code certainly says nothing as I recall about kindness or compassion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4928.679" offset="19818036">No states to my knowledge has ever enacted standards of a kind that are suggested here, the ones that a Model Penal Code have been around for some time they have never been adopted by anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="4941.031" offset="19867460">This discretionary sentencing in capital cases has been with us just like as I pointed out earlier was at the instance of this Court some 70 years ago that the federal courts commenced this procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4955.704" offset="19926183">We’ve known about it, we haven’t been offended by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4958.025" offset="19935483">I think the results have been by enlarged, a vital large pretty good with undoubtedly they’re always arguable cases but no court has ever held that this is a constitutional defect in sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4975.082" offset="20003715">Only two years ago, this Court agreed to adhere to the decision in Williams against New York which in evaluating a sentencing procedures in New York in a capital case permitted the trial judge to consider matters in the probation report and other sources and it considered things that have not been testified to an open court so that in effect the defendant had no right to cross-examine.</text>
            <text syncTime="5006.276" offset="20128475">The witnesses that -- and the information sources of information that the trial judge considered and in that case, the trial judge in the face of a recommendation of a life sentence by the jury after reviewing these matters that came to him not from the witness stand that by way of reports imposed the death sentence in his good judgment, again without any standards as far as I can tell and this Court affirmed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5035.799" offset="20246549">And two years ago, in Patterson -- Specht against Patterson, you said, you’ve given it some thought that you adhered to that decision in Williams against New York and it seems to me they -- that of course the issues are different in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5050.098" offset="20303809">But that the sentencing procedure in Arkansas and the sentencing procedure in California and in the Federal Courts and everywhere in United States as far as I know that this aspect of the sentencing procedure does comport with due process of law and with equal protection of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="5069.821" offset="20382699">The -- there is no problem here in my judgment of undue vagueness in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5076.349" offset="20408717">Granted there are no standard specifically set forth but the definition of the crimes that calls for capital punishment, everywhere is very specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="5088.891" offset="20458977">Certainly, it’s in Arkansas it is in California those crimes are set forth whatever they might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="5094.659" offset="20481964">Whether in the first degree, rape, however the legislature wants to apply it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5100.758" offset="20506415">And the fact that the defendant doesn’t know and indeed no one knows and no one in this room knows whether if he undertakes a murder in the first degree, a jury will ultimately return a death sentence or a life sentence as one of those risks that he has to take in this life.</text>
            <text syncTime="5122.808" offset="20594604">He doesn’t know if Governor will grant him clemency.</text>
            <text syncTime="5125.082" offset="20603695">He doesn’t know if the District Attorney and whatever county happens to be in throughout the United States will ask for a death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5133.617" offset="20637863">He doesn’t even know what the higher Courts may rule in some things that might happen to him in the course of this procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5142.196" offset="20672136">Of course, he doesn’t know these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="5143.423" offset="20677047">But he knows this if he commits a murder in the first degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="5146.801" offset="20690526">He is subject to the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5149.344" offset="20700766">Now giving the jury the discretion to return a life sentence was the humanitarian step this Court has recognized that and in determining guilt, and there has to be this prior determination of guilt before we ever get around this sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5169.312" offset="20780596">The defendant has the benefit of all of the constitutional protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="5173.573" offset="20797628">We don’t see any unfairness in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5175.967" offset="20807241">We don’t see any uneven application of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5181.406" offset="20828975">The same rule is applicable to everybody that goes before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="5186.414" offset="20849037">Everybody who commits a murder in the first degree or rape in the State of Arkansas, they all have the same opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5193.930" offset="20879130">Be in fact they even have -- they have a better opportunity to seek a life sentence under the discretionary procedure than they would under any of these conceivable standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="5204.676" offset="20922075">Here the whole thing is wide open.</text>
            <text syncTime="5209.001" offset="20939421">Anything that a defense attorney can conceive of to say that might persuade a juror, mind you need a unanimous verdict in this cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5218.103" offset="20975783">Think of its one juror that there should be a life sentence why he’s accomplished the purpose and the only bounds are his own imagination and his own ingenuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5230.696" offset="21026147">Now again his status are going to limit that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5233.223" offset="21036283">There is another point here too, I think and I forgot to mention that in our discussion earlier about the California Procedure that it is clear in California that you -- the trial judge can on requests advice the jury about factors that they might consider and references made to the Model Penal Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="5256.240" offset="21128338">It would have to be made very clear to the jury that these were not controlling in any sense but if that were done, it would certainly, I think the jury could be told of those factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5271.380" offset="21188942">They can be told they can take kindness and so forth into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="5278.824" offset="21218617">So we submit that the mere absence of standards does not in any way make the Arkansas procedure for that reason unconstitutional if there other objections that we don’t share with Arkansas in terms of procedure, I’m sure the Attorney General form Arkansas was prepared to deal with those.</text>
            <text syncTime="5304.868" offset="21322794">I have just one closing remark, and that is I think that in light of your decision in Witherspoon wherein you recognize that under Illinois law the conscience of the community was focus on this man and what have you done.</text>
            <text syncTime="5324.495" offset="21401370">And there was no guide given to the jury and you insisted that that jury should be fairly composed and that was undisputed about whether that one was but nevertheless it would have to be fairly composed to reflect the conscience of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="5346.201" offset="21488201">That rule in Illinois, in the absence of standards is essentially the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5352.874" offset="21514846">You have to face an Arkansas on the same thing that we have in California and it seems to me that having recognized that and having -- making sure as you have made sure that the jury must be a fair representation of the community because you are invoke in their conscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="5375.980" offset="21607320">You're invoking their -- the qualities as I have referred to kindness, compassion, not simply an arid determination of facts but a real judgment in the -- and not on the legal sense but in the general sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="6128.763" offset="24618402">We think that the Arkansas, that the standards in Arkansas death cases our sit by the statute whenever in a rape case whenever the jury finds that a defendant has carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will that it can bring him the death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6150.576" offset="24705651">Those standards are the elements of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="6154.102" offset="24719757">Now in its mercy the jury can bring him life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6165.345" offset="24764792">But I would do want to emphasize that the made -- that the penalty actually is death and not life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6174.469" offset="24801259">And that appears that the Arkansas procedures sort of reverse from some of these others.</text>
            <text syncTime="6180.176" offset="24824038">In California, theirs is the ultimate but ours is the mandatory sentence of death but with the statute, the jury can its discretion recommend life imprisonment with the judge must abide by.</text>
            <text syncTime="6194.771" offset="24882448">Now in Arkansas, same when the crime of larceny which carries a penalty from 1 to 21 years, all that the jury has before them is the evidence in the definition of the elements of larceny and they can sit that punishment at any point in that extent of time they want to.</text>
            <text syncTime="6220.411" offset="24985057">There -- the prosecutor gets up there and argues that he ought to have 21 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="6225.485" offset="25005328">The defense gets up there and argues that he ought to get the minimum sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6230.180" offset="25024136">And the jury then sets it somewhere in between that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6237.493" offset="25053393">It appears from my reading of the federal statutes that there’s procedure in death sentences as the same as it is in Arkansas, that they have a unitary jury at one jury, and that they bring in the verdict of guilt and fix the punishment at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6259.197" offset="25140120">So what appears to us that if the Arkansas statutes are stricken down by this Court that the federal rule would also follow with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6273.402" offset="25196962">In this case and the transcript going back to the Witherspoon argument that the jury is the conscience of the community and that is a sort of a standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="6286.716" offset="25250252">The court’s instruction in number 2 on page 3 (a) of this transcript be among other things tells him that in reaching your verdict exercise your judgment, your common sense and reason in passing a bonus case and give the testimony of any and all witnesses such weight as you think it is entitled to and let your verdict be in accordance with the truth and the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="6598.766" offset="26498487">I would like to address three things if I may in rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6601.652" offset="26509981">One, the substantive arguments for the States of California and Arkansas, only very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="6609.983" offset="26543313">Two, the Witherspoon question in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6613.693" offset="26558151">And three, the point brought up by California as the differences between California and Arkansas procedure and the relevance of that for disposition of this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="6625.111" offset="26603813">My response on this substantive level can be, I think very brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6631.084" offset="26627741">As I understand that both California and Arkansas admit that we got an arbitrary procedure going here and they defended simply on the ground that it’s necessary, they can’t do anything else whether it’s beneficial to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="6646.161" offset="26688031">Both in reading the brief and in hearing the oral argument, I was struck that I heard this argument somewhere before.</text>
            <text syncTime="6652.362" offset="26712795">And so I look around I found it indeed, I have.</text>
            <text syncTime="6656.755" offset="26730350">This -- the argument that you have to allow arbitrary discretion so is to individualize on the facts of each individual cases, originally written by William Taylor in 1785.</text>
            <text syncTime="6672.116" offset="26791790">He was defending the English Bloody Code under which 250 crimes were capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="6679.188" offset="26820106">And he defended that on the ground that you couldn’t get a narrower formulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6683.933" offset="26839124">Just no way I which you could cut down on some of these crimes by fixing standards, taking somewhat might have been careful.</text>
            <text syncTime="6690.730" offset="26866291">He said, the preference for the English system of having a broad net in which he can make capital punishment available and then letting the Executive commute was in the consideration that the selection of proper objects for capital punishment depends principally upon circumstances which however easy to perceive in each particular case after the crime is committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6711.589" offset="26949778">It is impossible to enumerate or define before him and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="6715.871" offset="26966810">And he concluded eventually that the Law of England was based on the wise policy of sweeping into the net every crime which under any possible circumstances may marred the punishment of death and then letting individual circumstances furthered out and concluded that the wisdom and humanity of this design furnish a just excuse for the multiplicity of capital offenses which the Laws of England are accused to creating beyond those of other countries as the Bloody Code was justified.</text>

            <label>Mr. Anthony G. Amsterdam</label>
            <text syncTime="6793.879" offset="27278921">That’s correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="6795.995" offset="27287385">The only other thing I need to answer to this suggestion that the arbitrary discretion is justified by necessity or beneficence is that it makes an awful difference who you are being beneficent to.</text>
            <text syncTime="6808.799" offset="27338585">It might well be that you defendants might get a better shake.</text>
            <text syncTime="6811.981" offset="27351333">A lot of them would get more even handy justice and makes difference whether it was white or black defendants that you’re talking about in terms of whether this are good or bad system.</text>
            <text syncTime="6820.316" offset="27384665">But in any event I want to emphasize that our argument does not take discretion, compassion, or anything else out of the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="6826.746" offset="27410369">That is what Mr. Justice Fortas was talking about when he spoke about the next question or the next case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6832.120" offset="27431894">The question is whether standards can be devised which lead compassion in but narrow the range of discretion beyond what Arkansas allowed and our only contention here is that Arkansas has found the net too broadly and delimited to discretion too little.</text>
            <text syncTime="6845.922" offset="27487065">We do not contend for mandatory categories which we throw out wisdom and pity and compassion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6851.686" offset="27510157">We simply contend for rule of law that limits the application of the death penalty much more narrow that Arkansas does.</text>
            <text syncTime="6859.888" offset="27542967">Now the second thing I want to address myself to is Witherspoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="6865.542" offset="27565537">I hope that in looking at the transcript of -- what we argue in this case this Court will remember a number of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="6871.780" offset="27590510">First, Witherspoon has been generally cut to ribbons by the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="6876.153" offset="27607960">And I don’t think the court can likely assume --</text>

            <label>Mr. Anthony G. Amsterdam</label>
            <text syncTime="6883.229" offset="27636276">Not Arkansas Your Honor, by every Lower Court that I’ve seen decided Witherspoon case since Witherspoon earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="6888.688" offset="27658115">There are dozens of them pending on certiorari here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6892.923" offset="27675042">The kind of cutting the ribbons I’m talking about is that the lower courts (a) have eased up on the kind of opposition to the death penalty that permits exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6907.279" offset="27732511">Secondly, they have authorized exclusion where question is asked which the pretty good Witherspoon question but the answer is equivocal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6914.791" offset="27762500">They authorize exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6916.205" offset="27768142">Three, they read pre-Witherspoon records and saw they were done in light up Witherspoon assume that the jury is saying something that meets the Witherspoon testing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6925.781" offset="27806490">Go ahead and let him sit for a number of courts have held that if only a couple of jurors are thrown off under Witherspoon, it doesn’t make it bad as only a couple were here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6937.305" offset="27852570">Five, The courts have held that if the prosecutor’s remaining pre-emptor challenges exceed the number of juries in question that that sentence doesn’t get vacated under Witherspoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="6947.235" offset="27892276">I raised all these for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="6949.493" offset="27901367">This case has never had a Witherspoon claim at.</text>
            <text syncTime="6951.823" offset="27910666">The habeas petition was filed prior to Witherspoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="6955.160" offset="27924041">The District Court specifically since this is a second federal habeas corpus petition as whether there were other issues in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6961.937" offset="27951104">Witherspoon was never put in here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6963.510" offset="27957373">The court said, you know I’m going to be very weary about -- weary and wary about entertaining a third.</text>
            <text syncTime="6970.217" offset="27984227">I just wouldn’t simply assume that this case going to be settled or that Maxwell is going to stay alive for vindication of some Witherspoon claim and again I’m worried about the Witherspoon claims on this record in term unless this Court sets right.</text>
            <text syncTime="6984.522" offset="28041488">All of the developments of post-Witherspoon law which it made a very limited ruling indeed out of Witherspoon, more than that, Maxwell has been on death row in Arkansas since 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="6996.319" offset="28088613">He has twice come within a few days of his death, the last time to be saved only by a stay issued by Mr. Justice White of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7003.914" offset="28119019">What a lot of courts are doing in light of Witherspoon is the same, we vacate the death since we give them a new trial, new penalty trial now to determine whether he should live or die.</text>
            <text syncTime="7012.106" offset="28151829">It would be inhumanity second only to killing this man.</text>
            <text syncTime="7015.794" offset="28166562">Not to resolve the issue now finally presented whether the State of Arkansas has any right to be trying this man for his life under the unconstitutional procedures that we are challenging.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="7026.182" offset="28208149">I suppose you contemplated the possibility that a proscription of standards may result in more and not fewer death penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="7037.706" offset="28254229">Have you got a reaction on that, Mr. Amsterdam?</text>

            <text syncTime="7040.042" offset="28263528">I don’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="7041.280" offset="28268544">I think I have two reactions to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7045.239" offset="28284322">One, I doubt it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7046.481" offset="28289337">Depends on what standards they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="7048.724" offset="28298219">And it assumes, it assumes that our argument is an argument for mandatory categories which would take compassion out of the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="7057.025" offset="28331447">We don’t argue for that.</text>

            <text syncTime="7057.642" offset="28333955">I’m not -- that’s not what I have in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="7061.747" offset="28350360">But necessarily, there is a possibility in a way and the man may reasonably differ as to how important it is that proscribing standards for the imposition of the death penalty may result in more death penalties and would come about if the juries were just left free and do what they choose.</text>
            <text syncTime="7085.342" offset="28444714">And I assume you have considered that and that you've concluded that it’s not really relevant to legal argument that you make.</text>

            <text syncTime="7093.784" offset="28478464">I have Your Honor and I will add this.</text>
            <text syncTime="7096.446" offset="28489122">There are to the best of my knowledge, 475 men on death row at this moment in the country, 470 of them were sentence by juries exercising discretion akin to or in some way like Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="7115.026" offset="28563519">The decision in this case which we asked for would vacate or lay the ground for vacating.</text>
            <text syncTime="7125.174" offset="28604061">A number of death sentence as we contend are unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="7128.770" offset="28618480">The Governor of Arkansas has 14 men on death row whose executions he has held out pending disposition of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7135.845" offset="28646797">This Court has before it petitions for certiorari from Alabama, from New Jersey, from North Carolina, from California raising this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="7145.188" offset="28684100">I am very sensitive to the notion that this Court should not decide constitutional questions prematurely.</text>
            <text syncTime="7150.888" offset="28706879">But if eminent death of dozens of people can make an issue not premature, the issues presented here are not premature.</text>
            <text syncTime="7157.573" offset="28733628">There is no question of no adversity, there’s enough adversity in this case to float a dozen constitutional issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="7164.290" offset="28760482">There is not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="7164.889" offset="28762885">There’s no question here of an unfocused nature of the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="7168.879" offset="28778872">The issues are clearly focused and the question is presented for decision</text>
            <text syncTime="7172.718" offset="28794232">We suggest that for this Court to put up on speculation of Witherspoon or something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="7178.303" offset="28816593">The contention between this parties Arkansas contending he has a right to try William M. Maxwell and kill him without standards and are contending that for eight, the better part is six years.</text>
            <text syncTime="7192.661" offset="28874062">He’s been on death row and for longer than that under jeopardy of death under an unconstitutional regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="7198.188" offset="28896110">That’s the issue we put this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7199.706" offset="28902170">We ask this Court to decide the Arkansas procedure is unconstitutional for violation of the rule of law and we hope that it will reach and decide the issue in this case.</text>
