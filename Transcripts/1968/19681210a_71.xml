            <text syncTime="29.463" offset="221184">Yesterday, counsel for the petitioner, I had observed as I recall that the respondent churches had ceased to function.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.002" offset="251382">I think this was an attempt to bring the situation within that Section of the Book of Church Order and which has been identified, I think yesterday as Section 6-3.</text>

            <text syncTime="57.670" offset="334033">That refers to a situation in which we either have a church which has withered and died on the vine or one which is in the process of withering.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.406" offset="373008">Now, I -- the viability of these churches are, I think is manifested by the fact that these cases are before you today.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.157" offset="404041">Furthermore, if you examine the action of the administrative commission which the counsel made some imports, you will find, there was a completely innocuous act.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.879" offset="442911">What it did, it did more than -- did nothing more than accept the or recognize the cessation, you might say or removal of the session by their own volition and then it said in effect for those members of the congregation that still wish to worship, we will furnish you a minister.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.241" offset="524309">So, as to the question of im -- whether these judges should have appealed the action of the administrative commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.165" offset="551999">There were two reasons I didn't have to.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.471" offset="561298">First, under the guard of the First Amendment, these people individually or collected really have the right to withdraw.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.070" offset="587630">Second, the constitution of the Presbyterian church has no prohibition against a church taking this action and this too is in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1634.135" offset="6639888">And here's what the four points that they raised, they said that federal question was raised in the Supreme Court of Georgia on a motion for rehearing and that that many questions thrust before that court were entertained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.847" offset="6694745">The federal question was -- the motion was entertained and the many federal questions presented were answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.932" offset="6715120">That is not the record in the writing and it of course, this violates the historic position of this Court that on a motion for rehearing when the federal question is raised for the first time, you must entertain and decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.224" offset="6764231">The other question was that in overruling Matt v. Kahn (ph) it violated the rule of stare decisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.251" offset="6788368">This is -- again this Georgia Court has adopted the federal rule and that you do not have a vested right in a prior decision and the Supreme Court of Georgia so ruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.132" offset="6827865">Looking again at the other, that the overruling Matt versus Kahn (ph) violated the First and Fourteenth Amendment application of Watson versus Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.058" offset="6867571">This is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.299" offset="6876557">Matt versus Kahn (ph) specifically stated that on a proper showing of a complete abandonment of the dogma and doctrine that the court would then protect the rights of the local property, local church who were adhering to the dogma and discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.090" offset="6943744">So this comes as absolutely no surprise there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.944" offset="6955133">All the Supreme Court of Georgia did was to modify its substantive law which had had the right to do any change, the complete task to that of -- substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.357" offset="6992750">And finally, they contend that the federal question was properly raised on the local at the initial level in the trial court by the general allegation that the -- this act that they -- act in appropriating the property would violate it, the laws of the United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.059" offset="7063594">This lack -- they require specificity of the state court and also the federal court and there was no motion or other appropriate action taken in the trial court to bring this federal question to the state court and thus to this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1924.270" offset="7800456">I think in this question of property, we must consider that the Presbyterian Church is a great church composed of many thousands of people who have joined it over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.941" offset="7847163">These local churches, when they joined, when they have became members of the Presbyterian Church in this great volume, the church, when they joined it, they placed their property under the polity and control of this church and therefore, they didn't have to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.960" offset="7919261">They could've remained the congregational church.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.966" offset="7931277">They could've kept their property but for -- because they wanted to do just as I did and I happen to be a Presbyterian.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.524" offset="7961475">The justice I did when I joined that church, I put myself under the polity and control of the church and therefore these local churches did it with their property at that time and all these churches -- all that the Savannah Presbyterians has asked to do is to put a minister who is a Presbyterian minister because these churches no longer have Presbyterian members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.544" offset="8061576">They renounced the church and withdrew from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.729" offset="8074324">All they asked to do is to put a Presbyterian minister in the church to hold services for any members of this church who might want to come and while the vote was unanimous about those who were there, I think the court will take judicial cognizance at the very few churches that have all the members their at any one given day.</text>

            <text syncTime="2028.041" offset="8215489">And if there was only one member of that church who wanted the Presbyterian services yield in it, I say he had a right under the constitution and the law to have that service alive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.038" offset="8267525">We think Watson versus Jones and Kedroff have decided ever issue in the -- this case in favor of the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.222" offset="8300231">We think Watson versus Jones and this case are very similar on the facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2057.054" offset="8331577">Watson involved the statement by the church on the question of slavery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.411" offset="8349027">This case involved the statement of the church on civil rights because the evidence is that the witness for the plaintiffs said that was the main reason that they withdrew and in each case the state sought to try ecclesiastical issues in the civil courts which this Court said could not be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.099" offset="8447770">The churches in this country have lived under Watson versus Jones for a hundred years and with Kedroff for 15 years with no injury to our religious life.</text>
