            <text syncTime="13.873" offset="158908">Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.300" offset="172596">This is a case involving the right of an indigent California prisoner to a free transcript of his hearing out of petition for habeas corpus in the California Superior Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.595" offset="221706">That petitioner alleged insufficient access to legal materials and to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.193" offset="248142">The issue in this case is whether under the facts of the case, petitioner can obtain an adequate appellate review consistent with due process and equal protection under the California habeas corpus procedures where a non-indigent prisoner could have purchased this transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.678" offset="326092">But the appellate procedures in California relating to habeas corpus cases are not conditioned as a matter of law on the availability of that transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.412" offset="373008">Following the hearing, the Superior Court denied the petitioners petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.070" offset="399653">Petitioner then filed a written motion for a free transcript alleging his lack of funds, his need for the transcript to prove his case claims in the California Supreme Court and to assist him in the preparation of his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.569" offset="453674">Petitioner did not then and does not now complain about the hearing, but instead contends the evidence will prove his habeas corpus contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.461" offset="493171">Petitioner in his motion raised the federal questions presented here citing authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.123" offset="511875">The Superior Court denied that motion by written order stating among other things that none of the proceedings in that court would be of concern to the California Appellate Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.932" offset="555133">Petitioner sought review of that denial of his motion for a free transcript by petitioning for writ of certiorari in the California Court of Appeal, which was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.991" offset="591287">Petitioner then sought a hearing in the California Supreme Court which was denied. Both of those denials were without opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.656" offset="622007">Petitioner then petitioned this court for a writ of certiorari, which was granted after a response was filed by the State of California upon request.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.789" offset="654503">This court then appointed counsel, the only time the petitioner has been represented in these proceedings by counsel except at the hearing on his petition for the writ of habeas corpus in the California Superior Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.102" offset="707793">It is a transcript of that hearing for the purpose of presenting his contentions for habeas corpus to the California Appellate Courts, this Court and if necessary the lower federal courts that petitioner is here seeking.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.998" offset="767352">It seems clear under various decisions of this Court most recent prominent one of which is Long versus District Court 385 U.S. 192 that if the Californian habeas corpus procedure was a traditional appellate procedure, equal protection would require that this transcript be furnished to petitioner so that he could have the same means of pursuing his remedies as man with means to purchase the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.013" offset="883440">The difference if any, in this case is that habeas corpus in California is termed as a theoretical matter to be an original writ procedure in each of the court's of California and theoretically --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="210.512" offset="945403">You say that is theoretical, that is fact; isn't it; in other words and it works.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.392" offset="972988">It may work to the benefit of the applicant because if this is not an appeal but rather an original new application for habeas corpus in the second court then the applicant is free to bring in additional material, which he would not normally be free to do, if this were simply a review of the District Court action.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles E. Rickershauser, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="239.120" offset="1059819">That is true Mr. Justice Stewart but in practice it seems to me we have to look at the California procedure and see how it usually works and I think we will see that is very much like an appellate procedure in the usual case and of course even if it isn't I think the petitioner has shown his need for that transcript to prepare for the appellate court review, but if I might I'd like to point out that even though the petitioner is theoretically able to proceed and either the Superior Court or the Appellate Courts of California in an original proceedings, as a general matter and the usual practice as established in the State's brief here as referred to, is that the Appellate Courts will require him to start in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.542" offset="1233586">So the next aspect --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="290.576" offset="1265664">Where I think I'm right in saying that under the statute an original writ of habeas corpus could be brought either to Federal District Court or before a Circuit Judge or the whole Court of Appeals or before any Justice or before this whole Court, but the practice is that it's authorized by the statute of Federal system to transfer any such applications filed in the particular Circuit Judges or Supreme Court Justices to transfer it to the District Court, is that more or less the California practice?</text>

            <text syncTime="326.111" offset="1407770">I believe the more common practice is to deny the application for habeas corpus, it's referred to a footnote in the State's brief on the ground that he should proceed in the trial court, absent some unusual circumstances of the trial court would not act.</text>

            <text syncTime="343.152" offset="1476002">Of course in the Federal system, there is provision for appeals from denials of habeas corpus and as I understand it in California there's no appeal from a denial.</text>

            <text syncTime="362.447" offset="1553115">However, in many times the subsequent proceedings in the Appellate Court have the same effect as an appeal, because the Appellate Courts often limit their review to the record before the trial court and that is all that was asked here since there was no complaint about the hearing in the trial court or that it was insufficient or that additional evidence would be required in the Appellate Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="719.113" offset="2979819">He then came here for a writ of certiorari which was granted. Direct to the Superior Court of California although we have treated it in our brief as directed to the Supreme Court, I think it would apply to either case, either court.</text>

            <text syncTime="792.118" offset="3271868">We do not ask this court to say that California in fact has an appellate remedy; we're just showing that it has some of the same aspects and is therefore makes the need for this transcript even greater under those circumstances, and it is not always the tradition to grant separate hearings to consider these records separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.696" offset="3354206">I think the basic considerations underlying the transcript cases, which are that an indigent prisoner is to be afforded an adequate means of review in the appellate courts as a man with means, require the furnishing of this transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.965" offset="3419199">It seems to us that the facts of this case uniquely demonstrate the essential aspect of this transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.631" offset="3453889">This petitioner in his habeas corpus petition is asking, is claiming that he is denied access to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.080" offset="3479698">This is obviously a problem with complexity in which the courts must weigh his liberty and his rights against the right of the institutional authorities to run the prison, a complex problem and it is exceedingly -- it is almost unbelievable that a man who had means would not purchase the transcript of this hearing in the trial court in order to assist him in the preparation of his papers in the appellate courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.249" offset="3612400">And also to demonstrate to the appellate courts how it is that he was denied access to, which would certainly be of assistance to a court in determining whether or not there was the kind of denial of access that would be a deprivation of his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.959" offset="3683244">It is our view therefore that there is that kind of invidious discrimination between the prisoner of means and the prisoner without means that the transcript cases have discussed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1584.855" offset="6442820">Permit me to begin by attempting to distinguish Long versus District Court of Iowa and to explain something of our California procedures in the process of doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.892" offset="6486915">The obvious distinction between Long and the situation here is that California does have habeas corpus and Iowa had an appeal procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.976" offset="6527248">However permit me to emphasize the significance of that difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.421" offset="6549086">When you have an appeal although it is possible to hear the matter on a clerk's transcript, in the ordinary case, the focus is on the trial court below, the proceedings there, and the reporter's transcript of those proceeding and --</text>

            <text syncTime="1635.820" offset="6646680">And the focus of the court is to review the proceedings below to determine whether or not there was error and in order to do that you look at the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.922" offset="6683042">However in California we have an entirely different procedure where the proceedings below are entirely tangential and collateral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.394" offset="6720972">There the court doesn't necessarily review the proceeding below, it receives allegations from the petitioner and it tests those allegations to determine their sufficiency and because of that, because the court relies on allegations it does not necessarily need a transcript to resolve the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.269" offset="6812400">There is another aspect of this difference also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.095" offset="6827760">The habeas corpus procedure has multiple stages, the first stage is a pleading stage, after that the court gets into the process of determining the truth of the allegations that it has not denied the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.630" offset="6885857">Thus in this initial stage, the court does not require proof, it does not require evidence, it does not require a procedure for submitting the matter in any particular way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.811" offset="6938624">It can proceed to determine the sufficiency of the allegations just by reading the allegations and this is the normal, the meaningful and the usual way to proceed in habeas corpus matters.</text>
