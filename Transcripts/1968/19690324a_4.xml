            <label>Mr. Ronald Butler</label>
            <text syncTime="26.879" offset="210840">Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors, this is an appeal from a permanent injunctive order issued by a three-judge court in Northern District of Illinois which order for purposes of this appeal held unconstitutional one sub-section of the Illinois intimidation statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.753" offset="290356">Illinois Revised Statutes, Chapter 38, Section 12-6 (a) (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="52.627" offset="313866">Jurisdiction is conferred upon this Court by a Title 28, Section 1253 and 2281.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.734" offset="346258">Probable jurisdiction was noted on the 9th of December 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.825" offset="362663">The posture of this case in the lower court is as follows: A complaint was filed by the plaintiffs purported alleging a conspiracy to violate the plaintiffs' constitutional right and setting forth that by the use of unconstitutional statutes on their face or statute or the misuse of statutes which would be otherwise constitutional that the plaintiff's' constitutional rights were violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.289" offset="460570">The defendants' filed a motion to dismiss initially alleging four basic grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.849" offset="478751">First, lack of jurisdiction, second, no relief upon which your claim can be granted, third, as to those sub-classifications of plaintiffs who had been arrested prior to the filing of the complaint for federal equitable jurisdiction the bar of 28 U.S.C. 2283.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.447" offset="553148">And lastly, as to those class of plaintiffs who had not been arrested but who were plaintiffs in the case the claim that the lack of specificity in the complaint takes jurisdiction away from the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.231" offset="608319">The single trial judge dismissed the motion to dismiss filed by the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.087" offset="627754">In doing so, he stated that the plaintiffs did have proper standing that the question of 2283 was a premature question because that statute was not jurisdictional that a three-judge court would be convened and the first order of business upon convening the three-judge court would be to determine the threshold question of constitutionality with respect to the five enumerated statutes which the plaintiffs have challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.652" offset="734020">The appellants thereby filed an answer, denying the material allegations of the complaint and specifically in an affirmative series of affirmative defenses setting forth those statements which we made in a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.961" offset="791176">Now, the statue in question reads as follows: a person commits intimidation when with intent to cause another to perform or to omit the performance of an act he communicates to another a threat to perform without lawful authority anyone of the following acts in sub-section 3 commit a criminal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.546" offset="893576">The lower court held that the statute in question was overbroad because it prohibited insubstantial evil.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.486" offset="925341">They said that the commission of offenses against public order only is not such a substantial evil that the state may prohibit the threat of it and they further stated that the prohibition of insubstantial evil is outweighed by legitimate political discussion on a wide birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.239" offset="1004335">There are two issues presented for review in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.396" offset="1016978">One, whether the plaintiffs have sufficient requisites standing to entitle them to determination of the constitutionality of the intimidation statute and two, if they do have such standing whether the First Amendment prohibition against the abridgement of speech is violated by a state statute which prohibits threats to commit a criminal offense where the intention is to force another to surrender his freedom of choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.540" offset="1129514">Now, as to the standing point, the complaint shows the constitutional validity of five Illinois statutes: the map violating statute, resisting arrest, aggravated assault, aggravated battery, and intimidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.332" offset="1184684">There are seven sub-classes of plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.040" offset="1195551">Six of the sub-classes have been arrested in incidents prior to the filing of the federal declaratory complaint and whose cases were presently pending at the time that the federal declaratory suit was filed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="286.589" stopTime="289.680">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="286.589" offset="1249677">What are the -- were any of those suits under the intimidation statute?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ronald_butler" startTime="289.680" stopTime="437.929">
            <label>Mr. Ronald Butler</label>
            <text syncTime="289.680" offset="1262111">None were under the intimidation statute, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.001" offset="1279352">Now, as far as the complainants who were not arrested but who were party's plaintiff, the complaint is the appellants' view it show no specificity with respect to the -- with respect to any factual allegations which can be shown to depict a depravation of constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.217" offset="1364198">In my view, reading the 37 paragraph complaint there are six paragraphs which have anything at all to do with the intimidation statute and with the sub-classification of the plaintiffs who have challenged the statute under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.219" offset="1420204">That was paragraphs 8, 24, and 25, paragraphs 34, 37 (b) and 37 (f) but in each of those six paragraphs, the complaint is devoid of any specificity effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.468" offset="1477256">All we see are conclusory allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.942" offset="1495124">I am intimidated because of the intimidation statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.703" offset="1518216">Now, the purported foundation for this case lies in two cases, Dombrowski versus Pfister and Zwickler versus Koota but in both of those cases, Your Honors, there were specificity effects at least in Dombrowski there were affidavits filed, there were offers of proof made in both Dombrowski and in Zwickler.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.675" offset="1598046">We have situations where there were prior arrests even though the arrests were not pending at the time of the federal declaratory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.474" offset="1625318">And lastly, there was in the complaint a specific contention shown by the defendants to future arrest, to future violation of the plaintiffs' constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.259" offset="1672443">I submit that this case does not fall within the precept of Dombrowski and Zwickler but rather falls with the concept of DuBois versus Clark and the recent case of Golden versus Zwickler.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.637" offset="1721971">In DuBois, this Court declined to hear a situation where they said that the -- were just this Court said that the no specificity at all is shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.194" offset="1764185">In Golden versus Zwickler, we had a situation where the Court stated that the complaint failed to present probably because of the specificity -- lack of specificity of the complaint fail to present an actual case or controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.227" offset="1824266">It is our opinion that the present complaint fails both to shows specificity or to show an actual case or controversy.</text>

            <text syncTime="437.929" offset="1855091">Now, is the situation different at the time of the judgment you were calling Golden and we felt that the three-judge court had erred in making this determination of case of controversy on the allegations alone rather than on the situation as it's existed at the time of the remain?</text>

            <text syncTime="489.579" offset="2061667">Unless this Court is prepared to allow that much more wide of latitude than it seemed that the intendment of Dombrowski was designed to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.030" offset="2095522">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.457" offset="2105240">Secondly, as to the issue on the merits, the appellants contend that a statute which prohibits threats to commit a criminal offense where the threats are intended to force another, to surrender their freedom of choice is not within the purview of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.678" offset="2170128">We contend this upon two factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.203" offset="2180159">First, in analysis of the thrust of the statute; and secondly the scope of the First Amendment with respect to threaten conduct where the intention is to force another to surrender their freedom of choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.122" offset="2231881">The lower court in this case in a very fine opinion found that the intimidation statute as a whole was designed to protect communications intended to compel another to act against his will.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.622" offset="2285902">The Court defined a threat then and they said a threat was an expression of an intention to inflict harm or evil against another.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.339" offset="2316727">They said that it was more than a mere intention however that it was a menace that it must unsettle the mind of the person on whom it operates and then it must take away from his acts that free and voluntary choice which would alone constitute consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.881" offset="2374928">They set further that the expression of that threat must have a reasonable tendency to be carried out by the threatener according to its tenor.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.361" offset="2416828">This is the definition of threat, this is a definition we abide by now yet when the lower court approach to sub-section involved it shifted its emphasis from the substantiality of the threat to the substantiality of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.629" offset="2481925">This, we feel is what precipitated the error in the lower court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.801" offset="2502614">The lower court itself stated earlier that the substantiality of the crime was not really the important thing because they said that a mere expression of intent to commit a criminal act was not itself sufficient under the statute that we need the final element of extortion which completes the prohibited act, which is the taking away of that free and voluntary action which alone constitutes consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.931" offset="2603133">So the substantiality of the evil must go to the threat and to the fear committed by that threat as far as the object of the threat is concerned, the victim, and not to the substantiality or the insubstantiality of the crime threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.785" offset="2666559">The Court made three illustrations to justify proposed -- their proposed opinion and the three illustrations were the following: a group of dissidents who asked for certain things or will commit disorderly conduct, people in a high crime neighborhood who asked for more police protection are failing to get a threat and to carry conceal weapons, and finally, group of mothers who threatened to block a highway should they not get a traffic regulatory signal.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.630" offset="2805844">And the lower court was of the opinion that since those crimes that they threaten was so insubstantial when measured against legitimate political discussion on a wide birth that the First Amendment should then protect those statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.406" offset="2877001">In those examples, the Court in looking to the crime threat failed to observe the main purpose in spirit of the statute toward the person threatened.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.762" offset="2934471">The substantiality of the threat could be great and the substantiality of the crime need not be great, need be insignificant and can be insignificant.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.171" offset="2984103">One example of this would be a threat by an individual to burn two pieces of lumber placed together in the form of a cross in an open field next to a school which is to be integrated the next day.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.391" offset="3044916">A situation involving a substantial threat, but yet of an insubstantial crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.851" offset="3074800">A further example individuals on a campus who approach the chancellor and tell the chancellor that unless their demands are met within five days, that they are going to disrupt classes, that they are going to take over his office, they're not going to threaten him personally or physically, they're not going to destroy the building but they're just going to make it impossible for the school to function.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.315" offset="3172603">This would be a situation where the threat would be very substantial but yet the crime might be nothing more than disorderly conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.619" offset="3209801">It is appellant's contention that this type of examples along with the example cited by the lower court which fall within the purview in concept to this statute and that the statute is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.022" offset="3259434">In essence then with the lower court seems to be saying is that the threat of an insignificant crime when they said that the threat of an insignificant crime should not be punished, they are really saying that a little bit of illegality is not so bad and can be protected by the First Amendment so long as speech is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.333" offset="3336756">In examining this issue in the light of First Amendment protections, it doesn't seem to meet the category of the First Amendment preserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.736" offset="3382314">An extortion by threat is not the advocacy of ideas, it's not the teaching of ideas and it's not the exposition of ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.454" offset="3413138">It's not legitimate political discussion on a wide birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.160" offset="3439992">The entire history of the cases of this Court from Baldwin versus Robertson in 1896, to the statement made in Carroll versus President and Board of Commissioners of Saint Anne's County late last year seem to indicate that speech uttered in a context of violence or speech uttered to follow an illegal course of conduct are not prohibited -- are prohibited rather by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.784" offset="3542497">The First Amendment should not protect that type of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.888" offset="3558902">And on our brief on page 18 and 19, we have set forth a myriad of cases respecting this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.698" offset="3594115">I should just like to mention a few.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.559" offset="3605608">In Bridges versus California where this Court a contempt case where this Court reversed the contempt conviction, this Court was very clear to point out that under no construction therefore and I'm quoting directly, “under no construction therefore, can we take the telegram of Bridges to be a threat to follow an illegal course of conduct?”</text>

            <label>Mr. Ellis E. Reid</label>
            <text syncTime="1432.768" offset="5834480">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.959" offset="5847228">Basically, to begin I'd like to point out and quote from the page 8 of my brief “legitimate political expression intended to secure changes in society's legal, political, social, or economic structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.668" offset="5930088">Frequently, takes the form of expressions about future events or conditions such expression may be in the form of promises, predictions, or warnings, or threats of an unlawful -- threats of lawful action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.605" offset="5989752">Now, apparently the basis of this appeal is that the court below deemed it inappropriate to circumscribe a threat of miniscule illegal activity but what we have here is really a collision between the right of certain individuals in this society to exercise what has been historical and classical First Amendment freedoms and the right of a state to protect itself and to protect the order of liberty which -- without which we would not have any freedom of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.086" offset="6139695">So, we've always -- we always do have a conflict in this area and this Court has in many -- on many occasions try to resolve a conflict but now we have a statute before this Court which the state contends is an extortion statute in the classic sense, it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.161" offset="6215973">This statute does not require the defendant to take or to attempt to take anything of value from the purported victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.209" offset="6260172">I say it's not an extortion statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.394" offset="6272920">It is overbroad and extortion statute could've been drawn to protect a state against that evil and in fact, you have Section (a) (1) of that statute which is not here on appeal and which would remain valid which says of course the threat of inflicting physical harm on the person threatened or any other person or on property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.407" offset="6364975">Now, if they want to protect people from extortion, I say well, in good the state has an interest in that which is substantial but when you deal with what they term as the right of a public official to have freedom of choice, I say you made the statute so broad as to really put a five year news or a $5,000.00 fine around anyone's neck would have it to merit to publicly utter that we will march around Mayor Daley's house and violate let's say an ordinance which would maybe cause us to pay a hundred dollar fine at the most.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.940" offset="6539160">Now, we must face five years in the penitentiary or pay a forfeit $5,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.474" offset="6561311">This is the real guts of this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.270" offset="6580433">The statute also makes criminal the threat to commit a criminal offense without regard to the degree of the threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.438" offset="6617109">This is the point I'm making.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.125" offset="6623901">In other words, if you carry out the threat in its final analysis and its one to violate a misdemeanor and it will be punishable only by fine, why then when you take it one step back and say, I'm going to do this tomorrow?</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.367" offset="6692864">Now, you face five years in the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.995" offset="6707388">I suggest to you that this is the reason that the court below struck this particular portion of this statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1701.832" offset="6910725">So I'm saying that this statute when you take just historical direct action protest it elevates what has been the exposure of using misdemeanors and punishment by fine or short detention to the area of a felony and I think that it puts a chill on legitimate free expression of ideas and a chill on the right of individuals to determine that they will do something in a way to bring about legitimate change.</text>

            <text syncTime="2916.941" offset="11771173">Well, the real problem it's not merely matter amuses me but it sort of highlights the real what is a real problem in this case to me which is whether you can go through a statute book and without any specific or explicit basis and threats of enforcement you say against you whether you can just go through a statute book and pick out statutes that might conceivably be used by the police and a civil rights demonstration and then bring an action based on Dombrowski seeking relief or whether you've got to have a specific basis and specific threats, specific harassment, specific action taken under a specific statute before you can utilize Dombrowski.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.390" offset="12008887">That's the issue here and this long list is merely a humorous illustration of a kind of intellectual problem and legal problem that I suspect is very real in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2992.445" offset="12073148">Well, I would ask the Court to reach a middle ground from what you've said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.173" offset="12096031">I think there is a point in between those two poles, in other words, I would agree this Court should not sit to hear contrive not substantial litigation where one would go to a statute book and dig them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.875" offset="12158830">But I think also we should not in the area of the First Amendment freedoms and this is why I think this is unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.041" offset="12183489">And this I think is the reason for Dombrowski, wait until someone has been tried and convicted before they would have standing before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.433" offset="12213060">I think that this particular case presents a factual circumstance of that middle ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.122" offset="12239809">There was a scheme that was entered into and upon where we were arrest, where we were intimidated, where we were thrown into jail with high bonds and where there were meetings and where the police prosecutors start going to the statute book and we heard about it and we got to Court before they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.872" offset="12322879">Now, I don't think that we lose our standing by beating them to Court and that's what the issue I'm trying to impress upon this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3193.274" offset="12876466">That's deal with the total problem now because they now or threaten now used mob-action in disorderly conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.411" offset="12904991">They have threatening to use intimidation too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.822" offset="12918680">So, we therefore put it in as part and parcel of this complaint and therefore I feel that the court below had jurisdiction and I feel that as I stand here now, I have standing to sue and to the right to attack the intimidation statute also as well as the ones that we've attacked below with proper standing and I'd say well, with no allegation below that we did not have proper standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.891" offset="13026931">Basically, for those reasons I'd like to urge that the Court affirmed the court below because unless we have a basis for dealing with these matters with in the framer of the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.954" offset="13075205">All of those things which they urged about taking to the streets in a righteous way may come to pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.591" offset="13101746">And I would suggest that when we tighten the news around people's neck and it become frustrated.</text>
