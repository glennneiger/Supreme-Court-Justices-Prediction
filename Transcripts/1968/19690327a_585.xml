            <text syncTime="7.357" offset="132786">Mr. Wallace, you may continue with your argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="11.663" stopTime="802.546">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="11.663" offset="150026">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.497" offset="165386">I said yesterday that Section 8 (a) (1) of the Labor Act when read together with Section 8 (c) prohibits the employer from coercively interfering by threat of reprisal with employee free choice and selecting a bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.439" offset="249083">Now, of course, Congress never said in the Act or in its legislative history that the threat of reprisal need be in any particular form of words or that it need be confined within the compass of a single communication in order to be an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.451" offset="333197">Congress was concerned with substantial rights and did not create any such loopholes in this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.660" offset="369977">Now, in this case, we are not dealing with an employer who was so ill-advised as to threaten his employees in blatant, unequivocal terms, but the Board also has a responsibility in protecting the rights that Congress has guaranteed to determine whether an employer who is carefully avoided the utterance of any specific overt threat has nevertheless intimidated his employees by getting the message across in the totality of what is said that there is a real threat of company reprisal if they should select the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.821" offset="558686">In assessing whether the employer's communications where calculated to have that effect and more importantly, whether they were likely to be understood by the employees of such a threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.559" offset="617618">The Board of course tries realistically to take into account all the circumstances including any factors that may make the employees especially susceptible to employer intimidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.041" offset="687522">As Judge Hays of the Second Circuit who was a longtime and distinguished scholar of labor law has suggested in a dissenting opinion, it is not always easy for those of us who are in a profession which shows no signs of obsolescence and which offers a wide variety of employment flexibility to appreciate that the insecurities of workers who are not so fortunately situated can make them painfully vulnerable to the pressures of equivocal or veiled threats by their employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.492" offset="873305">Now, one additional word of background may be illuminating before turning to this record, the particular kind of threat involved in this case, the threat of plant closure has long been recognized as one of the most flagrantly coercive and destructive of employee free choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.908" offset="967032">In one of the leading opinions in this entire field, Franks Brothers against the Labor Board in Volume 321 U.S. in a unanimous opinion delivered by Mr. Justice Black, the Court singled plant closure offers special emphasis in the following language.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.147" offset="1067969">Before the election was held, petitioner conducted an aggressive campaign against the union even to the extent of threatening to close its factory if the union won the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.365" offset="1144874">Now, part of the record which the Board was dealing within this case is cogently summarized I believe in the petitioner's brief and I'd like to read a few short sentences at the bottom of the page 5 and top of page 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.339" offset="1216763">During this same period, 1952 to 1965, changes were made in weaving industry equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.068" offset="1255633">The company's looms were automated to the point where they could be run without an operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.089" offset="1279770">Electric clutches and fingers were added, which made it much easier to operate and some skills formerly needed were eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.945" offset="1327104">Although it was not unusual to have apprentices in 1952, the situation changed in the industry after that time because of automation.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.529" offset="1369527">The company had had no apprentices since 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.269" offset="1400456">The question then was whether the employer's communications to this group of employees whose skills had become technologically outmoded to a substantial degree were likely to have had a coercive effect by conveying a threat of reprisal.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.629" offset="1481853">Now, the Board relied on the purported effect of these communications as a whole rather than on any particular statements and they are rather diffusively spread over the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.461" offset="1537233">It's difficult to present in the course of an oral argument, the communications as a whole, but I'll attempt to make a quick survey of them relying upon the Board's findings in its opinion at first in the distillation that it made of these communications from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.712" offset="1630229">If I can begin as background with the earlier communications starting on page 172 of the appendix in the findings and they were findings in the Board's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.831" offset="1690728">In the first speech made to all of the employees when the president of the company first learned of the union's organizing campaign long before any demand for recognition had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.490" offset="1749347">He spoke towards the bottom of page 172 of the company's financial condition indicating that ever since the last strike, the shop had been running on thin ice.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.247" offset="1796368">He emphasized that if the company could not agree to the union's demands, the union's only weapon is a strike and pointed out that while he did not intend to close, a strike could lead to the closing of the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.993" offset="1847359">He also told the group that the wire weavers craft was a small one that it would be difficult for them to find other jobs because it was not like finding a job as a machinist that many of them did not have the education which would make it difficult for them to find another job and that many of them were getting too old to go out and find new jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.076" offset="1947669">Continuing on page 174, he said that he did not think the Lindsay organization, the new owners was going to be concerned if through contract negotiations with the union, our people went on strike, that the strike could close respondent's plant and nothing would prevent Lindsay from having respondent's weaving worked on at Lindsay's plant in Ohio and Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.162" offset="2056025">He also stated the respondent was subject to foreign competition and that it was conceivable that if the plant was closed under any circumstances, that some of the work would go to foreign companies and that respondent had handled foreign wires in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.068" offset="2115688">He pointed out that all they had to do was to look around Holyoke if they thought a strike could not close respondent's plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.947" offset="2151111">Now, continuing with a letter sent on November 5th to all of the employees on page 175, in the text of this letter, he said, that the new ownership is entrusted in profits and not pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.671" offset="2238046">They have no ties with Holyoke or Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.509" offset="2257377">Skipping down, “The union promises you a lot but what can they deliver except pressure, the threat of a strike.”</text>
            <text syncTime="547.276" offset="2292485">He then stated that, “I do not believe the threat of a strike will cause the new owners any loss of sleep.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.229" offset="2316309">However, a long strike would be bad for me because I would like to remain in Holyoke.”</text>
            <text syncTime="559.179" offset="2340133">Next, I'd like to turn to page 178 in these findings, getting into the period within 30 days before the election upon which the Board directly rely and a letter of November 30th addressed to all of the wire weavers, I'm reading from page 178, the third line.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.442" offset="2437099">This letter warns that, “A strike can still close the Holyoke plant, but other plants can pick up the work, and that the new ownership is entrusted in profits and not pressure.”</text>
            <text syncTime="596.398" offset="2488926">He then points out that the Teamsters Union cannot do anything to improve our profit position, but can only make big demands which the company cannot meet, and the call you out on strike because a strike is a union's only weapon to enforce its big demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.413" offset="2557053">He then asks, “Can you afford a long strike when you know the Holyoke plant has been given a second chance to stay in the business and furnish jobs for all of us?”</text>
            <text syncTime="626.018" offset="2607417">Now, I would like to turn directly to the employer's last communications during the two days before the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.164" offset="2643989">First of all, a leaflet which was distributed to the wire weavers two days before the election in which appears on page 137 of the appendix in a foldout, it begins you'll note on page 137 of the appendix with a cartoon showing a grave being prepared for the Sinclair Company, surrounded by tombstones marked with the names of other companies in the area that had closed down.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.130" offset="2803858">And underneath the cartoon, among the comments is the statement, the Holyoke-Springfield Industrial graveyard is filled with companies which died under union pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.737" offset="2862268">And then on the next page, on the reverse side, in the first column under the heading, many were sick when the union doctor came in, it says, “Some of the industrial corpses were already sick when the unions came in with big promises to the employees of what the unions could do for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.937" offset="2947114">These companies needed higher production and better quality to meet the stiffer competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.269" offset="2968430">The union doctors gave them bloodletting strikes restricted production and a higher labor cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.620" offset="2997896">The result as you see as you look around was the death of these companies.”</text>
            <text syncTime="731.268" offset="3028407">Then on the following page which continues the leaflet, page 139, under the caption our history is not bright against the background such as ours, your dreams of union miracles can be dangerous to your real job security.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.990" offset="3107297">We don't know what the future holds for any of us, but you can be sure the new owners of Sinclair Company were looking for profits and not operation Holyoke rat hole into which to pour dollars without hope of profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.625" offset="3165915">And then the final page, pictures five factories in the area which have closed down with the -- among the captions, unions furnished no job security here.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.177" offset="3220041">In testimony however, on pages 40 and 41 of the appendix, the employer admitted that he had no basis for believing that unions or union activities had had anything to do with the closing of any of these plants, despite the representations in this leaflet.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="808.426" offset="3337070">There had been a union prior to 1952, an independent union which is now affiliated with the Teamsters and Wire Weaving Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.281" offset="3376462">There had been a 13-week strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.995" offset="3387329">After which, the plant reopened on a non-union basis until this present controversy in 1965.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="832.472" stopTime="836.474">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="832.472" offset="3433305">That was before the new management?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="836.474" stopTime="1140.664">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="836.474" offset="3449292">That was before the -- a company was sold to Lindsay Wire Weaving, but the president of Sinclair, the wholly-owned subsidiary is the same man who is the manager when it was an independent company.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.962" offset="3495267">It's the son of the founder.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.794" offset="3506552">Now, finally, I would like to turn to the note cards introduced into evidence by the company which were the basis of the final speech to the wire weavers on the day before the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.562" offset="3561618">These begin on page 162 of the appendix, and I would like to naturally read selectively in the limited time we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.153" offset="3599966">Beginning on page 163 in the middle of card 5, “what can they do?” meaning the union, demand higher wages and expensive welfare and pension plans which could lead to even larger losses than we have had.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.466" offset="3681259">Although on page 69 of the record, I might point out president Sinclair testified that the company made a profit in fiscal year 1965 not losses, can call you out on strike, you people know what it is like, you have had strike experience, I don't think our new ownership will lose a minute sleep over whether the union threatens the company with a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.950" offset="3783137">They have made it clear to me that they look for profit and not a hole to pour money down.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.864" offset="3802781">If we have to negotiate with the Teamsters and cannot reach agreement on a contract under which we can money, they could care less about the threat of strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.406" offset="3844995">And continuing on the next page in the middle of card 9, "Now, I would be the last one to blacklist you for getting another job if this plant close by strike, but the Teamsters can't guarantee you another job either."</text>
            <text syncTime="950.993" offset="3907375">Again, let's look at facts head-on, no one likes to admit his getting older.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.825" offset="3930676">We are all Jack Benny's, we're never going to be over 39, but we don't look that way to an employment manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.811" offset="3966621">Most companies probably have a large number of applicants, who are young, have better educations and certainly, a lot better insurance rating than you and I.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.789" offset="4006536">They can be hired for a lot less money, who you have experience, but it is limited to a particular small craft.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.010" offset="4043421">I have assumed in case we are force to shutdown because of a strike that some other plant will pick up your business, our business, excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.116" offset="4075813">This is not necessarily so.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.257" offset="4084381">Pressure is still on from foreign wire weavers.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.380" offset="4096920">Maybe three months from now, I'll force to sell foreign wires if the Teamsters Union stops our production.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.341" offset="4124714">You all know we have had to handle foreign wires in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.700" offset="4142164">Then on the next page at the end of card 12, “I have given you the facts today and by mailings as I know them to be, it's not a rosy picture for you or for me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.213" offset="4196185">Now, the decision is up to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.607" offset="4205798">Perhaps, you feel I'm exaggerating or bluffing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.269" offset="4228472">I'm deadly serious and I'm deeply concerned.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.905" offset="4246967">And the final sentence, “To you and your dependents, this is one of the most important elections in which you'll ever vote.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.939" offset="4307153">We believe that on this record, in the circumstances of this community and this audience, the Court of Appeals correctly held that it was permissible, perhaps not required but permissible for the Board to conclude that the atmosphere of free choice which Congress has ordained for representation election had been undermined by an implied threat, a threat that the employer anticipated that it would not be able to agree to a contract with the union, and anticipated making other arrangements for its wire weaving needs, if the union should win the election that this would lead either to the closure of the plant or in the transfer of the wire weaving operations elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.371" offset="4520835">Under the Act, this was a judgment for the Board to make, subject of course to the safeguards of judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.204" offset="4556152">It is the sort of judgment that the Board has required to make in a very large number of cases every year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.831" offset="4586663">For example, during the fiscal 1967, more than 8,000 representation elections were conducted by the Board, and during the same year, objections were filed with the Board to 1,369 such elections.</text>

            <text syncTime="1140.664" offset="4666075">Mr. Wallace, are you going to talk about the authorization cards here?</text>

            <text syncTime="1145.197" offset="4684152">I am, Your Honor, in just a moment if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.263" offset="4700453">In evaluating such objections, the Board has shown appropriate solicitude for the statutory rights of employers under Section 8 (c) to express their views during the campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.069" offset="4755623">For example in a 1966 decision concerning Ameray's Corporation in Volume 162 of the NLRB reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.459" offset="4793240">The Board held that that following inaccurate and intemperate criticism of the union was privilege under this section, a statement by a supervisor that the company did not want the union end that quote “all they was good for was blowing up people's houses and kidnapping their kids and that they was rammed by nothing but a bunch of gangsters.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.598" offset="4905775">The Board's decision also have upheld the right of an employer to explain realistically to his employees that his business situation is unfavorable and precludes increases in their compensation or other benefits, so long as this is done in a non-coercive way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.898" offset="4978918">The employees in such a situation might still wish to select a bargaining representative to protect them against reductions of benefits or loss of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.512" offset="5021445">Of course, we do not claim that the Board has been infallible in its judgments in every one of the many cases requiring it to draw the line between a protected expressions of views and implied threats, but we do claim that in the present case, the Board's conclusion was an unremarkable one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.869" offset="5110888">It was a clearly warranted implementation of the congressional mandate for protection of employee free choice from the threat of economic coercion by the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.498" offset="5161357">And indeed, we think the case would become remarkable only if this Court were to convert this record into a script which thereafter could be used by employers with impunity to intimidate their employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="1326.697" offset="5410147">That's -- that is quite correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.150" offset="5423940">Of course, that is -- it's exactly the point I meant to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.745" offset="5446301">Now, once it is decided, it was decided in this case that wrongful coercion by the employer to stride the accuracy of the elective process as a measure of employee's sentiment, the Board's remedy of a bargaining order, it seems to me became plainly warranted on the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.853" offset="5542745">The union had made a very strong showing of employee support by obtaining authorization cards from a large majority of the employees; 11 of the total of 14 in the bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.727" offset="5598229">The authenticity of these cards is no longer disputed and the employer never disputed the authenticity of eight of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.759" offset="5630412">No claim has been made that they were obtained by misrepresentation or coercion, the cards themselves which are in the appendix on page 109 unequivocally designate the union as bargaining representative and include an application for membership in the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.909" offset="5698957">In these circumstances, the employer's coercive power during the election campaign permitted the Board, and it does not always draw this inference but it permitted the Board to infer that the employer's refusal to bargain in response to the union's request based on the cards was motivated not by good faith doubt as to the union's majority status, but motivated primarily by a desire to try by wrongful means to dissipate that majority.</text>

            <text syncTime="1437.148" offset="5851930">That -- what I just spoke of was the basis for the Board's finding of an 8 (a) (5) violation, a refusal to bargain for which a bargaining order is always the appropriate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.492" offset="5897383">The Board held moreover in this case that even in the absence of the finding of an 8 (a) (5) violation, the bargaining order would have been an appropriate remedy for the 8 (a) (1) violation and is so indicated by the Franks Brothers case with I referred to in 320 U.S. in which this Court said that the Board had lost its -- that the union had lost its majority because of the employer's coercive threats.</text>

            <text syncTime="1498.105" offset="6095809">Because the employer's 8 (a) (1) violation in this case could not readily be cured so as to restore the conditions necessary for an election free from the effects of his wrongful coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.838" offset="6154742">The Board was warranted in relying on the decisive majority indicated by the cards at a more accurate showing of employees' sentiment that an election would be in the existing circumstances, and thus to decide that the requested right of the employees to bargain collectively should be enforced without further delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.097" offset="6251708">Now, this is not a drastic remedy because as in the case of any bargaining order, there will be opportunities for interested persons to request another election to measure any changes in employees sentiment after a reasonable period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.035" offset="6327463">In sum, therefore, we believe the Court of Appeals was entirely correct in treating this case as a rather routine example of the Board's proper discharge of its statutory responsibilities, which is the flavor one gets from the opinion of the Court of Appeals reviewing this record.</text>
