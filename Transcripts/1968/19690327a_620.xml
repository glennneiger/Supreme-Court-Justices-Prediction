            <text syncTime="29.587" offset="221706">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.750" offset="234350">Somewhat over 20 years ago, I appeared before this Court and argued the case of MacDougall versus Green in which an effort was being made to have declared unconstitutional a statute of the State of Illinois with regard to the right of new parties to a place on the general election ballot for statewide candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.651" offset="329958">In that case which was decided by this Court on October 21, 1948, a majority of the Court held in a per curiam opinion that the particular statute involved was constitutional as a reasonable exercise of the state’s power and specifically it held that it was proper for purposes of the requirements of a new party getting on the ballot that the state could require 25,000 signatures of which at there must be not less than 200 signatures from at least 50 different counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.748" offset="494320">In the State of Illinois, there are 102 counties, and the population facts which were set out in the opinion then are substantially the same as they are now accepted the disparity between the more populous counties of Illinois and the less populous counties has somewhat increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.584" offset="569657">We have here before this Court today virtually the same statute not on behalf of a new party but on behalf of independent candidates who sought to have themselves placed on the general election ballot as candidates for officers for the position of electors of president, vice president of the United States in the last general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.120" offset="659832">And we are asking this Court now to reexamine MacDougall versus Green and to determine that it should be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.993" offset="699329">The issue is precisely the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.233" offset="712286">Is it proper for a state as condition of candidates getting on the ballot, who are not the candidates of one of the established political parties?</text>
            <text syncTime="163.931" offset="759097">Is it permissible for the state to impose in addition to numerical standards?</text>
            <text syncTime="170.735" offset="786265">Is it permissible that the state require that the numbers of voters who signify their determination to put candidates on the ballot must be distributed in a certain fashion throughout the state based upon where those voters reside?</text>

            <text syncTime="190.272" offset="864423">The only difference is that there, it was Section 10.2 of the Illinois Election Code which dealt with new parties and here it’s Section 10.3 which deals with independent candidates.</text>

            <text syncTime="282.558" offset="1233586">I would say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.591" offset="1237765">In the dissent that Mr. Justice Douglas wrote in MacDougall versus Green, there is the suggestion that it might be permissible to require a distribution of signatures provided that the distribution was proportionate to the population of the geographic areas involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.294" offset="1320521">So that I suppose you could state that if 25,000 signatures were required, it would be permissible for the state at that point to say those 25,000 signatures must be distributed throughout the state in proportion to the voting population of the various counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.952" offset="1387186">That particular issue is not here, that is correct.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="324.920" offset="1403068">Well, I mean to say, what is here though is the fact that this question and the specific context of the demographic facts in the State of Illinois, in the distribution of people among the counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.434" offset="1473076">Here you could get, -- let's say, you could get the signatures of over 90% of the voters of the state and still not comply with its statute.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="358.947" offset="1539114">And you might have another state in which a statute of this sort might work without that rather startling consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.097" offset="1587806">If you have the population distributed more or less equally among the requisite number of counties.</text>

            <text syncTime="381.281" offset="1628453">But I think I would interpret this Court's decision in Reynolds versus Sims as indicating that absent some of remarkable showing of the purpose of geographic distribution of voters, that if the unit with respect to which the candidates are concerned, let us say a statewide that then the validity and affect of a voter's indication of his intent should have nothing to do with where he lives.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.252" offset="1776410">And since, we elect in Illinois, the candidates for statewide office on a statewide basis, it would seem to me that there's a good reason for arguing that if you began imposing even some geographic distribution proportionate to population as a condition of putting the candidates on the ballot, that this might well in itself be an invalid research.</text>

            <text syncTime="477.912" offset="2015065">As you describe it gone far broad in so far as it is indicated, the irrelevancy of geographic location of where a voter happens to live.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard F. Watt</label>
            <text syncTime="599.093" offset="2499793">Correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.593" offset="2501778">In violation of the Equal Protection Clause and basically in line with the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Douglas wrote in MacDougall versus Green and as that view in our position as we see it at least has been adopted by this Court in Reynolds versus Sims and in subsequent cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.012" offset="2607417">For the decisions below was based substantially upon the binding effect of MacDougall versus Green.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.302" offset="2648586">The three-judge Court which heard the matter took the position that if MacDougall versus Green was to be viewed as no longer the law that it should not be the task of three-judge Court to make that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.324" offset="2708668">And in our argument before the three-judge Court by briefs, it was -- we contended that Reynolds versus Sims has substantially undercut the theory by which this Court in MacDougall versus Green upheld the statutory requirement and the view of this Court at that time was that it was perfectly permissible for a state as a condition of permitting candidates on the ballot by nomination petition to show that those candidates had support which was not confined to one geographic area.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.199" offset="2848162">Well, as Mr. Justice Fortas has pointed out, population statistics of Illinois really rather startling.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.469" offset="2881285">Well, over 50% of the registered voters reside in one county, Cook County.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.496" offset="2901347">Well, over 60% reside in the five most populous counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.175" offset="2920051">And the 49 most populous counties have 93.6% of the -- approximately 93.6% of the registered voters which means that any combination of voters no matter how you distribute them from those 49 counties could not under this statute put independent candidates or new party candidates on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.648" offset="3013987">They would have to have signatures from additional counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.726" offset="3034258">Now, one of the necessary effects of this and I think everybody who has ever had anything to do with nomination petitions in which signatures are required, it's always desirable when you file petitions to have surplus of signatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.800" offset="3090578">It may turn out that some of the people who signed think they are registered voters when in fact they are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.313" offset="3112626">It may turn out that some individuals have moved from one residence to another and that their registered voting residence is different from what they put on the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.010" offset="3155362">It may be that some signatures are illegible and consequently, you cannot to be absolutely certain that if you just file 25,000 that you will have a sufficient number of valid signatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.249" offset="3204368">Consequently, anyone preparing petitions of this kind would naturally want to have some margin but you could have any size of margin of additional signatures from Cook County or anyone of 49 other counties and none of those signatures would be sufficient to put you over the top, so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.338" offset="3296737">Now, you could have hundreds of thousands of signatures and in effect, those additional signatures would not count.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.189" offset="3324113">So that at a certain point, an individual from Cook County who signs a petition of this kind is in effect having his signature simply disregarded because it is irrelevant to the requirement and it will not count so to speak to offset the lack of signatures from many of the other counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.575" offset="3405720">It seems to me under those circumstances, that you have essentially the same kind of problem as this Court has concerned itself with where you have gross malapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.764" offset="3450441">The effective weight of one voter's indication of his position whether by signing a nomination petition or by voting really depends upon where he lives.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.216" offset="3500283">If he lives in a small county, it will count.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.231" offset="3512299">If he lives in a large county, it may not count at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.807" offset="3530585">As we read Reynolds versus Sims, this Court has determined as a general principle that the weight of a citizen's vote cannot be made to depend upon where he lives and --</text>

            <text syncTime="990.540" offset="4065573">Now, as I understand the position taken by the state of Illinois and asking that this decision of the court below be affirmed, it is essentially, first, that we really don't have an election here, that in Illinois, presidential electors get on the ballot so far as established parties are concerned by the action of state conventions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.113" offset="4163793">And therefore, there is nothing in the nature of a primary to get them on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.628" offset="4181870">They are placed on the ballot by virtue of official action of the state convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.140" offset="4199946">And secondly, that here we are concerned with nomination petitions and not the equivalent of election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.292" offset="4224502">It seems to me that that argument simply cannot stand because the question is whether or not the procedure is an essential and integral part of the election process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.621" offset="4265880">However, an individual gets officially on the ballot under a statutory scheme, that statutory scheme is part of the election machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.198" offset="4312168">If it's by nomination petition or if it's by primary election, it seems to me the standards should be precisely the same, namely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.130" offset="4343933">What is the effect of a voter doing something?</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.766" offset="4358457">It cannot seem logical to me, at least, that he must have his vote counted regardless of where he lives and his vote must count equally where the vote of every other voter if it's a primary election that is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.160" offset="4420002">But that it is perfectly alright to discriminate against him and wait the votes of some individuals when what you're counting are signatures on a nomination petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.752" offset="4458350">It seems to me that the process is essentially part of the election machinery and it should meet the same standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.818" offset="4486666">The second argument that the state makes is that somehow rather what we are seeking here would interfere with the scheme for independent candidates and new party candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.927" offset="4543091">I really don't understand that argument because as I suggested a moment before, the original requirement in Illinois prior to 1935 was simply 25,000 signatures regardless of where they came from in the state and that the only effect of a decision here determining the unconstitutionality of the amendment would as has been determined by many Illinois cases leave the underlying statute intact and therefore if this amendment were determined to be unconstitutional, the underlying statutory scheme of 25,000 signatures for statewide candidates would continue as a perfectly valid enactment of the state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.379" offset="4704841">So we do not think that a decision by this Court in any respect would interfere with a perfectly understandable and valid procedure and that the only effect of the Court's decision overruling MacDougall versus Green would be to eliminate a kind of unconstitutional restriction upon the nomination process by petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.741" offset="4802330">So we would ask this Court to do what we think the Court in effect has already done and that is by its decisions in such cases as Gray versus Sanders and Reynolds versus Sims to recognize that this kind of geographic requirement which has the necessary effect of giving more weight to one voter's influence than to another should be considered unconstitutional regardless of whether all we're concerned with is a nomination process by petition in as much as the petitions are an essential means for new party and independent party candidates to get on the ballot.</text>

            <text syncTime="1264.637" offset="5161880">Basically, what we have here us we think a very reasonable and workable method for allowing individuals and new political parties to gain a position under ballot in State of Illinois and we have an attack made upon our statutory method of doing so based upon what we think is an unwarranted application of one man, one vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.768" offset="5282461">Essentially, counsel was very correct in that although this case merely reflects specifically as to electors, it does in fact our entire nominating procedure in the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.164" offset="5344005">As Mr. Justice Harlan referred to, Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of our Constitution permits those state legislatures to set up nominating provisions for electors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.627" offset="5405863">Pursuant to that grant of power in the residual powers that our legislature had, we have set up a system whereby any existing political party who has garnered 5% of the vote in the last general election can nominate by party convention its electors or other state officials to be elected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.494" offset="5505337">We also have a provision for new political parties to gain a place on the ballot, not on the primary but on the actual ballot by obtaining 25,000 signatures, 200 of which must be from at least 50 different counties, approximately 50% of our counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.714" offset="5582242">We have the same provision for individual candidate seeking a place on the ballot on the general election, not on a primary election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.163" offset="5620067">In MacDougall versus Green, this Court sanctioned and in fact approved our use and method of allowing individuals and new parties to gain a place on the ballot and MacDougall versus Green has been cited since its decision 20 years ago mainly for the proposition that it was the first case which said, we, the Federal Courts, will decide these political issues in relation to elections which had previously not, they had not taken jurisdiction of, mainly --</text>

            <text syncTime="1941.143" offset="7867956">And we can debase of vote 99.5% of those living in the other counties because we can garner one-half of 1% from one county having 25,000 or more electors, people who are registered to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.988" offset="7943293">And we suggest that that in view of the dissent in MacDougall under one man, one vote would create an unconstitutional situation which would be of greater significance than counsel suggest exists now.</text>

            <text syncTime="2127.164" offset="8612028">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.214" offset="8624253">The second basic issue in this matter is whether or not the Illinois requirements amounts to invidious discrimination whether it constitutes an unreasonable burden, the voters of the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.422" offset="8673050">I suggest to you that Illinois has struck a good balance between the interest of the State of Illinois and the interest of those people who may be disadvantaged by this requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.272" offset="8724459">There is no precise or objective test which may be applied to the situation such as this but there are a number of elements, a number of concepts which may be applied to this particular type of balancing problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.117" offset="8779839">To begin with, is there a showing of some voter interest by the candidate and further is this substantial interest manifest prior to the time of the election?</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.434" offset="8829158">Also, does the candidate have some party structure, some political organization upon which he bases his candidacy?</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.829" offset="8866670">But these three conceptual elements, I think, are all bound together further by the question of the experience of the State of Illinois and more than that, the practicality or the pragmatics of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.995" offset="8919333">A state legislative policy is composed of a number of elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.764" offset="8938454">For example, what is the history of the state?</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.578" offset="8949635">What are the peculiar problems of its geography?</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.976" offset="8959248">What are the attitudes of its people?</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.117" offset="8967816">In a number of other elements, all of which may be variables that could be introduced into this mix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.289" offset="9000521">State legislative objective is also based on an appreciation by the people of the State of Illinois of a particular political theory or a particular political concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.485" offset="9053288">The Constitution does not compel the state to adopt any particular political philosophy or political theory which underlies the legislative objectives which is served by this requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.174" offset="9116087">What then are the legislative objectives which are served by this requirement?</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.877" offset="9134895">To begin with, I think that there's a requirement that a serious candidate must show some voter interest in his candidacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.323" offset="9168645">And a reason for this may be based in part on a political theory appreciation of a legislative objective by the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.807" offset="9198634">I would define it as the majority plurality theory based in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.041" offset="9219532">It would be in a situation where there is a third party candidacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.853" offset="9238758">It very well may be that the candidate with the highest number of votes may not obtain a majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.260" offset="9260387">He may merely win by a plurality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.494" offset="9273344">It follows as a possibility that in combination, the third party may actually prefer the party with the second highest number of votes and in combination the two together may actually win or it's conceivable that they could have won by a majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.918" offset="9334993">This I suggest to you is one possible political theory which may be accepted by the State of Illinois.</text>

            <text syncTime="2327.814" offset="9414614">We get into another area of experience and I suggest this to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.717" offset="9430288">The requirement was adopted by the general assembly in 1935 and it was first imposed for the presidential election of 1936.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.179" offset="9472084">In 1932, the presidential election immediately prior to the imposition of this requirement, there were four independent candidacies on the ballot in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.314" offset="9520671">In 1936, the first year after the imposition --</text>

            <text syncTime="2361.440" offset="9549093">It was also for other offices as well, other statewide offices, so I think it's quite apt in its broadest view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.659" offset="9578036">But to follow, in 1936, the experience was that there were also four independent candidacies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.998" offset="9607398">So I'm suggesting to you on a numerical analysis alone, immediately before and immediately after the imposition of these requirements, there were four independent candidacies and I don't think that we can demonstrate that a requirement which is rather easy to meet indicates that such candidacies would flourish nor does it necessarily follow that a more difficult requirement to meet would indicate that such candidacies would be more of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.648" offset="9721919">I'm only suggesting to you that in the whole political context, there are so many variables that enter into a situation in any given time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.796" offset="9754520">There is no way to project with any degree of accuracy what would or what might occur in the future or what would've occurred had not this provision have been involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.430" offset="9797047">A second legislative objective to be served would be a concern by the State of Illinois that any proliferation of independent candidacies might tend to confuse the voters and I would distinguish the Ohio situation which is before the Court in the Williams case from the Illinois situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.519" offset="9889416">In Ohio, there was a requirement that there'd be signatures from 15% of the voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.991" offset="9919300">The numerical figure was I think something like 433,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.293" offset="9936541">In Illinois, the comparable figure is that we require only one-half, approximately one-half of 1% of the total voters or 25,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.576" offset="9977710">So it's a much easier provision to meet in terms of a numerical analysis alone.</text>

            <text syncTime="3091.567" offset="12469687">Mr. Friedman has indicated certain theoretical justification for the requirement and these are really a matter of political theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.506" offset="12513364">I would suggest they're also a matter of speculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.906" offset="12526947">In the State of Illinois unfortunately, we do not have the kind of material which makes it possible to determine what the legislature really had in mind when it adopted any given piece of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.767" offset="12574490">We do not have the raw material for determining legislative history and legislative intent, so that in order to speculate that there's a particular theory back of this, I would say that its interesting speculation but I don't think that it is anything which this Court can rely on in determining what the legislature had in mind in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.512" offset="12665396">I honestly don't know and I seriously doubt if there's anyway of finding out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.801" offset="12682533">As to whether this is a substantial obstacle or not, I think the answer is clear that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.963" offset="12707192">That it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.933" offset="12715133">There are many, many counties in Illinois where there are fewer than 10,000 registered voters and furthermore, there's one additional requirement that must be kept in mind with regard to ballot signatures for a nominating a petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.821" offset="12774693">Anybody who voted in either the democratic or republican primary is ineligible to sign a petition for either an independent candidate or a new party candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.767" offset="12818474">The result is that it is not simply sufficient to look to the total number of registered voters in any given county.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.360" offset="12844805">You also have to take into account that many of them as potential signors of petitions are automatically eliminated if they voted either the republican or democratic primary, so this makes the obstacle a little bit tougher to get over.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.952" offset="12903215">I don't think there's any doubt that this particular requirement can be met but I also don't think there's any doubt that it is in a number instances kept people from the ballot.</text>

            <text syncTime="3277.389" offset="13212923">Well, I suppose you could have almost any variety of techniques for getting independents or new party candidates on the ballot Mr. Justice Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.599" offset="13245733">In England, as I understand it, you pay a deposit and simply sign papers and pay a deposit of 200 Pounds for certain offices and if you fail to get a requisite number of the votes, you forfeit your 200 Pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.986" offset="13307277">I have not heard that in England, they have a terrible problem of proliferation of political parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.061" offset="13327653">I think this is really an unreal fear that's used to justify a technique which realistically has a tendency to monopolize the ballot of the existing parties.</text>
