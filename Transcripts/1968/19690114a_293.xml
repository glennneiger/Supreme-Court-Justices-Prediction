            <text syncTime="43.357" offset="277797">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, this case involves the constitutionality of the Georgia obscenity statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.505" offset="334430">The questions raised by this appeal, in so far as the constitutionality of the statutes is concerned, are two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.064" offset="380615">First, we raise the question that the statute violates the First Amendment because it punishes the mere possession of obscene material without requiring any further overt act on the part of the possessor or intent to do anything with it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="91.809" stopTime="93.984">
            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="91.809" offset="471625">What kind of possession was this?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="wesley_r_asinof" startTime="93.984" stopTime="173.356">
            <label>Mr. Wesley R. Asinof</label>
            <text syncTime="93.984" offset="480298">This was a possession, if Your Honor please, where Robert Eli Stanley had possession of three reels of motion picture film in a desk drawer of his upstairs bedroom of his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.449" offset="550201">There was no allegation in the indictment of any showing or attempt to exhibit or show these films or pander them or show them to minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.725" offset="595341">The only question involved in so far as the indictment was concerned was that he possessed them knowing them to have been obscene or that he should reasonably have known them to have been obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.692" offset="655214">The second question of our constitutional attack on this statute is the use of the language in the statute and in the indictment to the effect that he reasonably should have known of the obscene nature of the film removes the element of scienter from the definition of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.893" offset="735984">And thus, permits the state to secure a conviction for possessing these films on a showing less than actual knowledge on his part that they were obscene.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="173.356" stopTime="176.851">
            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="173.356" offset="797842">Are they concededly obscene?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="wesley_r_asinof" startTime="176.851" stopTime="306.481">
            <label>Mr. Wesley R. Asinof</label>
            <text syncTime="176.851" offset="811844">We do not concede them to be obscene and if we took that position with the trial court that under the First Amendment in so far as possession itself is concerned that there is no such thing as obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.743" offset="867328">The reason we took that position and now take this position is this, that it would be a violation of the Freedom of Press Clause of the First Amendment to restrict a person or to prohibit a person from possessing anything they want in so far as its claim of obscenity is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.321" offset="957712">We take the position that where a person merely possesses an article alleged to be obscene and does not attempt to distribute it or show it to any other persons, as was the case in this case and as was the indictment in this case and as with the holding by Supreme Court that the mere possession is an offense under the definition Georgia law that any evidence in the case on the part of the state or any contention on the part of the state to the effect that the evidence might have circumstantially show that he was about to have a party and about to show these films to other persons would be completely irrelevant for this Court to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.303" offset="1109640">It has no relevancy here because of the fact that he was only charged with the mere possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.170" offset="1137121">Now, to my knowledge, this exact question has never been passed upon by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.651" offset="1163034">The question of whether or not a person can be prohibited by the states from merely possessing obscene material or obscene writings or pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.134" offset="1204935">Clearly, it would seem to me that the mere possession, that anyone would have the right to say draw a picture which might obviously be obscene to some other persons and put it in his pocket or put it in his desk drawer.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.909" offset="1268046">Or if he wanted to take a picture of himself or picture of himself and his wife in a sexual act that this would be a matter that he could determine as long he did not attempt to pander this material, attempt to sell it, distribute it, or distribute it to minors.</text>

            <text syncTime="329.471" offset="1422273">They were federal and state officers, were armed with a federal search issued by United States Commissioner on a claim that the defendant was violating the Wagering Tax Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1462.346" offset="5953787">This contention is without merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.305" offset="5965594">Now, Your Honor, as we have pointed out in our brief, this Court has consistently held that where a state statute is interpreted by the highest court of its state, that this Court is bound by the construction placed on it by that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.123" offset="6036856">That happened in the Michigan, another obscenity case which the Court of course is familiar with and also in the last Ginsberg case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.310" offset="6073637">Now, in the last Ginsberg case, the New York statute which defined knowledge as this, the word “knowingly possess obscene matter”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.293" offset="6137584">The New York statute said define knowingly as having general knowledge of or reason to know, the exact same words that were in the Georgia statute or reasonably should know or a belief or ground for belief which warrants further inspection or inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.068" offset="6216683">In other words, in the Ginsberg case and that's the G-I-N-S-B-E-R-G case, being two Ginsberg cases in the obscenity field, this Court accepted the construction placed on the scienter feature of the New York statute and said as we are bound to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.106" offset="6296827">Now, the Georgia Supreme Court said in response to Mr. Asinof's contention that the language of the Georgia statute if such person has knowledge or reasonably should know of the obscene nature of the matter, does not remove scienter from the offense but is merely a statutory expression of a rule of evidence which has been extent in Georgia courts for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.570" offset="6414691">That is the only way you can prove intent or knowledge of a person as to anything as to whether goods are stolen or any element involving intent or knowledge unless he confesses is by the circumstances as to whether a reasonable man in the same position would know or would have knowledge of the obscene nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.428" offset="6510090">So we submit -- I submit very respectfully that by a long series of this Court's own decisions that you cannot go beyond or reverse the judgment of the Georgia Supreme Court on this question of scienter because that is the state court interpreting its own statute and I have cited a number of cases where this Court has said that we are bound by such expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.017" offset="6632448">This Court also said that in the Michigan case, you said in the Kingsley International Picture Corporation case, in about eight cases, Aero Transit, all of which are listed in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.114" offset="6692843">So that moves us on to the second facet of the attack on the constitutionality of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.232" offset="6733281">I submit most earnestly to the Court that scienter is an element of this offense as interpreted by the Georgia court, by the Georgia Supreme Court and if this Court cannot unless you reverse your prior rulings which are set out in our brief and which I have cited to you, unless you reverse that long line of cases, I don't believe the Court could in keeping with his precedent just say we think the Georgia court was wrong and I said that this does not -- that the statute does not contain the element of scienter.</text>
