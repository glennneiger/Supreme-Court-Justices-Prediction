            <label>Mr. Armand Derfner</label>
            <text syncTime="33.732" offset="239344">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.482" offset="250316">The question in these three consolidated cases from the Southern District of Mississippi is how much room Congress intended to leave when it passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to allow the southern states covered by the Voting Rights Act to continue evading the guarantees of the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.254" offset="333385">The answer, we believe, is found in the provision of that Act which is involved in this case, Section 5 in which Congress, after having, in Section 4, outlawed any tests or devices when it was aiming primarily at that time literacy tests, went further and provided that no state covered by the Act might enact or seek to administer any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting where standard practice or procedure with respect to voting different from that in effect in 1964 -- November 1964 without seeking prior approval from either the Attorney General of the United States or getting a declaratory judgment from the District of Columbia -- from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia establishing that that new statute or regulation did not have a discriminatory purpose or effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.146" offset="553023">The three cases here, Number 25, Fairley versus Patterson, 26, Bunton versus Patterson, and 36, Whitley versus Williams, all involve statutes which the State of Mississippi passed in 1966 at its first legislative session after the passage of the Voting Rights Act which, we claim, have the purpose and effect of discriminating and voting by reason of race and which are covered -- which are voting laws within the meaning of Section 5 and which -- as to which, there is no dispute that these statutes were not submitted to the Attorney General or for declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.815" offset="715609">In Number 25, Fairley versus Patterson, the legislature allowed a shift in the manner of electing -- allowed a county to adopt to shift its manner of electing the Board of Supervisors with the chief executive officers of the county from beat or district elections to at large elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.797" offset="791573">Thus, allowing a county that might have one or more Negro majority beats to elect all White supervisors if it were a White-majority County as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.924" offset="840056">In Number 26, Bunton, the legislature changed the office of county superintendent of education which have previously been elective to appointive post, and did so with respect to 11 counties of which 9 had Negro majorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.461" offset="914244">Mr. Lichtman will argue Number 25 and Number 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.164" offset="929081">In Number 36, Whitley versus Williams, the legislature adopted an amendment to Section 3260 which provides the manner by which independent candidates may gain -- may get on the ballot and, in effect, set up an obstacle course that was designed and had the effect of forcing independent candidates, except at great trouble and effort, to go into the democratic primary or a party primary and to avoid seeking to run as independents.</text>

            <text syncTime="247.366" offset="1093862">I'm sorry, Justice Fortas.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.353" offset="1105774">Number 36, Whitley versus Williams, arose in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.558" offset="1126672">The statute involved an amendment to Section 3260, was passed in June of 1966 after Reverent Whitley and one other person had run in the democratic primary, Reverent Whitley having run for the Office of the United States Senator, having lost in the primary, and then indicating that he was interested in running in the general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.702" offset="1223220">At that point, the amendment was passed and it had this effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.440" offset="1246208">It multiplied the Number of signatures that a person must gain -- must get in order to gain a place in the ballot as an independent.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.849" offset="1275779">In the case of Reverent Whitley, the Number of signatures was multiplied by -- it was changed from 1,000 to 10,000 since it was a statewide office.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.068" offset="1316634">It required these signatures --</text>

            <label>Mr. Armand Derfner</label>
            <text syncTime="307.752" offset="1335442">In Mississippi, at that time, there were probably in the neighborhood of 400,000 or 500,000 registered voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.658" offset="1387060">The second thing it did was to require that these signatures be submitted at a much earlier date than formerly.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.009" offset="1412451">The former practice -- former statute, 3260, had provided that the required signatures be submitted 40 days before the general election, in practical effect, the end of September.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.788" offset="1463547">The new regulation -- the new statute required that the signatures be submitted at the same time as one would qualify for running in the party primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.349" offset="1505761">Now, the statutes governing running in party primaries require that 60 days before the primary a candidate submit his intent -- notice of his intention to run and a filing fee of a small amount to the Executive Committee -- Executive Secretary of his party which means that, under the new statute, whereas someone wanting to run in a party primary had to submit by some date in April, say, $100 or $200 plus a notice of intention to run.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.859" offset="1635850">Reverent Whitley or whoever was govern -- whoever wished to run as an independent had to submit petitions with 10,000 or some-lesser Number of signatures, depending on what office was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.250" offset="1685379">The third and, in some ways, the most significant effect was to impose a new requirement that one who had voted in a party primary could not, thereafter, run as an independent.</text>

            <text syncTime="567.341" offset="2373757">We took it out, Justice Marshall, because we -- in 1967 when this case came up for the second time, the case came up in September, we did not believe we had enough time at that point to put on a case with respect to the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.101" offset="2440840">And so, at that time, though the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment claims remained in the case, and they do remain in the case, now, we entered a stipulation with the appellees, with the Attorney General, that the only issue before the District Court at that time was the issue of Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.935" offset="2508131">This means, by the way, that we would maintain that the constitutional issues are still in the case that Section 2281 did and does apply and that, wholly apart from any question of Section 5, we were and are entitled to a three-judge Court and, therefore, that this Court would have jurisdiction by direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.297" offset="2585558">We did not mean, in any way, to take the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment issues out of the case, and we believe, in fact, that we could prove that if we were put to it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Armand Derfner</label>
            <text syncTime="634.164" offset="2641042">The stipulation, which is in the record at -- it's an appendix to the opinion of the three-judge Court appearing on page 39 of the record here, paragraph 5, that the only issue before the Court at this time is whether or not House Bill 68, amended Section 3260, is an attempt by the State of Mississippi to enact or seek to enact to administer any voting law within the meaning of Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.990" offset="2772386">There's nothing in the stipulation and nothing else anywhere in the case that indicates that the constitutional issues are no longer in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.123" offset="2816899">The final requirement of the new Section 3260 was that every vote -- every signature on the petition had to be in the petitioner's own hand -- own handwriting.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.720" offset="2879279">And, while it's not clear -- while this specific provision has not been at issue or been the specific issue involved in any of the cases in the record and it's not clear just how far this goes, we think it is open to the interpretation, and a fatal interpretation, that this require -- that this would prohibit illiterates from signing petitions on behalf of independent candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.614" offset="2982828">After the statute was passed, Reverent Whitley and two others who were kept off the ballot submitted petitions to run as independent candidates in the fall of 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.968" offset="3036223">They were ruled off the ballot not because they had not complied in time or because they had voted in the primary as to both of which this would've been an expos facto law, but because they had not submitted sufficient signatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.530" offset="3110515">At that point, in the fall of 1966, we filed this suit on -- as a class action on behalf of Reverent Whitley and the two others in their capacity, both as voters and as candidates, and the three-judge Court at that time, without going into any of the statutory or constitutional issues, as an exercise of its equity, jurisdiction, and discretion ruled that these three candidates should be placed on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.444" offset="3226185">In 1967, the situation arose again, and at that point, as the record shows, there were at least 16 candidates ranging from people who were running for Justice of the Peace in various counties, all the way to Mrs. Fannie Lou Hamer who sought to run for state senate from Sunflower County who had been ruled off the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.976" offset="3304344">I should mention that the 1967 elections were the statewide elections in which virtually all state offices were being chosen.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.951" offset="3340184">This was the first time in modern history that any substantial Number of Negro candidates had run or sought to run.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.091" offset="3364739">It was also the first time in modern history that any -- that, with the exception of a single Negro community in Mississippi, that any Negro candidates have been elected.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.362" offset="3401832">These 16 people or more were kept off the ballot for various reasons, although they had complied or would've complied with the old provisions of Section 3260.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.071" offset="3444673">At that time, we brought the suit on again and, this time, the three-judge Court ruled against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.355" offset="3469855">And, it was from that decision which held essentially that Section 3260 dealt only with elections or with candidates but not with voting, that this appeal was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.255" offset="3513428">The point of this appeal, we submit, is very much like the point in Williams versus Roads decided by this Court yesterday in which the Court said dealt -- dealing with the right of the American Independent Party to be on the ballot, spoke of the Ohio provision as a burden on the right of qualified voters regardless of their political persuasion to cast their votes effectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.532" offset="3626486">I think it's significant that Section 3260 is the first -- one of the first major attempts by the State of Mississippi to deal in any significant way with the problem of general elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.797" offset="3679566">Mississippi, is perhaps the most or certainly one of the most confirmed of the one-party states of this nation, has always paid a great deal of attention to regulation of primary elections than to regulation of general elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.703" offset="3731184">The two outstanding examples of that are the Corrupt Practices Act which, in Mississippi, applies only to primary elections and not to general elections and the requirement of the runoff which, again, applies only to primary elections and not to general elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.554" offset="3790639">The tradition in Mississippi has always been that whoever wins the primary is essentially the winner of the general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.023" offset="3820523">In most cases or many cases in recent history, there has not been any opposition at the general elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.961" offset="3852288">At the same time, with the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a new factor came into Mississippi politics and this was the Negro voter.Prior to 1965, various figures in the reports of the United States Civil Rights Commission, other figures indicated that something like 7% of the eligible Negro voters in Mississippi were registered to vote.</text>

            <text syncTime="1334.973" offset="5444295">No, I think a statute like that should be submitted, that it is covered by Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.410" offset="5466028">You can think of the example, suppose -- take the Grandfather Clause case for this Court when -- and its progeny.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.133" offset="5496957">Suppose the statute said not simply that one who is the -- was eligible to vote in 1867 was the ancestor of one who was eligible to vote may vote without registering, one who is not may not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.539" offset="5558502">Suppose the statute said one who was eligible to vote in 1867 may run for office as an independent or may run for office, if he was not so eligible to vote or his ancestor was not then he may not run for office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.193" offset="5609179">We think that's precisely the sort of thing that is covered by Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.093" offset="5652752">I might say in this connection that the appellees have talked about the language of Section 5 as being somewhat narrower.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.463" offset="5710221">They've talked about the use of the word "comply" in the second sentence of Section 5, and they've said "unless and until the clearance is obtained, no person shall be denied the right to vote for failure to comply."</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.944" offset="5764138">We think, there, that the words "comply" were not intended to be and should not be read as limiting the terms "voting standard, practice, procedure, prerequisite, or qualification."</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.785" offset="5819517">The word comply,taken in its most logical sense there, would apply to the qualification or prerequisite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.125" offset="5852850">It would not be an Act limiting phrase with respect to the phrases "standard practice or procedure" which were inserted in the Act after its introduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.163" offset="5889003">For example, we can think of examples that I think would, even more clearly than these cases, be covered by this -- by Section 5 as to which the word "comply" would not be an appropriate word, and these have to do, for example, with various actions of the election officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.342" offset="5961728">For example, chan -- a law changing the counting of the ballots from a public counting to a secret counting, or a law changing the polling places from public buildings or public places to private places, thus, allowing polling places to be held in -- on plantations or stores or what have you or, for example, a law that abolish the use of poll watchers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.210" offset="6061202">All these, I believe, it would clearly come within Section 5 and these do not fit as clearly within the use of the word "comply."</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.752" offset="6099446">I think those are good examples showing why the word "comply" should not be read as limiting the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.146" offset="6136957">I think the coverage of Section 5 is the fact that all these statutes may have to be submitted for approval is not one that should be regarded as a reason to narrow the scope of Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.311" offset="6241656">Certainly, it's strong medicine but Congress knew when it passed Section 5 that it was dealing with a virulent disease and the very fact that great Numbers of submissions have come to the Attorney General from -- in almost every case from states other than Mississippi, I think, indicates that Congress meant for the easy statutes, the obvious statutes, the statues that were constitutional to sail through, and they have sailed through, but Congress meant to put a block on the states from monkeying around with the Fifteenth Amendment from doing the things that they have been doing that previous statutes had failed to curve, and --</text>

            <text syncTime="1616.541" offset="6570590">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.355" offset="6581770">In November 1963, five White persons were elected members of the Boards of Supervisors, the principal governing officials in Adams and Forrest Counties, Mississippi, the counties involved in Fairley versus Patterson, Number 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.067" offset="6652615">At that time, Negros were almost totally disenfranchised in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.124" offset="6672886">In August of 1965, the Voting Rights Act was passed and, by June 1966, it was estimated that 132,000 Negros were registered to vote in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.991" offset="6724399">About the same time, the Mississippi legislature amended Section 2870 of the Code and presented those five supervisors -- those five White supervisors in Adams and Forrest Counties with a vehicle or device to continue themselves in office, that is, the legislature gave those supervisors the option or the power to adopt an order switching from a district-by-district election system to an at large system in the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.615" offset="6854907">Therefore, in Adams County where census figures show that Negros have a majority in beats 2 and 4, in fact, a 2-1 majority in beat 4, and where census figure shows that Whites have a countywide majority, the supervisors who were elected in November of 1963 were given a vehicle by which they could stay in power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.810" offset="6963681">And, in Forrest County, the other county involved in Fairley versus Patterson, where beat 3 was closely divided in 1960 and where Negros now claims a slight voting majority and where Whites have a heavy countywide voting majority, the supervisors who were elected in 1963 also chose in 1966 an at large system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.558" offset="7074649">A close look at this statute, Section 2870 as amended in 1966, shows that a simple majority of the supervisors, three out of five, may order an at large election where it serves their interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.052" offset="7140582">In other words, suppose a Negro were elected supervisor in one of those two counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.244" offset="7173392">For the next election, the remaining supervisors, those remaining supervisors could adopt a countywide at large system and ensure the defeat of that Negro supervisor elected prior to the at large system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.516" offset="7254476">To be sure, the statute, if you look carefully at it, contains a referendum pet -- provision, but it's hardly a safeguard here, where we can expect the countywide White majority in that referendum to ratify the decision of the supervisors to go at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.180" offset="7341098">Mississippi answers "look how malapportioned we were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.326" offset="7361682">Our population -- our districts were very uneven in population terms, and we're only complying with the one man-one vote mandate of the United States Constitution."</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.702" offset="7407240">First of all, as Justice Harlan indicated earlier, the issue before this Court is not the precise motivation of the supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.471" offset="7450290">That is the question for the Attorney General upon submission or for the District Court for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.399" offset="7474009">The question for this Court is, given the real possibility that this amendment to Section 2870 is a vehicle or a device to perpetuate the disenfranchisement of Negros, does Section 5 in its broad sweep cover the new law?</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.233" offset="7549346">Appellants in Number 25 submit that this is exactly what Congress intended.That Congress intended, once and for all, to make the Fifteenth Amendment effective but, to do so, Congress concluded that any new statute relating to the effectiveness of the right to vote, that any new statute such as this, must be scrutinized by the Attorney General before it becomes operative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.717" offset="7667315">In Number 26, the second case, about which I shall speak, the Bunton case, we are dealing with a 1966 amendment for which Mississippi has offered no explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.427" offset="7722068">The old law was simply that old -- that all county Superintendents of Education, surely the most important single educational official in the count, the person in charge with carrying out the mandate of this Court and of the constitution to integrate schools, the old law was that this official, the county Superintendent of Education, was elected unless 20% of the voters petitioned for an election on the question of whether or not to make it appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.054" offset="7848605">Suddenly, 10 months after the passage of the Voting Rights Act, in August of 1965, 11 of Mississippi's 82 counties were, in effect, told "your county Board of Education shall appoint your superintendent of education," and the record shows that 9 of those 11 counties have Negro majorities.</text>

            <text syncTime="3470.147" offset="13984977">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.421" offset="14002113">The issue this morning is a statutory interpretation one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.731" offset="14023325">It involves the responsibilities of the states and the rights of citizens under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.966" offset="14068255">As has already been presented before the Court, the major and overwriting issue is whether failure to comply with the procedures of Section 5 precluded enforcement of the changed laws concerning the election of County Supervisors, the appointment of County Civil School Superintendents, and the requirements for qualification of Independent candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.386" offset="14189986">The argument thus far has focused on one of four issues, which the appellees have projected in the case in which we believe are in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.079" offset="14244739">I'd like to state them and I'm prepared to present argument on each of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.251" offset="14261352">The first is whether Section 5 is limited to the qualifications for registration to vote or whether it reaches beyond that scope to cover changes which affect voting and may violate the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.067" offset="14344631">The second issue, not yet discussed, is whether, where a state fails to comply with the procedures of Section 5, a person whose vote is affected has a private right of action to seek to enjoin the enforcement of that changed law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.872" offset="14439926">The third issue is whether, if such a private right of action is authorized by Section 5, it must be bought -- brought as the suits here were brought before three-judge Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.747" offset="14503351">And, the last issue is whether these appeals are mooted because when the Clerk of this Court requested the Attorney General for his views on March 11 of this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.030" offset="14560507">He gave the Attorney General notice of the changes and the Attorney General has not made formal objection, or at least that is how the issue is stated in the appellees' briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.988" offset="14620379">I believe the facts of these cases bear witness to the prophetic vision of the Congress in enacting the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.486" offset="14662384">It was concerned, as the reports of the committees and the debates indicate, that once the barriers to registration were down, the states covered by the Voting Rights Act might resort, as they had resorted through previous 100 years to other statutes to preclude effective votes by Negros.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.767" offset="14779413">The Voting Rights Act was essentially a statute which, one, suspended literacy tests and devices which had been used to discriminate and, two, has had the Courts in the previous few years sought to freeze the presently existing statutes so that when the literacy tests were out of the way and Negros were able to register, those then existing statutes would remain in effect until the Attorney General or a Court of three judges and, in turn, this Court had reviewed the change to determine that the change was not a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.289" offset="14977526">It did not put any final powers in the Attorney General, as we read it.</text>

            <text syncTime="4956.690" offset="19931178">The private right of action, I believe, is indicated by the changes in the wording of the statute which were made by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4967.462" offset="19974228">As submitted by the President and the Administration, "the Bill prohibited enforcement of any," and I insert a word, "new law or ordinance imposing qualifications or procedures for voting."</text>
            <text syncTime="4988.713" offset="20059282">It was a prohibition, in those words.</text>
            <text syncTime="4991.298" offset="20069627">In made no reference in Section 5 to persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="4996.989" offset="20092301">It prohibited enforcement of a new provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5001.665" offset="20111005">Congress refrain Section 5 and broadened it and inserted the words that until a state complies, "no person shall be denied the right to vote for failure to comply with such new qualification."</text>
            <text syncTime="5022.205" offset="20193238">And, our understanding of Section 5 is that, in adding the words "no person shall be denied the right to vote for failure to comply," Congress recognized and created a right in private persons to bring a suit to enjoin the enforcement of one of the suspended statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5046.506" offset="20290414">Without that provision, the private party would have to live under the changed provision and would have to travel the long route of litigation in a suit under 28 -- 42 USC 1983 in which he would live under the changed law and litigate it while the change was in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5072.027" offset="20392500">The private right of action permitted the plaintiff to bring suit to recognize the suspension of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5081.679" offset="20431161">There's no problem about the jurisdiction for the private right of action in 28 United States Code 1343 Section 4 which authorizes relief under any act of Congress protecting civil rights, including the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="5098.989" offset="20500334">We are here contending that there's an implied private right of action.This is what the Cong -- the Court recognized last term in Jones v. Mayer saying the fact that 1982 is couched in declaratory terms and provides no explicit method of enforcement, does not, of course, prevent a federal Court from fashioning an effective equitable remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5122.443" offset="20594166">Now, of course, there are procedures in the Voting Rights Act that provide for the enforcement and enforcement procedure for Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="5132.144" offset="20632931">But, in a Number of cases, Borak -- J.I. Case v. Borak and others under the securities and exchange laws, the fact that one agency has an enforcement responsibility has not prevented the Court from recognizing an implied right of private action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5150.475" offset="20706283">I would like to take a moment with respect to the three-judge Court provision where, again, a question of statutory interpretation is raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="5165.480" offset="20766365">The evolution of the words of the statute, we believe, again shows that the Congress recognized that there would be other actions besides the three-judge action in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="5181.813" offset="20831671">As the senate passed the Bill, Section 5 referred to the three-judge -- I'm sorry, Section 5 referred to the declaratory judgment action required to be brought in the District of Columbia, and then concluded in the last sentence such an action shall be before three judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="5209.473" offset="20942326">And, I would read that law, had it become the law passed by the Congress, as limiting the requirement of three judges to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5223.356" offset="20997810">Indeed, I might also have read it to limit or exclude any private right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5229.855" offset="21023828">However, the House did not accept the senate version "such an action shall be before three judges," and changed that language to read, as it now reads in the statute, "any action under this Section," and my understanding of the change in the language is that the Congress recognized that there would and could be implied private actions and provided that any im -- such private action would be before a three-judge Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="7591.329" offset="30469705">We know that this Court decided in the Avery versus Midland County Texas case that the rationale of the Reynolds v.Sims goes down to the local level, and that was the first time this Court had actually made that pronouncement.</text>
            <text syncTime="7608.018" offset="30536474">April 11, 1966, shown in appellant -- appellees' brief at page 15 in Number 25, now, let's get these dates, Your Honors, April 11, 1966, the Chief Judge of the Southern District of Mississippi, Judge Harold Cox, in the case of Crosby versus Pearl River County in which a suit was filed to de -- command that -- the supervisor to redistrict, motion to dismiss was filed on the grounds that the rationale of Sims did not -- Reynolds did not come that far down.</text>
            <text syncTime="7645.944" offset="30688193">He found that it did in April 11, 1966, and he directed Pearl River County to redistrict.</text>

            <text syncTime="7658.885" offset="30739916">The legislature did not pass this Act until May 27, 1966, having put on notice that the District Courts of the Southern District of Mississippi felt that the reapportionment decision did go down to the county level.</text>
            <text syncTime="7674.773" offset="30803446">Your Honors would have to be familiar with some of the counties of Mississippi to realize we don't have any debates in the legislature and the legislative history which we can bring before the Court, but many other counties in Mississippi cannot be redistrict for the simple reason that the population might be grouped up in the southern area or the northern area like in Hines County, the Jackson is grouped -- the people in Jackson are grouped up in the northeastern Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="7702.584" offset="30914727">So, the legislature felt that they must do something, put on notice by the District Court that they were going to apply this Court's decision in the Reynolds case to allow these counties to do something to comply with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7720.964" offset="30988288">There is just an impossibility in many of the Mississippi counties, I'd say in many counties throughout the United States, to actually draw off lines, rational lines, and put the population where they would not be within a certain percent of the ratio in the five districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="7740.590" offset="31066760">Your Honor, because of the way that the population is grouped up in one area, and we must not only take in the consideration, I think this Court has said we don't have to take in completely the population, you would have all of the county grouped up in here and the people down here having very little representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7762.590" offset="31154740">There are a Number of people scattered throughout that area but of different diverse types of economics, maybe farmers here and maybe blue-collared workers here and, up in this area, white-collared workers and your wealthier people.</text>
            <text syncTime="7778.809" offset="31219628">It has been shown just by surveys through survey companies that it is almost an impossibility in some of the counties for us to really redistrict.</text>
            <text syncTime="7789.339" offset="31261738">Now, of course, this Court, as I read the decisions, have placed in the Virginia Beach case its stamp of approval upon the very thing which these two counties had done, and also made mention and, I guess, reapproved the Virginia Beach case in the Avery versus Midland County Texas case So, what I was trying to get before the Court that, irrespective of what counsel might thought was the reason for doing this, there were good concrete reasons existing in Mississippi's District Courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="7839.972" offset="31464239">And I was really merely asking -- answering a question posed by Justice Fortas when he was, I think, he asked if there'd been any commands by the District Courts or commands by any Courts to redistrict.</text>
            <text syncTime="7852.482" offset="31514290">And, I was answering that question and, on July 27, 1966, a three-judge District Court had called upon one of the counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="7861.259" offset="31549398">That was prowled of what was done in Adams and in Forrest Counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="7867.911" offset="31576043">Now, moving on from that question, Your Honor, we come to the question which was actually raised or not raised but urged by this Court, and that is to the jurisdictional question and one in which the government was asked to file a brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="7883.943" offset="31640200">Whether or not this Court has jurisdiction because, there, was a properly convened a three-judge District Court in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="7893.888" offset="31679906">Now, we're all in accord, I think, on this one principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="7899.193" offset="31701117">How do you read the last sentence of Section 5 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="7906.141" offset="31728912">It is just that simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="7908.547" offset="31738629">Whether any action under this Section, and I'm quoting from page 6 of our brief, any action under this Section shall be heard and determined by a Court of three judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="7921.483" offset="31790352">Now, we say that that sentence was merely referring to the subject matter that is referred to in Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="7932.434" offset="31834133">The only subject matter referred to in Section5, the only action referred to in Section 5 in the Court is a declaratory judgment in the District Court of Washington,, D.C.</text>
            <text syncTime="7944.447" offset="31882198">And, that is when if first we have submitted our new laws to the Attorney General's Office and he has refused to approve it and then we file our case in the Washington, D.C.Court or if we wanted to bypass for some reason, I don't know what reason we might have, the Attorney General's Office, we proceed originally in the Washington, D.C. Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7967.445" offset="31974149">That is the only action, Court action, with Section 5 or the subject matter of Section 5 is concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="7974.617" offset="32002884">And, we say to the Court that that terminology, under this Section, was referring to the declaratory relief or declaratory judgment in the Washington, D.C. Court, and this Court does not have jurisdiction because the three-judge Appellate Court -- I mean, three-judge District Court in the Southern District of Mississippi was improperly convened.</text>
            <text syncTime="7999.014" offset="32100477">If any action lied at all, forgetting about all the other technicalities, the jurisdiction would have been in a one-judge District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8009.076" offset="32140706">And, as I say, of course, we'll admit that is not necessarily compel, as Justice Holland said in the Swift case, does not compel a reading of that but it is a more appropriate reading, and the rationale of the Swift case was, in construing 2281, that anytime we construe any section which gives jurisdiction to a three-judge Court we should construe it in a limited manner to keep from placing the burden upon three judges and the Appellate Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8046.281" offset="32289499">Now, counsel opposite says that it is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="8050.013" offset="32304441">Why is it appropriate?</text>
            <text syncTime="8051.642" offset="32310920">Because of the rationale of 2281 and the concern of Congress that we have here a clash between the State of Mississippi and appellants on what we can enforce and what we cannot enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="8066.831" offset="32371733">Well, of course, that isn't true, and that was laid to rest in the Swift case.</text>
            <text syncTime="8071.198" offset="32389183">We are not really concerned with a clash between the State of Mississippi and its laws on a constitutional ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="8080.096" offset="32424814">We are merely concerned with the same clash that you found in the Swift case with the Supremacy Clause and whether or not what we had done in Mississippi is in disregard to an Act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="8096.243" offset="32489388">So, it does not rise to the dignity of what Congress was worried about when they enacted 2281.</text>
            <text syncTime="8104.401" offset="32521989">It does not rise to the dignity of a one-judge District Court enjoining the operation of a state law on unconstitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="8115.048" offset="32564621">And, as this Court held in the Philips case, if we are merely talking about whether an individual was unconstitutionally applying the law, even in that case, we would not have this situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="8756.453" offset="35130159">Now, it's rather odd that the government at this time takes the position that a private party can bring a lawsuit when, in the Apache County Arizona case in which we've cited in our brief citing their brief, they say the responsibility -- the complete responsibility rest with the government and, in that particular case, they tried to keep the -- some of the Indians of Arizona from intervening because they said "no, you don't have any right in this lawsuit."</text>
            <text syncTime="8790.034" offset="35264533">We are vindicating a public right and, in their brief, they took the position that the responsibility rest in the Attorney General and they set out as one of the sections, Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="8803.660" offset="35319077">Now, as Justice Black said in his dissent in regard to Section 5, this is something new in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="8811.235" offset="35349379">This is something that's harsh in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="8813.767" offset="35359514">And, as this Court said, it is harsh, but harsh means "when necessary."</text>
            <text syncTime="8819.445" offset="35382188">Therefore, we do not believe that Congress would've placed this type of action, this type of remedy in just at the whim of any individual who wanted to bring a lawsuit and say "now, look, you haven't gone up in the Attorney General's Office first."</text>
            <text syncTime="8837.892" offset="35455958">Look at the ratifications that might come from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="8840.933" offset="35468079">Let's assume that we did go to the Attorney General's Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="8843.403" offset="35478006">Let's assume that we went up there with the Act itself and said "Mr. Attorney General, here is the Act, read it and will you give us a written opinion."</text>
            <text syncTime="8852.461" offset="35514264">And, he says -- he reads and he says "that is fine,I have no objection to it."</text>
            <text syncTime="8858.055" offset="35536624">I don't know of any publication of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="8859.918" offset="35544043">I don't know how any citizen is going to know about that, but every citizen in Mississippi or Alabama, Virginia, or anybody who come within the Act can then say "well, I'm just going to bring a lawsuit because I don't think you've gone to the 1965 Voting Rights Act."</text>

            <label>Mr. William A.Allain</label>
            <text syncTime="9134.412" offset="36642022">That's my position because its' not Section 5 that takes away the authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="9140.239" offset="36665323">It's Section, I think, Section 12 which says no -- or 13, no declaratory judgment shall be entered except in the Washington, D.C. Court, but that is talking strictly to Section 5 and Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="9154.172" offset="36721121">But, I think we must tie this -- the whole thing here that the government themselves had stated, that the responsibility of enforcing this Act is in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="9166.886" offset="36771903">If, let's take on the Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="9169.193" offset="36781202">We had a tested advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="9171.605" offset="36790815">Now, the Act is brought in Washington, D.C.</text>
            <text syncTime="9175.347" offset="36805757">You can't go to the Attorney General's Office under Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="9177.975" offset="36816311">You bring it in Washington, D.C.</text>
            <text syncTime="9180.246" offset="36825401">You have the burden of proving that there's been no purpose of effect of discriminating the last five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="9187.143" offset="36852987">There's no right of intervention for a private party.</text>
            <text syncTime="9191.163" offset="36869078">That's a position that the Attorney General's Office took in the Apache County case.</text>
            <text syncTime="9195.205" offset="36885170">So, we have here again something that you might say is a remedy, but no right in this private individual to come in and say "yes, there had been some discrimination."</text>
            <text syncTime="9204.555" offset="36922577">Now, in the Apache County case, the District Court did allow an intervention but under its inherent powers, but the Attorney General's Office took the very opposite view.</text>
            <text syncTime="9213.885" offset="36959984">Now, the next question, Your Honor, that we come to if the Court did not buy argument on all this other and felt the jurisdiction lies here and the private citizen does have the right, we're talking about redistricting, reapportionment in Adams and Forrest Counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="9232.121" offset="37032918">Now, we say the legislative history, the legislative intent, had absolutely nothing to do with reapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="9241.231" offset="37069281">We say that the con -- the intent of the Act had only to do with things which went directly to the vote of the registration and nothing absolutely to do to how a candidate shall be selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="9257.761" offset="37135423">Now, here, they're talking about a dilution of vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="9260.724" offset="37147335">There'd been no dilution of vote in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="9264.321" offset="37161650">Instead of voting for one supervisor, they may go for five supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="9269.040" offset="37180562">The counties had only done what this Court has commanded in the Avery case, to give the vote to be weighed across the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="9279.945" offset="37224135">Now, we don't think there's anything in the legislative history, in the debates, in this case -- this Court's decision in South Carolina that would ever say that reapportionment cases or redistricting cases were contemplated under the provision of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="9299.718" offset="37303233">And, it's -- to look at the hearings themselves, and this is merely what we call a freezing, what we've got here is a legislative freezing.</text>
            <text syncTime="9309.053" offset="37340641">On several occasions, the Attorney General alluded to the fact that this is nothing more than like a reapportionment case where the Court says "this plan is wrong, go back and get another plan and come in here and let's look at it, and if we like it, fine, stamp of approval."</text>
            <text syncTime="9325.624" offset="37406887">But, nobody asked the next question, the very next logical question, if it were ever in the minds of anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="9333.272" offset="37437503">Reapportionment has been in the minds of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="9336.068" offset="37448683">They'd been trying to get an Act passed so they can take it out of the Court's hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="9341.118" offset="37468850">The next logical question would've been "well, Mr. Attorney General, does this apply to reapportionment cases?"</text>
            <text syncTime="9347.354" offset="37493823">He was talking about the same type of authority, same type of freezing principle and, yet, nobody asked the next logical question.</text>
            <text syncTime="9356.543" offset="37530603">Why didn't they ask the next logical question?</text>
            <text syncTime="9358.858" offset="37539798">Because everybody in those hearings, the President already knew that they were not talking about redistricting and reapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="9367.961" offset="37576265">That they were talking about -- they would directly affect the vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="9373.569" offset="37598626">They were talking about tests and devices and then supplementing -- I mean, putting something else in that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="9380.601" offset="37626838">We know here that Section 4 and Section 5 are connected.</text>
            <text syncTime="9384.469" offset="37642303">Section 5 goes out of the window once Section 4 is no more applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="9388.483" offset="37658290">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="9389.414" offset="37662051">We're talking about Section -- tests and devices in Section 4, and the same type of thing they were talking about in Section 5 was saying that you're going to supplant for the tests and devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="9400.760" offset="37707400">We say to the Court that if this Court finds that this type if actions come within the purview of the Voting Rights Act of 1950 -- 1965, you have almost started the reapportionment, You have taken out of the District Court the right to look at any plan and approve that plan, and they had placed in Washington, D.C.</text>
            <text syncTime="9424.217" offset="37801232">Now, there had been a lot of talk here this morning about "well, if you submit your plan, if it's good, you'll get it approved."</text>
            <text syncTime="9430.464" offset="37826205">Suppose a count -- a state doesn't want to submit the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="9433.187" offset="37837176">Suppose a county doesn't want to submit the plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="9441.533" offset="37870508">This would completely establish what the Reynolds case said, what the Fourteenth Amendment case has said.</text>

            <text syncTime="9561.651" offset="38350952">The first matter I want to discuss is Number 36, if the Court please, the Whitley case.</text>
            <text syncTime="9572.351" offset="38393793">This case was originally brought challenging the amendment of the Section involved on two grounds, one, that it was unconstitutional and the other was that it was in violation of Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="9595.186" offset="38485117">The constitutional issue was completely take out of the case in its entirety by stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="9608.176" offset="38537049">I believe Mr. Justice Marshall asked counsel this morning, first, why he took it out and he said that he took it out at that time because we were trying to get a -- for a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="9621.958" offset="38592219">The present counsel was not a member of counsel at the time this matter was brought in Court at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="9632.324" offset="38633702">The stipulation was entered into at the request of Williams himself and was actually drawn by plaintiff's counsel at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="9656.346" offset="38729832">Does this statute come within the purview of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="9666.563" offset="38770688">It was not submitted to the Attorney General nor was it submitted to the Court of the District of Columbia because we did not feel that it came within the purview of the Act or required to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="9687.779" offset="38855534">And, the Court might note, in the stipulation which is found on pages 38 and 39 of the appendix in Number 36.</text>
            <text syncTime="9705.227" offset="38925333">I was willing to stipulate with counsel that the State of Mississippi in enacting House Bill 68, Mississippi laws of 1966, which amended the Section 3260 of Mississippi Code, did not comply with the provisions of 42 USC 1973 (c) which is Title 5.</text>

            <text syncTime="10772.932" offset="43196144">The position of all the appellants on the question of relief is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="10780.204" offset="43225192">We believe that Section 5 imposed an additional requirement for putting into effect a state statute within its coverage that, in the absence of fulfilling that requirement, the statute was not in effect and it was as if no statute had been passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="10800.559" offset="43306590">Therefore, we believe that, since the statutes in these cases have been void and are now void, that we are entitled to new elections that are retrospective relief as well as prospective relief the day this Court reverses the judgments below.</text>
            <text syncTime="10817.584" offset="43374717">At that point, the proper relief would be for the Court to remand to the Court below for new elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="10826.269" offset="43409512">We don't think it's the job of this Court or the Court below to tell the state what to do about whom to submit the statute to, about whether to submit the statute at all, or about what to do if it wishes to put the statute into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="10840.457" offset="43466250">If the state wishes to submit the statute to somebody and come back to the Court below before such time as is fixed promptly for holding a new election, then that Court might, within the exercise of its equitable discretion, decide to, if there were a favorable determination, favorable to the state, might decide not to hold the new election.</text>
