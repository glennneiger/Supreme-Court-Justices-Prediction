            <text syncTime="47.866" offset="294849">This case concerns two black ladies who were refuse service at the recreational facility called Lake Nixon Club located just outside the Little Rock, Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.947" offset="343124">The respondents are the owners of Lake Nixon Club, Mr. and Mrs. Paul.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.666" offset="366007">Following the refusal of that facility to serve, the petitioners, black ladies, they brought class action in a District Court sitting in Little Rock for injunction -- injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.254" offset="428387">The District Court following that trial held that Lake Nixon was not a facility subject to Title II of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.870" offset="470810">Specifically holding that the food facilities at Lake Nixon were no embraced within the statute and also that Lake Nixon was not a place of entertainment or exhibition within the ambit of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.521" offset="521488">The District Court hold also summarily rejected the claim made by respondents below that Lake Nixon Club was a bonafide private club.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.042" offset="563493">On appeal, the Eighth Circuit affirmed on all grounds with one judge dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.431" offset="585122">This Court grant a certiorari not only to determine questions relating to cover John to Title II of the 1964 Act, but additionally, on the question whether the 1866 Civil Rights Act now portionally cutified as 42 U.S.C. Sections 1981 and 1982 acted to bar discrimination in this facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.819" offset="682611">The petitioners make two -- I should say three principal arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.274" offset="700479">First, that Lake Nixon food facilities where such as to bring the whole of Lake Nixon within the ambit of Title II, second, that Lake Nixon in its entire tables of place of entertainment or exhibition within the terms of Title II, and thirdly, that 1981 and 1982 insofar as a granted an equal right to contract and have an interest in property, granted petitioners the right to have access to Lake Nixon.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.033" offset="827538">The facts in this case are relatively simple and not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.942" offset="843107">Lake Nixon is a 232-acre site located not far from the Lit Rock, Arkansas which has facilities for boating and swimming and picnicking and miniature golf.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.478" offset="889292">It also has a snack bar which serves sandwiches and softdrinks and milk, and it also has in that snack bar a jukebox.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.957" offset="931192">Lake Nixon also advertises its facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.900" offset="943000">Specifically, the record shows that during its normal season which runs from May until September of every year, Lake Nixon ran in 1966, three advertisements every week on a radio station Little Rock as well as utilized the facilities of another Little Rock radio station for similar kind of announcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.057" offset="1027636">Those announcements incidentally, the record reflects were addressed to all members of Lake Nixon, and one could purchase on membership so-called in this facilities simply by paying a quarter for each season.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.425" offset="1081031">Lake Nixon also advertise --</text>

            <text syncTime="256.992" offset="1131290">And after obtaining this admission card, one then had to pay an additional money if he wanted to buy something at snack bar, but he might not pay anything if you want simply to get picnicking or swimming.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.111" offset="1179773">Lake Nixon also advertise its facilities in a magazine distributed locally showing facilities open called Little Rock Today, that was done once the record shows in 1966, and also once in 1966 Lake Nixon distributed an advertisement in a publication which was distributed at the air force base located in Jacksonville, Arkansas.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.427" offset="1329089">The announcements with reference to the magazines are not printed in the appendix or not a part of the record in this case, simply testimony that such will run.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="316.053" offset="1367542">Does the record indicate whether or not those ads, the one in the military magazine, the publication and the one in the publication distributed by the Chamber of Commerce or it was in the hotels where also purportedly addressed at quote “members”?</text>

            <label>Mr. Conrad K. Harper</label>
            <text syncTime="333.968" offset="1439222">There's not specific testimony on that, what there is it's a general statement by Mr. Paul as I recall which says that all advertisements are addressed to all members of Lake Nixon.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.445" offset="1485197">Now, Title II has a comprehensive scheme for coverage of public accommodations as defined, specifically with regard to the food facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.294" offset="1520515">It says that a food facility maybe covered if it serves or offers to serve in a state travelers or a substantial portion of the food which it serves move in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.332" offset="1576730">The evidence shows here as we've just been talking that Lake Nixon during 1966 advertised its facilities and the evidence fairly show -- also shows that Lake Nixon was opened to the general white public.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.360" offset="1628766">Having advertised its facilities to the public and general, it seems clear to us that Lake Nixon was in fact offering it services to members of the interstate public, and therefore for purposes of Title II, Lake Nixon's food facilities were opened to persons in the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.346" offset="1704730">That being so that statute then provides that all other facilities which are opened to the people patronizing the food facility are opened pursuant to Title II.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.579" offset="1761677">The District Court took a different view in this particular question.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.789" offset="1774529">The District Court found that there had been no offer to serve interstate travelers as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.866" offset="1802846">We believe that's a misconstruction of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.456" offset="1813191">Congress had in mind simply an offer to serve people in general and if there were not any evidence of a prohibition on interstate travelers or in this case, no inquiry even as to where people came from.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.375" offset="1864913">Indeed, Mr. Paul didn't even know how many members there were, although he estimated about a 100,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.514" offset="1885393">We think that sufficient to bring this lunch counter, and therefore the hold of Lake Nixon in the ambit of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.715" offset="1922278">Also with regard to food facilities, there is the test that a substantial portion of the food moved in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.012" offset="1947460">The evidence on this issue was simply that Lake Nixon and its snack bar serve hamburgers, hotdogs, softdrinks and milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.143" offset="1983927">The District Court made a specific finding that the ingredients used in the softdrinks and ingredients used in the bread were such as at moved in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.545" offset="2025514">However, he deemed that insufficient for coverage under Title II.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.715" offset="2042232">The Eighth Circuit not disturbing that finding made an additional finding that in its view, the milk at least was locally produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.567" offset="2077654">We submit that since Lake Nixon sole only four principal items, three of which, that is the hamburgers, hotdogs and softdrinks contained out of state ingredients.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.455" offset="2121226">This was sufficient to meet any kind of reasonable substantiality test, and therefore, Lake Nixon as a whole was covered by Title II.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.325" offset="2160724">The District Court took the view that that was not the case and the Eighth Circuit similarly took a view.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.869" offset="2182875">In part, said that District Court, Lake Nixon was a whole facility, not principally engage in selling food for consumption on the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.941" offset="2219133">We of course disagree with that on the grounds that Lake Nixon's snack bar at least principally was engaged in serving food for consumption on that premises, and therefore the hold of Lake Nixon was covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.395" offset="2265004">An additional ground of Title II is the claim that Lake Nixon was an entertainment or -- a facility or place engaged in giving exhibitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.513" offset="2313383">We specifically note here that the jukeboxes were found by the District Court to have been acquired for outside State of Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.790" offset="2346506">That being the case, it seems to us the jukeboxes nationally source of entertainment for persons who may listen or perhaps dance to it, and therefore, this was sufficient for purposes of coverage to say that Lake Nixon was placed, that had entertainment or exhibitions, which in moved in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.356" offset="2416828">Additionally however, the evidence shows that Lake Nixon had so-called surf boards or yachts which were purchased from an Oklahoma company.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.961" offset="2455176">And furthermore that from the same Oklahoma company, Lake Nixon had least certain paddle boats.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.056" offset="2483597">We think this is sufficient again to show that Lake Nixon's sources of entertainment had affected commerce, and therefore, Lake Nixon as a whole was subject to the ambit or Title II.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.878" offset="2526856">And what we've mentioned here as another and further ground for showing that Lake Nixon was a place of entertainment or exhibition, that local people might well come there to be entertained either by their family or by their friends or exhibiting their prows in any given area of Lake Nixon's facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.992" offset="2599372">For the Fifth Circuit seating on bunk in the Miller case, this kind of activity was sufficient to define a place of entertainment and we submit the same was true here.</text>

            <text syncTime="641.784" offset="2670529">Dances were given every Friday or Saturday at Lake Nixon.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.513" offset="2685471">The evidence however does show further that the musicians who played live at those dances apparently were only from Pulaski County, and therefore, were not in commerce within the meaning of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="660.103" offset="2743777">We certainly ask some additional source for showing a place of entertainment.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.590" offset="2769690">That being so with regard to Title II, we turn into possible coverage under the 1866 Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.230" offset="2808247">1981 was specifically pleaded in this case in the complaint, now that the courts below passed upon it because this Court's decision in Jones versus Meyer Company did was not handed down to that of the Eighth Circuit denied rehearing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.118" offset="2863835">We think it manifest that this was an ordinary kind of contractual arrangement, one paid money and in return had the option for bailing himself of services located at Lake Nixon, and the evidence is uncontroverted that the petitioners in this case were denied that right, that contractual right if you will on the grounds have raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.601" offset="2937814">We think nothing could be clearer as violative in 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.077" offset="2955682">With regards to 1982 which provides for equal property rights and no denial thereof on ground of raise, we think could clear also that what really was involved here was, one, have the opportunity to use the property of Lake Nixon, either its jukeboxes or its miniature golf or its swimming facilities, and therefore, the rational of the Jones case would indicated that this kind of property should not be denied to persons on grounds or breaks.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jerris Leonard</label>
            <text syncTime="823.965" offset="3399241">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.464" offset="3417213">I suppose that the first question that would come to anyone's mind in our appearance here is why the central Government should be interested in the case which might appeared be of relatively minor importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.183" offset="3472071">May well be that on the facts as such it is that there are three very important reasons why the federal Government is concerned about not only the issues in this case but the case itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.522" offset="3541452">First of all, Little Rock, Arkansas has an air force base located there in which there are some 15,000 military civilian personnel and the dependence of those people.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.538" offset="3601533">In a county, the size of Pulaski County which is roughly 285,000 according to the census figures, this is a rather substantial population and it gives to the federal Government or rather substantial interest in seeing to it that the people at work for the federal Government are in fact recorded all of their due according to federal law if in fact federal law applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.252" offset="3720338">So, we have that kind of an interest in our employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.481" offset="3737266">Secondly, Title II specifically Section 204 of the Act of '64 gives some unusual obligations to the Attorney General with respect to the question of public accommodations.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.062" offset="3807587">And we are therefore interested in the case because of that admonition in Title II.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.327" offset="3848652">And thirdly, we are concerned and interested because we believe that the principal in this case is one on which we would like to have some settlement, some opinion, a decision by this Court so that we will get some guide to future action in this kind of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.470" offset="3945200">We feel very strongly that our nation has made and is making great progress and the area of bringing equal voting, equal employment, equal housing, and other equal opportunities to our Negro citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.713" offset="4022209">Negroes in greater numbers than ever before, all be it.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.924" offset="4039032">There are still too few in number are beginning to share the fruits of our free economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.496" offset="4069334">But first class citizenship doesn't mean just a good job or the right to votes or sending your youngster to a desegregated school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.769" offset="4110399">We think that first class citizenship means much more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.360" offset="4128789">It means the sharing of in all the fruits of our free society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.307" offset="4148642">It means taking mama out to dinner on Sunday and be able to seat in any place in the restaurant, or go to any restaurant, or taking the kids for a swim on a hot Sunday, or taking your daughter out to begin the teacher the basics of golf at the Lake Nixon miniature golf course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.506" offset="4229413">So, from the philosophical point of view, we have a very deep interest in what the court decides in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.618" offset="4277791">Let me just briefly analyze what our feeling is with respect to the opinions below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.013" offset="4311437">The District Court we feel got hang up so to speak on the issue of a single enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.830" offset="4346650">The fact that these were not the enterprises at the Lake Nixon were not separate units that the snack bar was not owned by someone else, the swimming facilities and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.751" offset="4398373">We would submit to the court that that's immaterial to the customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.020" offset="4415404">He doesn't care whether one person owns all the facilities or whether a group of people own each one of the separate and individual facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.552" offset="4457618">And that further that that concept, it finds no rational basis in Section 201 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.442" offset="4493145">There's nothing in there that indicates that Congress said that intent, and if did, it could have put some verbiage in it which would a very easily delineated that intention such as principally engaged in this or under separate ownership or some verbiage that would have given a clue that one could come to the kind of conclusion that the District Court came to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.250" offset="4596381">And thus, we feel the District Court was an error in a way it apply the law to these particular facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.740" offset="4630340">The circuit Court of Appeals, it used the hook that there was no effect on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.235" offset="4668270">Well, I would submit to the Court that this runs contrary to common knowledge and common understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.682" offset="4698049">Little Rock, Arkansas is not a sleepy little hamlet back out in the woods some place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.381" offset="4736920">It has a major military installation in, it is the hub of a great state, it is on traffic routes, both north and south and east and west, so it isn't very back in the woods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.276" offset="4800449">And the issue whether is whether or not there was an offer to serve, any of these facilities assuming that they are covered under the provisions of Section 201 (b), but the circuit Court of Appeals took to view that it wasn't like consider that question because it did not feel there was any effect on commerce and that it labored over the issue of what percentage of the ingredients in the food or the soda water, whatever else might come on -- might have come to Lake Nixon under pursuant to interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.006" offset="4963349">We would ask the Court to reject that idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.007" offset="4975365">There's ample evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.955" offset="4983202">This Court can used its knowledge, its common sense, things that are of common knowledge to come to a very ready conclusion that advertising three nights a week on the radio station in Little Rock, Arkansas with 15,000 people just that the military installation alone plus the travels that there were bound to be people who were attracted by the ad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.213" offset="5096260">Common knowledge also would tell you that a family staying in a motel might well ask the motel proprietor whether or not his motel has any arrangement with Lake Nixon to use its facilities and certainly it became knowledge, common knowledge are on the air force base that trans inter, if you are white, you could use the facilities at Lake Nixon, but if you were black, you couldn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.640" offset="5225932">And I submit to this Court that now, common knowledge tells us that there were -- that most of the people who were at Little Rock Air Force Base were transits, not in the sense that they were there for a few days, but in the sense that they were residence of another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.333" offset="5296671">And they are just as much in interstate commerce as are the people who are driving through -- the truck driver, the family on vacation; the salesman would have not, and they are entitled just as much for the protection of the law and the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.804" offset="5382562">Now, then, let's get to the more difficult issue, the issue of whether or not we can in fact find coverage in Section (b) in either three under the entertainment and exhibition provision, or under four as what I term a combine enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.240" offset="5476289">I believe this Court can find justification in this case under both these theories, and I would urge the court to consider the possibility of finding its decision on both of these theories because both will then become useful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.485" offset="5549328">Look at the decisions in the Evans case which the circuit Court of Appeals below used to rule against the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.605" offset="5585795">I would point out to you that the Evans case, that Fazzio, that the Miller case are amusement cases and what they in effect say is that Congress wanted -- enacted this section and use that particular as specific verbiage in 201 (b) (3), or other place of exhibition or entertainment meant that a roller-skating ring was a place of entertainment, that a bowling alley was a place of entertainment, that a golf course was a place of entertainment, and when one looks at the Evans decision particularly, the District Court said, I find that because that this is a place of entertainment and that because a team comes once a year from Washington D.C. to Virginia to play golf, that that brought it within the per view of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.163" offset="5824031">What I say that the District Court was really saying and really doing was saying that a golf course is a place of entertainment because it seems to me not logical to assume that there's going to be very many people who come to watch an amateur golf team play the -- its counterpart from the rural golf club.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.868" offset="5926849">That's not going to attract any droves unto any of the fairways except maybe some of their friends who may be waiting at the 18th hole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.355" offset="5964779">So I say that that's not an exhibition in the term that we ordinarily think of a football game, a basket game and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.038" offset="5999574">And that Section 201 (b) (3) specifically assumed and those cases clearly indicate this kind of entertainment, entertainment one gets out or participate as suppose to exhibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.772" offset="6090480">I will urge the court to consider also finding that the provisions o 201 (b) (4), the combined establishment theory clearly apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.769" offset="6138441">The Congress could have used different verbiage if it didn't mean that you have one of the facilities that are covered under two in four, the whole thing is covered, and that make sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.140" offset="6191940">I think that's reasonable to believe that Congress wanted to do that, at least say a whole line of cases whether it be department stores or bowling alleys or what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.989" offset="6235303">So on that theory also, we believe that there is coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.678" offset="6266128">Mr. Harper went into the issue of the coverage under the 1866 Act, we should -- would simply urge the court to consider that as --</text>
