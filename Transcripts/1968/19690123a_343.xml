            <text syncTime="28.479" offset="217318">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.808" offset="234559">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and it is an in rem seizure proceeding brought by the Government against an interstate shipment of five cases of antibiotic sensitivity discs bearing the trade name Bacto-Unidisk.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.240" offset="316374">Counsel have asked the clerk to distribute a sample of the seized article to each member of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.419" offset="353050">The Government's libel alleged that the shipment violated Section 502 (l) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in that the Bacto-Unidisk was a drug within the meaning of the Act was composed in part of specified antibiotics and was neither certified nor exempted from certification pursuant to Section 507 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.580" offset="465690">And the amended answer by the claimant, Difco Laboratories, the manufacturer of the Bacto-Unidisk admits that the article is composed in part of the specified antibiotics and has neither been certified nor exempted from certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.044" offset="547506">The claimant's denial that the shipment violated the Act was based solely on the contention that the antibiotics certification requirements of the statute are inapplicable because the Bacto-Unidisk is not a drug within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.777" offset="618454">And the only issue in this case therefore is whether sensitivity testing discs such as the Bacto-Unidisk are drugs within the definition in Section 201 (g) of the Act which appears on page 2 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.350" offset="700792">This issue arises because Section 507 of the Act imposes the batch-testing certification requirement only on antibiotic drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.607" offset="749798">And these are to find in Section 507 by reference to the general term of drug which in turn is defined for purposes of the entire Act in Section 201 (g).</text>

            <text syncTime="213.443" offset="957106">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.651" offset="962017">Each production batch has to be certified by taking a sample from that production batch in testing it to see that it has the proper characteristics of identity, strength, potency, etcetera, to assure its safety and efficacy of use, and that has to be done before that production batch of an antibiotic drug can be disseminated for use.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.933" offset="1071104">Now, the manner in which the Bacto-Unidisk and similar products are used in the course of antibiotic therapy is described in the opinion and findings of the District Court and in the printed enclosure which the claimant includes in each carton of Bacto-Unidisk and which appears in the record, and to which I shall refer later.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.410" offset="1169011">The discs are used in a screening test which in the words of the District Court serves as a guide to a medical doctor in his determination of the choice of antibiotic to prescribe for the patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.234" offset="1236302">This is accomplished by first drawing from the patient a specimen of affected body fluid which contains the infecting microorganism that is causing his illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.424" offset="1289070">Typically, this specimen is then taken to the hospital or other clinical laboratory and placed upon a culture medium in a small glass dish so called Petri dish where it is incubated for a period of hours to assure that the mature colonies of the principle infecting organism can be isolated from the specimen for use in the sensitivity test.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.373" offset="1400874">This so-called islet of the infecting microorganism is then applied upon a second culture medium in another Petri dish and the dry paper sensitivity discs, each of which has been impregnated with a certain quantity of a particular antibiotic are placed upon the surface of this freshly inoculated culture.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.857" offset="1514768">During the ensuing incubation period of 6 to 18 hours, the antibiotics disseminate outward forming circular zones around each of the small impregnated discs.</text>

            <text syncTime="447.542" offset="1893543">Now, as I say in the test, the antibiotics disseminate outward forming circular zones around each of these small impregnated discs and then if the infecting organism is sensitive to the antibiotic on a particular disc, its growth will be inhibited in the zone around back disc, leaving a clear circle, a so called “zone of inhibition” on the medium in the dish surrounding that particular discs.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.976" offset="2027290">But in the zones around the discs containing an antibiotic to which the microorganism is resistant, the islet will grow leaving little are no clear area.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.662" offset="2073997">From the presence or absence of these zones of inhibition around the various discs, the microbiologist advices the physician which of the antibiotics appear to be effective and which appear to be ineffective against the infecting microorganism.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.639" offset="2145886">This report is then used by the physician as a guide in selecting an antibiotic for treatment of his patient's infection.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="571.297" offset="2388511">Not unless the discs are drugs and the use in the discs is the use as a drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.634" offset="2409932">Otherwise, there would be no batch-testing whatsoever if these antibiotics required under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.234" offset="2444309">Unless, they happen to commingled with antibiotic powders that are going to be disseminated for use directly on patients in which case, they would've been tested that in that form.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.854" offset="2506794">But the batch-testing requirement does require testing of each form of the antibiotic as it's prepared for use because of the peculiar scientific problems of change in the antibiotic from one form to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.346" offset="2576802">It is clear then that these discs contain antibiotic substances which in the words of the statute are chemical substances which are produced by a microorganism and which have the capacity to inhibit or destroy other microorganisms.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.578" offset="2657677">And it is equally clear that the use of the sensitivity discs in medical practice is dependent upon the purported capacity of the antibiotics impregnated on the discs to function as antibiotics to actually inhibit or destroy the growth of microorganisms.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.536" offset="2749524">In this respect, the discs differ from medical books or the Petri dishes in the laboratory or other articles that may also be used as a guide to therapy.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.589" offset="2813680">Now, for more than 20 years, Congress has recognized in Section 507 of the Act and in its successive amendments that because of the peculiar scientific properties of these biologically produced antibiotic drugs, special quality control of procedures must be required to assure their scientific reliability or in the words of the statute to ensure their safety and efficacy of use.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.252" offset="2944397">Section 507 therefore, requires that before it is disseminated each production batch of antibiotic drugs must be tested and certified pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to assure that the drugs have such characteristics of identity, strength, quality and purity as to ensure their safety and efficacy of use.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.690" offset="3058082">At first, antibiotics intended only for laboratory use in sensitivity testing were exempted by regulation from the batch-testing requirement.And that exemption applied to commercial sensitivity discs such as the Bacto-Unidisk which came in to use in the 1950's as the number of antibiotics began to proliferate.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.081" offset="3163721">The exemption of sensitivity discs from the certification requirement was terminated in a rule making proceeding in 1960 in which regulations were adopted to require their batch certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.314" offset="3232580">This is discussed in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.423" offset="3241044">The order adopting the regulations recited that following numerous complaints by the medical profession, hospitals, and laboratory technicians, the Food and Drug Administration made an extensive survey of the condition surrounding the production and marketing of discs and found them unreliable in their statements of potency with resulted impairment of their safety and efficacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.971" offset="3351280">It was therefore deem in the words of the order vital for the protection of the public health to adopt the regulations requiring their batch certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.659" offset="3397987">The question in this case then is whether the Secretary correctly interpreted statute as authorizing the application of the batch-testing requirement to antibiotic sensitivity discs which brings us back to the interplay of definitions in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.677" offset="3482102">The District Court was of the view that a literal reading of the Act's definition of drug on page 2 of our brief and particularly the language in subpart (B) of the definition, articles intended for use in the diagnosis cure mitigation treatment or prevention of disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.162" offset="3583979">The District Court was of the view that this language clearly has application to the sensitivity discs.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.619" offset="3621804">But despite this and despite the fact that drugs are contained in the article again in the words of the District Court, the District Court decided that the Act should not be interpreted as including sensitivity discs as drugs because no part of this article is administered to man or other animals either internally or externally, and its sole function is to provide medical doctors with information for use by them as guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.351" offset="3752730">The Court of Appeals affirmed the holding that sensitivity discs are not drugs within the meaning of the statute expressing the view that the discs only aid to physician to determine what antibiotics to use for the cure mitigation or treatment of the patient's disease and in the words of the court that it was not the legislative intent to apply the phrase intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, etcetera, in such an indirect manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.937" offset="3879163">Neither court cited any legislative history in support of its interpretation of the statutory definitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.369" offset="3940812">We believe first that it is clear on this record and in the District Court's findings that batch-testing of antibiotics sensitivity discs serves the congressional purpose expressed in Section 507 of assuring the safety and efficacy of antibiotic therapy.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.349" offset="4032763">The role of the discs in therapy is adequately described in the claimant's own printed enclosure package in the cartons of that to Bacto-Unidisks which is reproduced in our appendix on page 182.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.914" offset="4107055">We can look at the first paragraph there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.703" offset="4122206">It says that Bacto sensitivity discs and Bacto-Unidisk, only the latter are involved here, are standardized to paper discs containing known amounts of the more commonly employed antibiotics, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.813" offset="4194617">They are recommended as a rapid practical clinically accurate and inexpensive means of determining the relative sensitivity of microorganisms to these therapeutic agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.644" offset="4253968">Bacto sensitivity discs are especially valuable in selecting the drug effective against chronic or persistent infections, refract to age of primary therapy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.395" offset="4313004">The testimony in the case explained that the test is medically important because there are various strains of the same general group or type of infecting organisms such as Staphylococcus, and there are differences among these strains in their sensitivities and resistances to various antibiotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.985" offset="4419271">The claimant argues that it is somehow significant that treatment with an antibiotic frequently as began before the results of the test are known, but that does not disprove that the discs play an important role in antibiotic therapy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.394" offset="4484995">The testimony unequivocally shows consistently with the claimant's printed representations that as a result of the test with the discs, the treatment is sometimes switched from one antibiotic to another, and this is particularly true in the critical situations in which a patient is not responding to the primary therapy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.923" offset="4579035">We've collected those references on page 23 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.933" offset="4599097">In other factual consideration that it is important to this point in my argument also is indicated in the claimant's printed enclosure in the Bacto-Unidisk this time on page 185 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.304" offset="4660537">The little chart in the middle of that page shows that a difference in the concentration or potency of the antibiotic on the disc can make a difference as to whether a zone of inhibition will appear at all in the test and not merely a difference in the size of the zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.957" offset="4755205">Because of this, discrepancies in discs potencies can cause misleading test results and lead the physician to proscribe the wrong antibiotic for this patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.555" offset="4813615">This was explained at the trial in the testimony of Dr. Joseph Turin, Chief of the Bacteriology section of the laboratory in Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit on page 83 of your printed appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.964" offset="4875264">After complaining of the discrepancy, his hospital had found in discs prior to the certification requirement, Dr. Turin explained in the last two paragraphs on page 83, there's a possibility of having too low of potency in that discs, too low of concentration in which case the organism would tend to be reported out as being a resistant one or being more resistant than if the true potency were in the discs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.748" offset="4998353">And on the other hand, you might have too high of potency which means that you would report a sensitive organism which in fact might not be in that very sensitive category.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.262" offset="5040462">So, it might be an error in either direction which would give us false readings and we would be giving misinformation to the clinician and he in turn obviously being unaware of this situation as we would be would not treat the patient properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.323" offset="5116635">Therefore, we feel that we can't take this chance of using discs that are not certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.008" offset="5147355">It to us is a real hazard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.480" offset="5165328">Additional testimony to the same effect to summarize on page 27 of our brief, the point is that the whole legislative purpose reflected in the batch-testing requirement of Section 507 and brought out in the legislative history reviewed in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.266" offset="5240456">The purpose of trying to assure that patients will get the therapeutic benefit intended when physicians prescribe antibiotic drugs for them can be defeated regardless of how pure and potent the pills capsules or injections administered to the patients maybe if because of faulty discs, the wrong antibiotics are administered to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.071" offset="5359679">We believe that a proper respect for the congressional judgment requires that the issue of interpreting the statutory definitions in this case be approached with this background in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.481" offset="5409311">When this consideration is combined with the general principle that the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act is broadly construed in according to its purpose to protect the public health, we think it is clear first that the use of the discs shown in this record is a used in the treatment of disease within the meaning of the statutory definition of drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.716" offset="5510248">The claimant argues that the use of the discs in the course of the patient's treatment is too indirect to use to be considered a use in the treatment of disease within the statutory definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.375" offset="5556851">But this would mean that the discs are neither drugs nor devices within the meaning of the Act since the definition of device used as precisely the same statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.713" offset="5610245">And since the Act's protections against adulteration or misbranding apply only to drugs and devices, the result would be that the public would be utterly unprotected against any kind of mislabeling or adulteration of the discs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.572" offset="5681612">There would be no statutory recourse for example, even if the discs were being marketed with every antibiotic on them falsely labeled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.472" offset="5725288">Nothing in the statutory language or in the legislative history requires a session absurd result which would so seriously endanger the public health.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.414" offset="5769070">The more substantial interpretive question presented by this case in our view is the problem of distinguishing the statutory definitions of drug and device on pages 2 and 3 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.894" offset="5830928">Their terms insofar as pertinent here are almost identical and yet the two definitions are expressly mutually exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.886" offset="5874918">The District Court recognized this problem and undertook to solve it by limiting the statutory term drug to what it believe to be the common medical usage of the word drug outside the statute as articles administer to man or other animals either internally or externally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.139" offset="5971884">We believe that this is where the District Court went wrong because this is inadequate as an approach to the interpretation of this complex technical regulatory scheme for the protection of the public health in which the Congress has provided its own definition of the term drug for the purposes of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.760" offset="6066448">It is a statutory term of art to be interpreted in a manner to effectuate the objectives of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.136" offset="6103960">In our view, Securities and Exchange Commission against Ralston Purina Company in volume 346 U.S. is the exemplary opinion of this Court which illuminates the proper approach to interpreting such a provision of a regulatory statute, so as to accomplish the congressional purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.178" offset="6192044">There, in interpreting the statutory exemptions from registration for a private offering of stock, this Court held that because it was the congressional purpose to exempt transactions as to which there was no practical need for the statute's application, the interpretation of the exemption should turn on whether the particular class of person's affected needs the protection of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.114" offset="6287862">Applying this standard, the Court held that the company's offering of treasury stock to its key employees was a public offering subject to the provisions of the security's Act because in the words of the court, the employees had not been shown to be able to defend for themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.686" offset="6358079">The same basic approach was recently taken by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in distinguishing between the definitions of drug and device in the statute before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.124" offset="6411891">In the case of AMP Incorporated against Gardner which is cited in our brief and in which this Court denied certiorari in number 86, this term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.799" offset="6454523">The Court there look to the practical consequences in terms of the Act's differences in the requirements imposed upon drugs and devices to determine whether the particular article there at issue should be classified as one or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.624" offset="6525889">And the practical consequences of that difference in classification are restricted to a very few provisions of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.622" offset="6553893">In fact, at the beginning when the definition's first came into the statute, there was no difference in the regulation of drugs and devices at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.335" offset="6592763">In our own case, the only significance of the classification of the discs as either drugs or devices as if they are classified as drugs, the batch-testing requirements for antibiotic drugs will apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.144" offset="6651904">And otherwise, they will not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.403" offset="6660995">The scientific qualities of antibiotics which led Congress to require batch-testing are the same whether the antibiotic is used for a pill for a hypodermic injection or is a test to determine what pill or injection to administer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.164" offset="6720031">And as I have said, the record shows that the medical need for assurances to quality and potency exist whether the antibiotic is used on a disc or in a pill or injection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.502" offset="6765380">And it is therefore manifest that the Secretary correctly interpreted the Act to reflect the legislative purpose in concluding that the discs are drugs under Section 201 (g) subject to the batch-testing requirements of Section 507.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.502" offset="6833403">And accordingly, we ask that the contrary judgment of the Court of Appeals be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.871" offset="6858898">If I may, I'll save any remaining time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1707.344" offset="6932773">The chief effort of the Government in its brief in this matter and in its argument has been to create the impression that all or most antibiotic therapy in the United States is based on the sensitivity disc test of which we are talking here today, and that unless this procedure, this testing procedure is controlled by the Government through certification of these discs that the public health will be endangered, patient's lives will be in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.967" offset="7099225">I should come back to that, we shall show you can establish very simply that on the basis of the literature cited by the Government itself and on the basis of the testimony at the trial and the judge's findings in the District Court that these efforts of the Government simply do not hold water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.257" offset="7208417">They won't stand up.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="1778.691" offset="7218134">What do you mean if there is no danger?</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward Brown Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="1780.840" offset="7226702">I mean that there is no danger and I mean that the extent of antibiotic of the basing of antibiotic therapy upon the disc test is far more limited than the Government would have us believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.616" offset="7281873">In fact, I might say right here since the question has arisen that in our brief, page 18, we refer to the figures of the medical market guide which show that in 1967, 77% of the antibiotic sold in that year were purchased on prescription or on, or by a physicians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.976" offset="7399320">Now, it is obvious that only about 23% went to hospitals, which is the Government concedes are the place where these tests are made in the hospital laboratories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.322" offset="7452609">As Dr. Keefer, a witness at the trial said, “I would say from the total number of infections that doctor see and treat, the sensitivity test is not used.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.896" offset="7510915">It is not used for routine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.175" offset="7524080">There's a good reason; that is that the initial therapy with a wide- spectrum antibiotic which the doctor starts before the test is ever began, it takes 24 to 36 hours for the test, is ordinarily successful because of the doctor's experience and the information he is able to draw from other sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.743" offset="7622301">It is after the fact that he looks at the test and as Dr. Keefer stated and the Court found, the test is used to confirm his judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.147" offset="7659917">Now, I should like to make a few remarks if I may about some of the statements made by my friend here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.786" offset="7698474">There was a trial in the District Court which lasted I believe three days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.021" offset="7723447">There were a quite a number of distinguished witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.543" offset="7741524">They knew what they were talking about at least most of them did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.892" offset="7758973">The findings were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.402" offset="7769004">They've been almost ignored by the Government in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.756" offset="7802441">They are not clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.290" offset="7816547">There's no question about that and there's been no contention as the equivocally arise.</text>

            <text syncTime="3450.178" offset="13904123">That is very clear from many of the articles cited by the Government itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.517" offset="13937455">That is true regardless of whether there are certification and it might be added that even under the Government's certification regulations, the claim potency, that is the potency claim on the label of the disc may vary from 67% to 150% in the device itself or the sensitivity disc itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.982" offset="14055320">In other words, you can be from 67% to 150% off and still get these discs certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.316" offset="14088652">In fact, as between the lowest and the highest disc being tested by the Government, you can go as far as 250% off.</text>
