            <text syncTime="23.353" offset="196733">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.892" offset="210944">This case is before the Court today on a petition for writ of certiorari to the Maryland Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.461" offset="241246">There are two issues in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.273" offset="252426">Is Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment applicable to the states to the Fourteenth Amendment and, if so, was the petitioner twice put in jeopardy in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="51.214" offset="308224">The facts of the case, Your Honor, are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.526" offset="321494">The State of Maryland, with jurisdiction to do so, indicted the petitioner for three alleged violations of the Maryland Criminal Code: burglary, common law housebreaking, and larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.968" offset="387218">The jury returned an acquittal on the larceny charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.999" offset="403414">The state dropped the housebreaking charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.502" offset="417416">Jury also convicted the petitioner on the burglary case.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.436" offset="441135">The petitioner then appealed the burglary case to the Maryland Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.108" offset="459839">And, the Maryland Court of Appeals remanded petitioner's conviction, the only thing before it, to the Trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.994" offset="491395">So that, the petitioner could elect to have the conviction set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.112" offset="515845">The remand was made on the basis of Schowgurow versus State which held that Maryland's constitutional provision requiring all jurors to profess a belief in God or swear a belief in God was in violation of the First Amendment of the federal constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.723" offset="586271">Petitioner went to the Trial Court again.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.882" offset="598915">He was indicted again for burglary and common law housebreaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.359" offset="616782">And, because he sought to exercise his First Amendment rights, he was also indicted for larceny in the second case.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.012" offset="655444">In the first case, he was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.386" offset="672893">In the second case, he was convicted this time of both burglary and larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.820" offset="698702">Again, the state dismissed the housebreaking charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.277" offset="716466">And, as a result of the second trial, the trial court imposed a sentence of 15 years for burglary, 5 years for larceny, and these terms to be served concurrently.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.544" offset="777592">Prior to the second trial, the petitioner dully entered his objection on a plea of all the fights acquit, but the prosecutor argued to the trial court that the petitioner had to make an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.811" offset="846660">Either he could allow the burglary conviction to stand or else, if he voided the burglary conviction, he recreated the indictment against him and could be tried on all charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.713" offset="914265">They were prosecuted against him in the original indictment.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward F. Borgerding</label>
            <text syncTime="667.680" offset="2774079">Chief Justice Warren and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.339" offset="2788707">The basic question in this case is that the petitioner's selection to be re-indicted by declaring that his original indictment was null and void under Schowgurow and his subsequent conviction constitutes double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.230" offset="2860283">It is the state's position that it does not constitute double jeopardy in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.935" offset="2891107">Now, as my brother has indicated, Mr. Benton was indicted in Maryland in 1965 of the three counts, as he had indicated, a common law burglary, housebreaking, and the third count was larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.316" offset="2956622">He was convicted of the larceny count or, I mean -- excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.345" offset="2976789">He was convicted of the burglary count by jury in neighboring Prince George's County, and the state abandoned the second count, and he was found not guilty as to the larceny count.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.295" offset="3032586">He appealed to the Maryland Court of Appeals in September of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.504" offset="3061426">The following month, Maryland -- the Court of Appeals of Maryland handed down the decision in Schowgurow, and so, this question of double jeopardy is involved in the procedural set up, and what did Schowgurow provide as far as the Maryland judicial system was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.601" offset="3145749">Schowgurow held that the provisions of Article 36 of the Maryland Declarations of Rights requiring a belief in God as a qualification for grand jury service or petty jury service was in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.014" offset="3227460">And, that was predicated because of this Court's decision in Torcaso, the year or two before, in which this Court held that the Maryland requirement that a public official express a belief in God under Article 37 was in violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.317" offset="3300603">Now, when the Court of Appeals of Maryland reached this decision, it was confronted with, and there's no accurate figures but, a possibly, in the neighborhood it was estimated around, 3,500 indictments throughout the entire judicial system of Maryland that had been indicted by the -- an invalid grand jury, if you please.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.868" offset="3406869">Now -- so, therefore, they limit the retroactivity of this decision, Schowgurow, to the cases that had not become final as of the Schowgurow decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.465" offset="3469249">Now, in order to implement and carryout this, and it was a gigantic proposition that was confronting the judicial system of Maryland at this time, there were several other cases that were decide within three or four days.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.793" offset="3538526">One was State versus Madison.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.746" offset="3550333">The question in State versus Madison was that an accused -- that any accused that was indicted or convicted by such an improperly constituted grand jury had the right to have the original indictment declared null and void or his case retried without showing actual prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.627" offset="3645837">And now, Your Honors, the question there was, should a member of the so-called excluded class be entitled to raise this point or was it limited only to the included class, to what the persons that did not believe in God?</text>
            <text syncTime="902.924" offset="3715114">And, in Madison, the Court, I think, went beyond this Court and held that it applied to both the excluded class and the included class, so that anyone could file and -- in a proper proceeding and set aside his indictment because it was brought back by an invalid constituted grand jury, to which a grand jury that was in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.443" offset="3837158">Now, in order to -- and, also, you'll note in that decision they held that the individual did not have to show prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.855" offset="3878745">This was another attempt to protect the rights of the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.143" offset="3895986">He had no need to show pric -- that he was prejudiced by this unconstituted -- unconstitutional grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.370" offset="3932871">Then, to cover another point, they had the case of Smith versus State.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.262" offset="3956381">These all happen within a period of three or four days, as they implemented this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.689" offset="3982085">It was held that there could be an intelligent and knowingly waiver of the defects in an indictment or conviction by such an improperly constituted grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.508" offset="4033390">This meant that someone, if they saw fit, they could waive that constitutionally invalid grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.276" offset="4072469">Then, in -- the fourth case that came up at this time was Hayes versus Wainwright vers -- Hayes and Wainwright versus State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.540" offset="4113533">The question here was, did someone have to raise this point in the lower Court to have it considered by the Court of Appeals of Maryland?</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.881" offset="4150941">And, the Court of Appeals held that it wasn't necessary that they raise the invalidity of the grand jury in the lower Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.856" offset="4182810">They all could have benefit of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.993" offset="4195349">Now, in that framework, the Court of Appeals of Maryland went forth and set up guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.605" offset="4229831">They remanded approximately 221 cases, which is an exact figure form their records, that were pending in the system in the -- before the Appellate Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.113" offset="4279777">As far as the cases that were indicted, there were some filed in the classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.755" offset="4306422">They had been indicted, but they had not been tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.461" offset="4317184">Some have been indicted, had been tried, but not -- had not taken an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.445" offset="4341112">And, other ones would fall in the category that they had been tried and they were acquitted and so, they were out, as far as this constitu -- in illegally constituted grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.914" offset="4395029">Now, these are the guidelines that the Court of Appeals of Maryland set down in their notice to the lower Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.930" offset="4427107">They said that the accused was to be brought into the trial court with his counsel present to ascertain whether he desires to avail himself of the rif -- relief afforded by the ruling, and/or whether he elects to waive any objections now available to him, under this decision, the four that I've mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.215" offset="4524283">The accused -- second, the accused is to be informed of his right to attack his conviction and of the fact that the Court would vacate the indictment or a conviction if he moved them to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.231" offset="4576319">Third, the accused is to be advised that he is subject to re-indictment and trial if he elects not to abide by his present status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.415" offset="4621040">Four, the accused should likewise be advised that if he'd be reconvicted of any new sentence to be imposed, any new sentence to be imposed might be greater or less than the one or ones presently against him within the maximum limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.126" offset="4691884">Five, the accused is to be told that he can waive any defects in the grand or petty jury which indicted or convicted him, notwithstanding the unlawful composition of that jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.199" offset="4744129">And, last, if the accused selects to accept the indictment or trial jury as valid and that -- the appeal will proceed to the Court of Appeals in the usual way on the grounds of bear change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.009" offset="4791359">Now, Mr. Benton was brought into the Court in Prince George's County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.294" offset="4820511">He was advised of these rights in the presence of his counsel and he exercised his option to declare his original indictment null and void.</text>

            <text syncTime="2526.700" offset="10210200">The same evidence that was produced to approve the burglary charge proved the larceny charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="2584.203" offset="10440182">May I please attempt to clear up one area?</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.336" offset="10456691">The import of the state's argument is that the petitioner knew precisely what he was doing on the remand proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.840" offset="10486784">However, the material cited to this Court by the respondent refutes his argument rather than supports it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.924" offset="10523042">On page 21 and 22 of, the respondent, State of Maryland's brief, there are cited six questions that were to be asked of the petitioner on the remand proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.238" offset="10580302">The Court will note that, among the six questions, there is no question, do you realize, that if you elect to be retried, your previous indictment may be revived and you may be charged again on all matters even those of which you were preciously acquitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.524" offset="10657520">There is nothing in this record to support that, not specifically and not inferentially.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.402" offset="10688972">In effect, the State of Maryland asked this Court to believe that, on the remand proceedings, the petitioner would anticipate that the state would violate the most basic principles of double jeopardy, and I think it's wrong to believe that a defendant will anticipate that the state will do wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.573" offset="10785625">Furthermore, on page -- and lastly, on page 2 and 3 of the joint appendix, we note on page 2 that the defendant challenges the array of the grand jury on June 30, 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.934" offset="10855111">On page 3, we note that his trial was on August 11, 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.630" offset="10885935">It's reasonable to infer from this that the first time he knew that he would be charged again on the case on which he was previously acquitted was more than two months after he made his so-called election.</text>
