            <label>Mr. Marvin M. Karpatkin</label>
            <text syncTime="38.059" offset="255561">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.838" offset="274683">The essential question of this case concerns the right of a convicted serviceman to a meaningful appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.713" offset="310209">More specifically, it concerns the power of a military commander to order the immediate confinement of a serviceman convicted by general court-martial and sentenced to a bad conduct dismissal from the service or confinement of one year or more and in title thereby to certain valuable appellate rights to sentence -- to order his immediate confinement not withstanding the explicit provision of Article 71 (c) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice which prohibits execution of such sentences prior to the completion of military appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.050" offset="443538">Under the existing practice of confinement, pending completion of appellate review, the entire sentence may be served prior to final appellate action and the guaranteed right of appeal from serious convictions in the military will be rendered meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.470" offset="505292">The military and the Government assert this power on the basis of an overstrained conceptual distinction between confinement, pending completion of review and confinement after final approval of sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.376" offset="556910">This right is asserted further in violation of military law without regard to whether or not confinement is necessary to ensure the prisoner's presence after completion of appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.039" offset="603512">This is a habeas corpus case and it presents the question of a power to confine a military prisoner prior to the completion of military review in two contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.387" offset="640920">First, the power to confine him at the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, a maximum security institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.671" offset="670072">And second, the power to confine in a unique status of confinement at Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico which was especially devised with petitioner after an order attempting to transfer him for confinement of Leavenworth was declared unlawful by the district judge in New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.513" offset="733393">There is however a threshold question of habeas corpus jurisdiction raised by the Tenth Circuit's reversal of the District Court on grounds of alleged failure to exhaust military remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.550" offset="785533">After the decision of the Tenth Circuit when certiorari application was pending in this Court, an application was made to the Circuit Justice for release from confinement pending certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.059" offset="831613">It was denied first by the Circuit Justice, further application was made in Mr. Justice Douglas and it was granted on December 24, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.602" offset="861811">In his order, granting the application for release from confinement pending certiorari, Mr. Justice Douglas specified two issues related to exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.336" offset="900681">First, whether the doctrine of exhaustion of military remedies applies where the habeas corpus petitioner does not challenge any purported error in the court-martial proceedings themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.574" offset="941641">But rather whether the question -- where the question is whether the court-martial convening authority, in this case, the respondent General Bond acted beyond his jurisdiction in attempting to order confinement prior to completion of military appellate review and violation of Article 71 (c) UCMJ.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.077" offset="1011649">Also specified by Mr. Justice Douglas in his opinion is the question of the respective scope of review by the Court of Military Appeals and the federal courts on military habeas corpus applications of this nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.872" offset="1066820">It is necessary to state the facts a bit, may it please the Court in order to indicate the dimensions of the problems involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.977" offset="1099316">Petitioner, a captain in the Air Force was convicted by a general court-martial at Cannon Air Force Base in New Mexico on March 8, 1968 for violation of Article 90 of the UCMJ.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.180" offset="1144142">He was accused and convicted of willful disobedience of a lawful order.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.769" offset="1158457">The order he was convicted of violating was that he fly an instructional mission with the student pilot being trained for combat duty in Vietnam.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.585" offset="1189700">The principle defense which was sought to be raised of general court-martial was that he had previously applied for classification as a conscientious objector and either separation from the service or reassignment to duties not inconsistent with this conscience that his application was denied because of an error of law on the part of the Secretary of the Air Force and those officers acting in the name of the Secretary of the Air Force.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.918" offset="1279039">The error which was alleged was the secretary's denial of a claim because Captain Noyd was a selective conscientious objector and not a universal pacifist.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.282" offset="1320521">I must observed that even though this issue wasn't before the Court that this is not a wholly frivolous contention as demonstrated by the recent decision of Judge Wyzanski in the Sisson case in the District of Massachusetts which I understand the Solicitor General was taking a direct appeal on to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.352" offset="1380812">However, petitioner was unable to raise that defense that is general court-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.180" offset="1396067">The law officer held that the general court-martial was without jurisdiction and the board of review which heard the first appeal from the conviction specifically held that only federal courts had jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.526" offset="1441520">The case is now pending in the Court of Military Appeals and will be argued sometime next month.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.586" offset="1461687">The criminal proceedings at the general court-martial and the futile attempt to appeal there from where Captain Noyd second unsuccessful attempt to obtain judicial review on whether the secretary's denial of his conscientious objector application was lawful or unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.521" offset="1521455">The prior attempt was in the case of Noyd against McNamara where the District Court of Colorado and the Tenth Circuit held without reaching the merits that they were jurisdictionally barred from ruling because again the doctrine of exhaustion of military remedies barred them, they so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.097" offset="1591777">And they stated further and the Government so argued before those courts that whether the application for conscientious objection was rightfully or wrongfully denied could not be judicially reviewed in the civilian courts but only as a defense to a court-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.472" offset="1657292">And involving as it does the necessity of disobeying an order and raising the issue was wrongful denial.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.056" offset="1679548">Certiorari was denied by this Court in Noyd against McNamara in December of 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.637" offset="1701909">Thus, the civilian courts directed petitioner to raise his defense in the military courts and the military court said in turn that only the civilian courts had jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.263" offset="1736391">The sentence of the general court-martial imposed March 9, 1968 was for dismissal from the service total forfeiture of all pay and allowances and one year's confinement of odd labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.657" offset="1777977">On that day, the day the sentence was imposed, petitioner was ordered into immediate confinement at the quarters which he had in Cannon Air Force Base as a senior captain on the list for promotion to major from which list he was removed after he filed the CO application.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.363" offset="1836805">He was entitled to reasonably comfortable officer's residence on base with wife and two infant children.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.312" offset="1860629">On May 10, 1968, the convening authority of the general court-martial, the respondent General Bond approved the court-martial findings and sentence and ordered petitioner confined that the Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas pending the completion of appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.659" offset="1926040">The appendix contains info general court-martial order number 13 which sets forth the convening authority action.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.415" offset="1952998">The attempts to implement the convening authorities Leavenworth confinement order led to the instant proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="490.395" offset="2064906">A habeas corpus petition was filed immediately in the District Court of New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.400" offset="2080998">Judge Paine acted promptly, he should stay immediately, there was no return by the Government to the habeas corpus petition, no request for additional time in which to file a return.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.555" offset="2117569">It was argued and presented purely as a question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.247" offset="2128332">There was a hearing within a matter of days briefs and oral argument decision from the Bench on May 23rd written opinion on May 24th which is set forth in the appendix to the effect that Article 71 (c) was violated by the attempted confinement of petitioner at the Disciplinary Barracks of Fort Leavenworth.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.373" offset="2192906">However, Judge Paine declined to order complete release from petitioner's then status of arrest in his residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.600" offset="2221746">Both sides appeal to the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.088" offset="2231672">Early in June of 1968 while the appeal was pending, petitioner and his family were evicted from their residence and special conditions of confinement was setup for petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.317" offset="2272632">He was ordered to move to a room specially prepared for him and the visiting officers quarters and conditions were established which I can best characterize as being a hybrid having certain characteristics of arrest, certain characteristics of imprisonment, and certain characteristics of solitary confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.266" offset="2340446">It was arrest in that or at least had resembled arrest in that and there was no lock on his door and he was allowed use of the telephone or TV set of his expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.614" offset="2373778">It was imprisonment and that all of his activities were strictly regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.896" offset="2386944">He was subject to surveillance by Air Force Security Police, permitted to leave his room for meals, chapel or laundry but only under condition similar to those where by a penitentiary prisoner could leave his cell to obtain these services elsewhere in the penitentiary complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.155" offset="2452041">However, it also had certain attributes of solitary confinement and that posted on his door was a huge sign “Room off limits to military personnel.”</text>
            <text syncTime="596.005" offset="2487359">He was not permitted to have exercise except for one and a half hours per week with an approved officer and denied the opportunity of contact with other human beings, fellow prisoners or otherwise which even inmates of the Disciplinary Barracks unless they are in solitary confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.798" offset="2546604">This unique hybrid status continued from June of 1968 to December 24, 1968 when he was ordered release from confinement by order of Mr. Justice Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.752" offset="2590386">In the interim, the board of review affirmed the court-martial conviction and the Tenth Circuit reversed the District Court of New Mexico in this habeas corpus proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.891" offset="2630928">The Tenth Circuit did not consider the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.110" offset="2639809">We respectfully suggest by the citation of cases in footnote 4 of its opinion which is printed in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.926" offset="2663111">It appears to agree with petitioner's position that 71 (c) was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.137" offset="2679933">The Tenth Circuit held however that it was jurisdictionally barred from ruling once again because of the doctrine of exhaustion of military remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="730.267" offset="3024436">All that I can say to that Your Honor is that they appears to be nothing specific in Air Force regulations on that point and it required a specific rulings form the Judge Advocate General.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.825" offset="3062680">Consequently, because of the possibility that the sentence would expire with good time allowance prior to this Court's action on the certiorari petition, it was accompanied by release application to avoid the possibility of mootness and I stated before Mr. Justice Douglas on December 24, 1968 granted the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.614" offset="3145853">In response to the certiorari petition however, the Government submitted a memorandum suggesting mootness and then a further supplemental memorandum further arguing mootness and said, nothing whatsoever in our position to the merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.075" offset="3195695">However, on January 20, 1969, certiorari was granted and Mr. Justice Douglas' stay order was specifically continued by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.282" offset="3228505">Now, it is hard to tell if the Government's continuing to seriously present mootness argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.067" offset="3247626">It first seemed to argue in the two memoranda which were submitted and Mr. Justice Douglas was without power to interrupt the termination of the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.214" offset="3276257">Now, apparently it concedes that Mr. Justice Douglas had the power but it argues what that it is unclear whether Mr. Justice Douglas intended to interrupt the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.742" offset="3314291">With all due respect I suggest that argument is fatuous.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.665" offset="3325994">Petition is concerned about mootness was made very, very clear and the release applications presented at first to Mr. Justice White and later to Mr. Justice Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.858" offset="3362774">And obviously, the members of the Court who read it were aware of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.558" offset="3377612">Now, in the brief presented in this Court, the Government position is somewhat schizophrenic.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.509" offset="3397360">One place saying that it is moot, in other place saying maybe it isn't moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.484" offset="3413347">And then finally, concluding saying it's all up to what Mr. Justice Douglas intended and then there is a reference to the decision of this Court in I. L. A. against Philadelphia Marine Trade which reversed the contempt order because in accordance with the decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.271" offset="3464443">It was unintelligible, too vague to be understood and defies comprehension.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.868" offset="3482833">I respectfully suggest that this characterization to Mr. Justice Douglas is ordered by the Government is completely uncalled for.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.796" offset="3510523">If I may reach the preliminary question in this case, the question of exhaustion of military remedies, the Court of Appeals denied relief we hold improperly on grounds of the legislative exhaust military remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.427" offset="3565066">The decision of the Tenth Circuit was based on one decision of this Court, Gusik against Schilder in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.673" offset="3594115">I have not been able to find the single instance where the doctrine of Gusik and so many words has been reaffirmed by this Court since then and it has apparently however been held inapplicable in military habeas corpus cases which do not attack court-martial proceedings per se but rather question military jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="985.643" offset="4045928">The Article 97 -- paragraph 97 (c) of the manual for court-martial which appears in our brief sets forth a series of circumstances where a sentence is considered suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.357" offset="4112802">And there are -- it is evident from the text of the language itself that these were not intended to be an exclusive cataloging.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.741" offset="4154284">97 (c), Mr. Justice Fortas, is on pages 6 and 7 of petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.392" offset="4180929">Now, one of the specifications in this concededly none exhaustive listing is period during which the person undergoing such a sentence is erroneously released from confinement upon his petition for writ of habeas corpus under a court order which is later reversed by competent tribunal shall be excluded in computing the service of the time of the punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.295" offset="4300570">The -- if I may proceed with the argument on exhaustion, the -- there is great significance here in the decision of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia affirmed by this Court and the case of United States ex rel. Guagliardo against McElroy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.398" offset="4369011">It was specifically held there that the rule of exhaustion does not apply where military jurisdiction is challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.394" offset="4400985">Petitioner in this case is not making a habeas corpus attack on the many errors which he believes occurred in the court-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.285" offset="4428466">He is content to exhaust all of his military remedies for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.219" offset="4444244">Habeas corpus here is sought so that if the errors are redress on appeal he will not have been deprived to that redress by intervening confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.663" offset="4477994">When the convening authority, the respondent General Bond attempted to confine Captain Noyd in violation of Article 71 (c), we contend that he acted beyond his jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.632" offset="4517909">He certainly had jurisdiction to convene a court-martial to try Captain Noyd.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.997" offset="4535359">He had jurisdiction to confine him if the determination was made that it restraint was necessary to insure his presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.618" offset="4561795">He had jurisdiction to confine him after completion of appellate review but he was totally devoid of jurisdiction to confine prior to the completion of appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.534" offset="4605471">If I may respectfully suggest the entire doctrine of exhaustion of remedies are subject to continuing reexamination these days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.771" offset="4634415">Because of it sometimes wouldn't application causes rendering -- renders the right remediless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.619" offset="4661896">As this Court observed in the case of NLRB against Marine Workers as a result of the region application of the doctrines sometimes the litigant becomes exhausted instead of the remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.802" offset="4698572">Our brief cites large number of cases where courts have not required an exhaustion where one, the imposer of sanctions acted beyond his jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.869" offset="4742875">Two, the administrative remedy or the remedy which is said one should exhaust is inadequate where the delay of the exhaustion process would cause irreparable injury or where the attempted exhaustion would be a futility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.431" offset="4793135">Indeed, if I may respectfully suggest further that perhaps the entire doctrine of exhaustion of remedies arose and an administrative of law context and an error at 20, 30, 40 years ago when there was an atmosphere of administrative omnipotence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.811" offset="4850604">Our feeling, I believe communicated to me impart when I went to law school that all of the nation's problems could be solved by administrative agencies and the administrative process and let's keep the courts out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.745" offset="4890311">But now on a sober second look, the courts are increasingly recognizing and this Court that the judicially developed doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies very often causes injustice and must be disregarded where it would cause in justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.540" offset="4949556">With specific reference to the suggested remedies by the -- in the opinion of the court below, it was first suggested that perhaps the normal appellate process should be use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.751" offset="4990412">For the normal appellate process in this case would obviously been ineffective because of a laps of many months between conviction and appellate decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.633" offset="5021863">We cited in our brief a number of cases where that was in fact the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.057" offset="5035551">And I cited that just on a review generally of one volume of a court-martial reports many cases where found where the Court of Military Appeals reverses the conviction only to find that the entire time of confinement has already been served.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.271" offset="5096469">Well, it was suggested that an extraordinary writ application should be made to the Court of Military Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.473" offset="5117262">We suggest that this is an inappropriate for number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.345" offset="5128756">First, of all the Court of Military Appeals which only recognize that it had such jurisdiction within the last year or so would have an extraordinary strain placed on its facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.475" offset="5173269">It's a three-judge appellate tribunal sitting in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.417" offset="5185076">It can handle only a handful of the cases that are presented to it for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.296" offset="5200541">If it was the court of original and exclusive jurisdiction of military habeas corpus applications for more than 100 federal districts in the territorial United States and in the states which are -- and of the States of Alaska and Hawaii and the territories and possessions as well that will be just impossible for the Court of Military Appeals to handle such a law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.886" offset="5278908">Furthermore, the nature of habeas corpus as this Court instructed in Johnson against Eisentrager requires the personal presence of the individual of the habeas hearing would obviously be impracticable to place upon the military of this requirement of producing a military prisoner in Washington whenever an application -- a petition for writ is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.311" offset="5352573">Also, there will be grave difficulties in the face of military prisoners attempting to secure counsel to represent them and if the only place they can appear is the Court in Washington DC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.750" offset="5390399">It's hard enough for a serviceman to get an attorney willing to bring a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the federal district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.590" offset="5413700">It will be well impossible to find one ready willing, able, financially equipped to come to Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.202" offset="5440136">Then with respect some mention maybe made of the hesitant quality of the practice of the Court of Military Appeals on extraordinary writ applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.831" offset="5470647">Although, it has asserted that it has the right that is most significant that it is not yet found the occasion to exercise it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.970" offset="5507218">Obviously, the evolution of a new jurisdictional base takes time and it's only to be welcome that the Court of Military Appeals is asserted that it has its right but it would certainly be ineffective and impracticable to say that if this time in history, the Court of Military Appeals stands ready to listen to and grant relief and habeas corpus applications from military prisoners all over the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.570" offset="5605648">I might further say that the Tenth Circuit's narrow jurisdictional position requiring exhaustion of every conceivable military remedy has caused an apparent conflict between the circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.381" offset="5648906">The decisions of the Tenth Circuit in Noyd against McNamara and Noyd against Bond which refuse to consider the merits because of the doctrine of exhaustion of military remedies are directly contrary to the decisions of the Second Circuit and the Fifth Circuit and the Third Circuit which we cite in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.915" offset="5711078">Furthermore, there are large number of cases which the Government does not in anyway seek to explain where federal courts on habeas applications did not require application to the Court of Military Appeals but ruled on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.292" offset="5760502">The Government's position likewise cast doubt on the recognized practice of utilizing habeas corpus without any requirement of exhaustion in the Court of Military Appeals to test the validity of the induction order and also the validity of an in-service denial of conscientious objector claims for draftees as well as for enlistees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.176" offset="5836048">Finally, if I may turn to the merits of this case which I respectfully suggest present as clearer cases as we say in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.139" offset="5871888">Has there been a violation of Article 71 (c) in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.806" offset="5890591">It might first be observed that we are not attacking the military process, we're not attacking the military appellate process by any means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.354" offset="5920789">Indeed, we regard ourselves as the champions of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.252" offset="5932387">Our position supports the integrity of the military appellate process for if a commanding officer can effect a de facto execution of a one year prison sentence prior to the completion of the military appellate process in direct violation of an act of Congress, the integrity of the appellate process is serious we compromise if not destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.421" offset="6017024">Our brief traces the development of the military appellate process from the Articles of War, the UCMJ in 1951 and suggest that one of the essential elements in the development of greater rights for the serviceman is the development of further and more refined appellate jurisdiction that the history -- part of the history of increasing due process has been the providing of a gap of a space between the Court of First Instance, between the original action and final review by a higher appellate authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.223" offset="6148263">The consistent interpretation of Article 71 (c) which we have catalogue in a long list of cases in our brief does not show a single instance where the Government's argument that it can confine prior to the completion of military appellate review in the absence of necessity to secure presence and the Government cites no cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.605" offset="6225795">At the very least, Judge Paine in the District of New Mexico was right when he held that confinement of Leavenworth would in effect constitute in part at least execution of the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.547" offset="6273546">The only case contrary, the decision of the District of Kansas in Levy against Dillon is a contrary interpretation to 71 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.792" offset="6302490">It is now on appeal to the Tenth Circuit, we respectfully suggest that Judge Paine was right and that the District Court of Kansas was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.806" offset="6338644">A distinction is attempted to be made by the Government between the treatment of adjudged prisoners whose sentences have not been finally approved and sentenced prisoners whose sentences have been finally approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.160" offset="6383992">But we respectfully suggest that the Air Force manual for the guidance of prisoners, the manual applicable to the Institution of the Disciplinary Barracks shows no significant difference whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.809" offset="6442611">No difference in treatment of male all of which is subject to opening an inspection, I respectfully suggest there's an error in the footnote in the Government's brief, no differences in uniform regulations, no differences with regard to visiting, no differences with regard to library privileges and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.335" offset="6504678">It is suggested that there is one difference and that adjudged prisoner is not compelled to work but the manual requires that they be encouraged to do and in fact most of them do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.644" offset="6541981">However, even if there is a difference in this one area, the essential characteristics of confinement in a maximum security military prisoner are applied equally to adjudged and sentenced prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.592" offset="6581791">There are bars in the windows, there is control of hours of meals, sleep and all other activities, constant surveillance by armed guards, restriction of reading matter, restriction of visitors and the whole host of other specifications in the Leavenworth Manual which we cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.119" offset="6639888">I'll save what time I have remaining for rebuttal, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1647.579" offset="6693700">Captain Noyd's Air Force career has in fact given rise to a number of difficult questions about the Government and regulation of the Armed Forces.</text>

            <text syncTime="1667.259" offset="6772381">His principle claim concerning the alleged impropriety and the denial of conscientious objector status to him is now before the Court of Military Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.642" offset="6817938">It may well return to the civil courts and it may well return here but those questions are not involved in the case that is here now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.695" offset="6854196">In contrast, this case involves at bottom what is a rather narrow and highly technical question of military penology.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.244" offset="6892335">The nature of the restraints that the Uniform Code of Military Justice permits the military to put upon a serviceman after a court-martial conviction and while he's in the process of exhausting his military rights to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.835" offset="6946670">Fortuitously, this case comes here with Captain Noyd as the defendant but it might as well have been a more conventional serviceman charged for the routine military offense and of course it's important to recognize that the legal principles for which the petitioners arguing here are principles that would apply across the board in military cases to any military defendant whether he was charged with desertion or murder or any other crime that could appropriately be tried by a court-martial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2317.631" offset="9373863">Yes, and of course that is the basis of our mootness argument that confinement and service are in this peculiar code we're dealing with different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.402" offset="9433004">We have also urged that the Court of Appeals was right in creating the merits of Captain Noyd's claim is improperly before the civil courts because of his failure to exhaust the remedy in the military courts that was clearly available to him at the time that he came to the civil courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.934" offset="9527150">This is an important point, it's one I would like to return to but I think perhaps it would be helpful if I discuss the merits even though we have two reasons for saying why the merits should not be reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.906" offset="9571035">I think it perhaps it will put the case and better focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.337" offset="9592769">Mr. Karpatkin's argument, at least orally, rests largely upon his interpretation of Article 71 (c) of the Code which is the provision that prohibits the execution of a sentence until it has been completely reviewed by the military courts and in the case of an officer such as Captain Noyd by the Service Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.867" offset="9698826">He says that for this reason the order directing that Captain Noyd be sent to the special officer facilities at for Leavenworth was an improper order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.877" offset="9758908">I think the first thing that should be said about that is that whatever else may be moot in this case certainly the order sending Captain Noyd purporting to send Captain Noyd to Leavenworth is now moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.918" offset="9811048">The regulations that govern such matters make it clear that no man can be sent to a Disciplinary Barracks unless he has six months remaining to serve on his sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.469" offset="9853262">Now, even if this case is not moot, it appears to be a great that there are only two days left.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.554" offset="9873638">So, for that reason, I think that the Leavenworth order which has been suspended is ever since it was shortly after was issued by the order of the District Court and to stay by the Tenth Circuit of its mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.747" offset="9938317">I would suggest that that order is not as a practical matter in issue in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2503.118" offset="10115845">No, it's simply by operation of the Court's Order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.076" offset="10135698">In any event, we would suggest as we point out in our brief that the District Court's disposition of the Leavenworth order reflected either a misunderstanding again of what is highly technical provision in the military law as to what execution is or else perhaps in this matter is not discussed very in much detail in the District Court's opinion, a misunderstanding of the nature of the confinement to which Captain Noyd would have been subjected had he been at Leavenworth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.131" offset="10271848">There are in fact separate facilities with very separate treatment for officers awaiting appeal, they're very separate and different from the facilities and treatment they are given to regular prisoners at Leavenworth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.729" offset="10334333">It has been the standard practice to send so-called adjudged officers awaiting appeal to Leavenworth rather than retaining them at their basis because of the special problems that the status of an officer creates with respect to restraints on his base.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.978" offset="10407267">This has been upheld in the case of Captain Levy and we submit that it was not an abuse of discretion or an execution the sentence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.168" offset="10452093">But as I've said, I don't think we have to reach the Leavenworth order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.177" offset="10480097">So that reduces the case on the merits if the merit should've been reached to the petitioner's claim that the restraint to which he was subjected at Cannon Air Force Base where he has been stationed at the pertinent times exceeded what the Uniform Code of Military Justice permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.700" offset="10570167">I believe it's accurate to say that the petitioner concedes that some restraint of a convicted person and convicted officer while his appeal pending is permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.979" offset="10615306">So the real question here is whether the restraint that was imposed upon Captain Noyd by his arrest in quarters was a proper restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.135" offset="10671940">The answer to at least to the legal principles that govern the question of the restraint that is allowed require the locating and interpreting of a number of different provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the manual for courts-martial which of course is an executive order technically of the President and of course has the force of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.116" offset="10767862">It is -- the manual is promulgated by the President under a provision of the Uniform Code, Article 36 which is somewhat like the rules enabling act that has permitted this Court to promulgate the rules of civil and criminal procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.470" offset="10841213">It's the direction of the president to provide for the procedure in cases before courts-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.080" offset="10867649">Now, there is nothing in the Code itself, the statutory code we submit that that speaks expressly to the question of restraint of a convicted prisoner or convicted individual while his appeal is pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.978" offset="10931284">But there are certain provisions in the manual which do speak directly to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.158" offset="10963989">First, is Article -- is paragraph 21 (d) of the manual which provides that upon notification of the result of a court-martial trial the commanding officer of the defendant in that trial will take prompt and appropriate action with respect to the restraint of the person tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.950" offset="11043192">Such action, and I continue to quote, “depending upon the circumstances may involve the immediate release of the person from any restraint or the imposition of any necessary restraint pending final action on the case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.887" offset="11098885">In its most recent statement on this question of custody pending an appeal of the Levy case some two years ago, the Court of Military Appeals held that although there is no such thing as bail in the sense that we understand it in the military system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.614" offset="11165863">This section of the manual does give the commanding officer of the defendant a discretion to determine what custody if any custody is appropriate following the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.207" offset="11204211">And the Court of Military Appeals in that Levy case although it denied Captain Levy release made it very clear that it would review the exercise of that discretion by the commanding officer involved in each case that brought to it on habeas corpus and would reverse the commander's action if the discretion was abused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.011" offset="11283414">The first step of review of a court-martial conviction is -- has been indicated approval by the commanding -- by the convening authority, in this case the Commander of the Twelfth Air Force General Bond and there are provisions -- there's a provision relating to restraint following this stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.597" offset="11365752">And that provision is paragraph 89 (c) of the manual for courts-martial that directs the convening authority to “provide in his action for the temporary custody of the accused pending final disposition of the case upon further appellate review and that further review is review by the Board of Review which has taken place in this case and by the Court of Military Appeals, the civilian court -- a court with civilian members which action is still pending in Captain Noyd's case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.927" offset="11491035">One other provision of the manual relates to custody pending appeal and that is paragraph 18 (b) (3) of the manual which provides that no punishment other than restraint imposed in accordance with regulations may be imposed upon an accused while his appeal is pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.321" offset="11584658">We think it is clear as the Court of Military Appeals has held that these provisions of the manual issued by the President pursuant to statutory authority provide a basis for appropriate restraint pending a military appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.312" offset="11660622">Now, petitioner contends that a provision of the code does in fact relate to this Article 13 which says that the arrest or confinement of a person “being held for trial or the result of trial may not be any more rigorous than the circumstance required to insure his presence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.721" offset="11754245">He interprets the result of trial to include appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.866" offset="11770859">This, we think is wrong if nothing else in light of the caption of that article Uniform Code of Military Justice which says punishment prohibited before trial and in fact there are other places in the manual whether it was made clear that the result of the trial means what in common sense term you would think it was me the result of the trial proceeding itself not the further steps of appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3769.926" offset="15183078">I should first observe that I was -- I believe reliably informed by responsible officer in the Judge Advocate General's Department of the Air Force that the Air Force still regards the Leavenworth Order as in effect and that they are not and that they do not believe that they are limited by the six-month proviso for service of the -- for service of time at Leavenworth because it applies from the day of the issuance of the order.</text>

            <text syncTime="3803.163" offset="15315989">Yes, the -- I'm surprised that the Solicitor General's recent statement because it seems to be in direct conflict with words in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3813.110" offset="15355800">Referring to two decisions of the Court of Military Appeals, the cases of Teague and (Inaudible) on page 52 of the Government's brief while those cases do find express statutory support in Article 13 for imposing conviction restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3827.439" offset="15413164">They do not hold that the permissible grounds for pretrial restraints are also the only justification for post-trial restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3833.263" offset="15436466">I believe he's coming to this Court now and making a completely different argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.180" offset="15448064">Now, he says it provides no basis whatsoever for post-conviction restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3840.262" offset="15464469">I think that what we have here is an assertion by the Government of raw naked power to imprison a convicted prisoner prior to the completion of his appellate process without stating any justification whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3855.919" offset="15527058">There was no return to the petition for the writ here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3859.444" offset="15541164">There was no statement by the Government of any desire to present evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3862.446" offset="15553181">No attempt was made to show that the conditions of Captain Noyd's confinement at any time either at Leavenworth or anywhere else were necessary to insure his presence of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3872.891" offset="15594977">The civilian cases which are cited in the Solicitor General's brief involved an addition to insuring presence of trial where an appeal was frivolous or dilatory or like in the Carbo case where the substantial probability of danger to witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3885.345" offset="15644714">Now, surely nothing like that is even remotely involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3888.161" offset="15655999">The Government in effect concedes that no such showing could be made and indeed no such showing could be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3893.475" offset="15677315">The prosecutor at the trial and everybody involved in Captain Noyd's tortuous legal proceedings have considered from beginning to the end his excellent character and sincerity and that there is no danger of his doing anything of the nature of flight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3906.381" offset="15728933">In essence, I respectfully suggest the Government is arguing that there was a right to preventative detention under these circumstances even without any showing that the detention is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3916.245" offset="15768325">The Government is arguing that there was a right to punish without an offense being committed, without any charge, without any trial and without any conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3923.922" offset="15799045">I respectfully suggest that this process which is apparently been going on in the military for many years where just automatically somebody has sent off to jail as soon he's convicted regardless of his appeals that finally a case involving this issue has reached this Honorable Court and that this I respectfully suggest is the appropriate time for this Court to advise the military and to advise the population that not only can the military not violate the Constitution but they certainly cannot violate their own Uniform Code of Military Justice which apparently they have been flagrantly doing for the last 15 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.728" offset="15930284">Thank you very much.</text>
