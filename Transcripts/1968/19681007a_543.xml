            <label>Mr. David J. Young</label>
            <text syncTime="65.764" offset="369497">First of all, the appellants would like to express their appreciation to the Court for the dispatch and vigilance with which they have scheduled this case, the case that may very well need additional remedial relief to protect the most basic of all of our rights in society, the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.540" offset="472628">We recognized that this has been an inconvenience to the Court but we are grateful that we have scheduled the case so expeditiously.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.126" offset="510976">We place this case before the Court in urging fashion because we believe that the integrity of the 1968 presidential election is at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.637" offset="568968">We believe that the transcript evidence before the Court amply demonstrates that plaintiff's candidate Governor Wallace has sufficient voter support in Ohio that his chances of carrying that state are very substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.990" offset="642424">We -- the transcript evidence shows polls that were taken and they were placed before the lower court and each of the answers to those polls was prefaced on the condition that if Governor Wallace's name appears on the ballot they would vote for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.993" offset="722463">On the other hand, it would appear to us and from the evidence in the transcript that if the plaintiffs in this case are relegated to the federal court relief of write-in status, this Governor Wallace's name is taken off the ballot in Ohio that his supporters in that state might as well forget about those 26 electoral votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.495" offset="812429">Thus, we appear before the Court today seeking relief that's not only essential to the protection of the equal protection of the law rights of the voters in Ohio of the candidates of the minor political parties but also a protection of the integrity of this presidential election and an order which will convince at least 452,000 voters in Ohio that they cannot be fenced out of the democratic elective process simply because their views do not agree with the views of the majority party.</text>

            <label>Mr. David J. Young</label>
            <text syncTime="332.098" offset="1434875">Not and of itself, no and perhaps I might get ahead of myself and explain why.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.841" offset="1457758">I think that a very significant aspect of the inadequacy of the relief afforded by the lower court in this case is demonstrated when one reviews the election laws in Ohio and their relationship to the methods of write-in voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.765" offset="1529543">In Ohio, we have an excess of 13,000 precincts of with polling places.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.225" offset="1563293">The elections of such are governed by the 88 counties in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.250" offset="1583459">Each clerk of the Board of Elections then and that Board of Elections selects the voting method that he feels would best suit his county's conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.073" offset="1622747">Now, the problem is that there are five different voting methods scattered throughout the state of Ohio in this 88 counties and 13,000 precincts may review them just real quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.296" offset="1667678">First of all, the basic paper ballot and of course the difficulties of a write-in, statewide write-in campaign aren't too great with that ballot because that simply has an extra space and rather than checking the space with the name on it; one writes in the name in the extra space and then checks it.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.239" offset="1743433">Moving from there however, we move to what we call the synthesized paper ballot that is used in the county -- Hamilton County with the third largest country in the State of Ohio with City of Cincinnati in that county.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.620" offset="1796932">They used a synthesized ballot the record shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.074" offset="1810725">It's a punch card that has four holes on the pointers of that synthesized ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.258" offset="1835489">In order to -- now, the reason I have those are these are counted at the Secretary of State's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.318" offset="1851685">They are transported to the Secretary of State put on the machine and they push a button and just all go down to the machine and the synthesized votes are recorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.309" offset="1887629">Now, when a voter in Ohio would approach the booth to use that kind of a voting device, he would be given a cigar or lighter kind of apparatus that he would stamp his choice for the name of the candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.313" offset="1943740">And on this stamp makes the marking that's recorded in this machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.532" offset="1968609">If he wanted to write in, he couldn't use this apparatus.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.019" offset="1978535">It writes too large.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.496" offset="1988462">There would be pencils available.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.452" offset="2000269">Now, if you pick up the pencil first and started to write in, there's no written instructions in the booth or on the card to show that the pencil would not record any of the votes for all of the other candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.649" offset="2044991">So, if he -- he couldn't use the cigar lighter-kind of apparatus to write in, he couldn't use the pencil to mark the other ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.429" offset="2076129">The only way of voter in Ohio in this election would know what to do would have to be asked the voting officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.315" offset="2103714">So, this is going to -- and then of course they'll have to call out all of the synthesized cards with any writing on them and count them twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.629" offset="2144987">From those two methods, we move to the three voting machine methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.770" offset="2161497">The first one as the record demonstrates is the Shupe (ph) method which probably is the easiest to use in write-in situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.440" offset="2192217">It is the voting machine that has the offices listed vertically in to the left and then the candidates to the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.727" offset="2229311">It's quite simple to use the write-in process in those because the little door that you lift up to find the paper is just to the left of the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.975" offset="2258359">And so you just go over then write-in but the more frequently used automatic voting machine has its candidates and officers horizontally across the top and it has a little box some place else where you have to lift up doors to find the place to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.298" offset="2323665">You have to correlate a number that's attributed to a specific office and go up some place else on the machine and lift up a door that relates to that number and then write-in your vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.883" offset="2373925">For this particular year, there's a major problem the little slants where you write-in slant in this direction for a right hand voter and a left handed voter would almost have to stand on his head to get up and write-in on that space.</text>

            <text syncTime="609.066" offset="2542676">A voter picks up an IBM card, this is later counted by an IBM machine and he puts this IBM card into this tabulating -- into this marking apparatus, a glass plate fits over it and it magnifies the markings on this ballot and then you go through and turn the card around and then when you get to the office that you want to vote for you punch it and it makes a mark on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.031" offset="2642568">In order to write-in, you have to get that card out of the machine and get it back down and write.</text>

            <text syncTime="1456.685" offset="5933160">Now, I did not include in my reply brief but on the day that I had to file it I called opposing counsel and noted that with reference to that argument I should've cited one case by this Court which I feel comes closes to answering that particular contention and I gave the citation to counsel last Friday and that's the case of Katzenbach versus Morgan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.425" offset="6012155">The Court will recall this was the New York case where the State of New York was attempting to uphold its literary test -- literacy test requirement as a qualification to voting and as against the federal legislation the Voting Rights Act which stated that if one attended Puerto Rican schools and went to sixth grade and wasn't taught English that they could not be barred from voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.087" offset="6106823">Now, one of the arguments presented in that case was the fact that the State of New York by reason of direct constitutional grant, United States constitutional grant had the power to establish qualifications of voters in election for United States -- members of the United States House of Representative and United States Senators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.297" offset="6195639">So in another words, in this instance, the state like a state would be doing it if we're appointing electors was doing exactly what the United States Constitution told it to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.597" offset="6236808">And I have this real brief little quote here that I think comes very close to answering this requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.684" offset="6261154">It starts up by recognizing under the distribution of powers affected by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.207" offset="6283306">The state established qualifications for voting for state officers and the qualifications established by the states for voting for members of the most numerous branch of the state legislature also determined who may vote for United States Representatives and Senators and then cites some authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.369" offset="6347880">But of course, the states have no power to grant or withhold the franchise on conditions that are forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment or any other provisions of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.807" offset="6389676">Such exercises of state power are no more immune to the limitations of the Fourteenth Amendment than any other state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.826" offset="6417784">Now, as I read that this Court is saying that regardless of the source of whether the state is regulating the qualifications simply by reason of the reserved powers in the state in the Constitution or because of some constitutional grant of authority like they were doing in the Katzenbach case but still that the restraints of the Fourteenth Amendment still apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="2384.224" offset="9643384">First of all, demonstrate the unconstitutionality of the legislation as being challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.526" offset="9660520">And secondly, demonstrate by reason of principles of equity that the Court should grant equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.250" offset="9683404">Now, if a party came before the three-judge District Court in Ohio and said, we have one member and we don't want any more members and then one came in with 450,000 signatories on a petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.434" offset="9740142">It seems to us that a court of equity could make a distinction on these grounds as Justice -- Judge Kinneary did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.774" offset="9773578">His distinction was that this party has demonstrated that it has sufficient voter straight can be any constitutionally permissible number figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.668" offset="9809105">He did not find that the other party had demonstrated that it could meet constitutionally permissible standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.683" offset="9829167">Then, the Court of Equity must decide and take it the clearer case the one man party in the 450,000 is at state law that kept this one man party off the ballot or is it just the mere fact that they aren't large enough to be on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.041" offset="9882561">So, it seems to me that once you concede reasonable number's regulations then it seems to me you get to the proposition that in plaintiffs coming before Court of Equity and asking equitable relief that a judge will look to their strength and to see whether the laws themselves or would kept this party off the ballot.</text>

            <text syncTime="4487.135" offset="18055022">We agree that the Equal Protection Clause may very well apply some limitation to the power of the state legislatures to direct the appointment, the manner of the appointment of presidential electors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4504.010" offset="18122522">We believe that that power may be limited in such a respect that the state legislatures could not disqualify anyone from being an elector on the basis of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="4517.531" offset="18176543">However, no claim has been made that the Ohio procedures violate these kinds of equal protection guarantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4526.657" offset="18213115">We do deny however that there is any limitation on the legislature's power based on the principle that electors should be chosen on the basis of popular support of candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4538.277" offset="18259508">This -- the McPherson case recognized and appellants can see that the legislature has the right to appoint electors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4545.547" offset="18288661">When the legislature does appoint directly, it cannot appoint on the basis of popular support for the simple reason it doesn't know the popular support, no election having been had.</text>
            <text syncTime="4561.809" offset="18353654">The argument is could be made however that once an election is held that some other kind of equal protection limitation suddenly appears.</text>

            <text syncTime="4640.233" offset="18667332">Nevertheless, Gray would suggest that there is some kind of limitation based on equal protection that applies to this situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="7428.104" offset="29818901">They brought suit to challenge an Ohio electoral system which completely excluded them from participating on an equal basis with the other political parties in Ohio or even an unequal basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="7441.746" offset="29873445">Their rights as a political party were in effect obliterated by a series of Ohio election laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="7449.239" offset="29903433">They challenged those laws, a declaratory judgment favorable to their position was rendered, right in voting was provided for the November 1968 General Election, ballot position was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="7462.666" offset="29957141">From that branch of the opinion denying ballot position, we appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="7467.906" offset="29978039">Socialist Labor Party of America is a national political party with roots reaching back into the 19th century.</text>
            <text syncTime="7475.446" offset="30008236">It advocates the Socialist reconstruction American society and it advocates that this be brought about to the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="7484.748" offset="30045435">It has never used any other means but peaceful constitutional means to advance it to position.</text>
            <text syncTime="7492.140" offset="30075005">Accordingly, it places great emphasize on elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="7495.249" offset="30087440">It is currently in its 20th consecutive presidential campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="7500.141" offset="30106979">In 1964 presidential elections, it was on the ballot in 16 states conducted a write-in campaign in nine others.</text>
            <text syncTime="7509.389" offset="30143969">Similarly, it has been on the ballot in Ohio going back into the 19th century.</text>
            <text syncTime="7515.318" offset="30167688">Now, the party in Ohio has modest numbers pursuant to the request of the District Court documents were submitted which show to the parties members equal in some approximately 108.</text>
            <text syncTime="7530.044" offset="30226620">These documents also show that the party distributed in single year and this is customary approximately a quarter of million of a pieces of literature leaflets.</text>

            <text syncTime="9814.676" offset="39365193">Well, because so there are many other cases such as Louisiana versus United States where the right was circumscribed by the way it was implemented by the actions of local boards of elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="9824.845" offset="39405840">And the Court has struck that down and issued decrease and in that case, incidentally the Court said that a decrease should not only prevent -- illuminate the discrimination which had existed up to that point but to prevent future discrimination as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="9838.930" offset="39462160">This is the type of decree we seek because otherwise we're getting to go back to Ohio and go to through the same -- same experience we've had before.</text>
            <text syncTime="9846.779" offset="39493611">We consider inevitable the Court has seen the resistance and hostility of these appellees and these pervades Ohio to third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="9854.874" offset="39525898">We asked for a restoration of these rights and the year 1908 in Ohio, the democratic candidate for governor got a half of million votes that republican candidate got a half of a million votes and the Socialist Labor Party got a small votes, 797 but it was on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="9868.966" offset="39582323">It didn't bankrupt Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="9870.749" offset="39589428">It's possible for small groups of people to enjoy these kind of rights and there's no reason why they shouldn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="9877.270" offset="39615551">We note in other areas of fundamental right such as the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="9882.710" offset="39637285">A speaker who addresses a small crowd is permitted to speak just as the speaker who addresses the large crowd and we would never be suggested that the rights can be circumscribed and the words of Terminiello versus Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="9896.709" offset="39693291">To circumscribe those rights you'd have to show it produces a clear and present danger of a serious substantive evil that rises far above public inconvenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="9905.393" offset="39727982">All that we're told is well, there's a certain inconvenience to have a small party on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="9909.766" offset="39745536">That's not our reason to deny the right of that party to compete on an equal basis with the larger political parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="9918.150" offset="39779077">What we asked most of all is for some guidelines to the state to prevent a repetition of the experience that this party has gone through where it went for decades, enjoying ballot status and now is denied that status.</text>
            <text syncTime="9931.427" offset="39832158">And we believe that the guideline should be that states can regulate the accessibility the ballot to third parties but not more than as absolutely necessary and if this can be spelled out with some greater clarity in precision and has been before, this would certainly advance the cost of participatory democracy and the rights of small groups to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="9952.516" offset="39916481">We have today many small groups in this society who feel strongly have burning feelings about issues and are capable of causing substantial disruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="9961.260" offset="39951485">Do we want to channel the discontent and the dissent in to the electoral process, I say we do.</text>
            <text syncTime="9967.080" offset="39974787">But if we're going to say to those groups, yes, if you are not satisfied with our institutions the way to express your dissent to sue the political parties but do it through either the democratic or republican party, we're not going to channel the discontent through this type because they're not going to -- they're not going to participate on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="9984.811" offset="40045735">They should be encouraged to form the wrong political groups and it should not be prohibitive and the requirement should be minimal so that it's easy for them to participate on the political process.</text>
            <text syncTime="9995.537" offset="40088576">We think this is a very important policy consideration which should inspire the Court to make the accessibility of the ballot easy and to encourage groups to participate in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="10007.984" offset="40138418">Finally, we don't think that this, what we feel to be an invidious discrimination of the small versus the large should be dignified by excluding the Socialist Labor Party from the ballot in the November 1968 Elections because it would be saying in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="10022.220" offset="40195365">This has been the main rational the District Court and in this Court's decision granting temporary injunctive relief where the point was made there had been some delay.</text>
