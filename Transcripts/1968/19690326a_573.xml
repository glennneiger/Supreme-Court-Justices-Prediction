            <text syncTime="29.968" offset="223274">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.101" offset="239783">These cases number 573 and 691 are here on writs of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.367" offset="292864">The Labor Act requires an employer to bargain with their union or with their representative which in the words of the statute has been designated or selected by a majority of the employees in an appropriate collective bargaining union.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.582" offset="373739">For more than 30 years, this Court and the Courts of Appeals both under the original Act as well as the present Act have enforced Board orders which required an employer to bargain with the Union which the employees had designated as their bargain representative by means of authorization cards and the employer did not have a “good faith” doubt of the Union's majority status.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.196" offset="484185">The court below, the court below which in the past had accepted authorization's card as adequate proof of a union's majority status for purposes of a bargaining of the bargaining obligation under Section 8 (a) (5) of the statute now holds that these authorization cards are inherently unreliable and that an employer, when he is confronted with the demand for recognition by union, whose representative status is base solely upon these authorization cards.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.435" offset="621066">That the employer may assert a good faith doubt of the Union's majority status, refused to bargain, insist upon an election and all of these irrespective of the fact that concurrently with his refusal to bargain with -- to recognize and bargain with the Union as the majority representative concurrently with that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.572" offset="709674">He is engaging in serious unfair labor practice which may either belie his reliance upon his good faith doubt or preclude a fair election.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.724" offset="758262">Hence, the central question in these cases and not only these two, these cases that were shared from the Court up here and from the Court of Appeals but also in Sinclair case which from the First Circuit which will follow these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.458" offset="813223">The central question in these cases is whether the Board may require an employer to bargain with the Union whose representative status is based solely upon authorization cards from a majority of the employees in the particular unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.159" offset="883963">And the employer's concurrent misconduct at the time that he refuses to bargain with the Union on the base of those cards is the concurrent misconduct demonstrates, demonstrates that is asserted doubt -- that he is refusing, he is refusing to bargain with the Union not because of any asserted doubt of the Union's majority status but in order to gain time, in order to dissipate the Union's strength and avoid bargaining at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="299.024" offset="1299519">And it is also in the Sinclair case as I recall it.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.309" offset="1316655">Now obviously the time that I have at my disposal, I will not be able to go into the details of these cases here but I think I can fairly say -- I can fairly say that the factual framework in which this question arises in all three cases is not essentially dissimilar.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.456" offset="1393246">And in each case, you had the Union which engage in an organizing campaign among the employees and in the course of that organizing campaign it obtain cards authorizing it, unqualifiedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.996" offset="1451342">There's no question about the cards.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.333" offset="1456671">There's no ambiguity about these cards here which are reproduced in our brief, which unqualifiedly designated the Union as their bargain representatives -- as their bargain representatives and only one of these cases from the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.387" offset="1516962">I believe that social to the Sinclair although I don't want to get into that one.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.297" offset="1536606">In only one of these cases was any question raised as to the validity of the cards in the General Steel case that claim was made that these cards were obtained by mis -- by virtue of misrepresentations as to their purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.501" offset="1589373">The Board on the basis of the entire record upon the basis of the evidence before rejected that claim and found that all these cards here, all of these cards here unqualifiedly designated the Union as the bargain representative and that there was no impropriety in the procurement of these cards.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.226" offset="1668263">Now armed with these cards, the Union went to each of the three employers in these particular cases here and asks for recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.684" offset="1698147">The employer questioning the validity of the cards, question the Union's majority status and refuse to bargain to the Union insisted upon an election.</text>

            <text syncTime="426.376" offset="1808906">We think that they are unreliable because the circumstances and I wonder which they may be may have been procured.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.468" offset="1833253">In another case an employer said, I don't think I should recognize you because four years ago, four years ago -- there was an election in which this particular union had participated and got lost.</text>

            <text syncTime="455.028" offset="1923532">And I think there's one case here where the employer really never questions the cards, never question cards and his answer was, “no comment”.</text>

            <text syncTime="1173.997" offset="4799404">The -- our analysis of course begins with Section 85 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.186" offset="4828139">Section 85 of the Act makes unfair labor practice for an employer to refuse to bargain with the representative of his employees as defined in Sections 9 (a) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.587" offset="4881742">Section 9 (a) of the Act in turn defines a representative as one which has been designated or selected by a majority of the employees in an appropriate bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.433" offset="4937122">Section 9 (a) does not specify, it does not specify how the employees will designate or select their employees and both under the original Wagner Act as well as the present Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.350" offset="4992815">The Courts of Appeals had consistently recognize, had consistently recognize that a union could establish its majority status not only by means of an election but also by other means including, including authorization cards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.506" offset="5049448">And this Court in the Arkansas Flooring case which was decided in 19 -- of some nine years, some nine years after they Taft-Hartley amendments of 1947 and I'll come to those amendments in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.985" offset="5103261">The Court in that particular case said that a union may establish its selection that an election was not the only means for a union to establish its representative status but that it could do so by other means including authorization cards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.057" offset="5167626">Now, the legislative history of -- the 1947 amendments on which the court below heavily rely for its contrary view -- for its contrary review, we submit, we suggest that it does not bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.562" offset="5225618">It does not bar reliance upon authorization cards as proof of the Union's majority status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.351" offset="5260727">I might say that the court below is the only one that the Court of Appeals and frankly, all the Courts of Appeals have had this problem that the law -- that the Court below is the only one that interprets the 94 -- 1947 amendments to bar, to bar the use cards for the purpose of establishing a union's majority status as a predicate for bargaining order under Section 85 and it's the only Court that has set that only that the Union must establish his majority status -- can only establish his majority status as a predicate for bargaining or only via the election root.</text>

            <text syncTime="1845.623" offset="7485837">The 47 amendments did not change either Section 8 (a) (5) or which was 8 (5) in the original Wagner Act or Section 9 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.007" offset="7539440">But in fact, the legislative history the 1947 amendments shows that the conference committee specifically rejected a house passed amendments which have -- where have relieve the employer, which we have a relieve the employer of any obligation to bargain with the Union, which based its majority status upon cards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.521" offset="7617494">Congress specifically rejected that proposal which would have amended Section 8 (a) (5) so as to permit the Board to issue a bargaining order only when the employer was either refusing to bargain with the Union that he was currently recognizing or a union which have been certified by the Board after an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.823" offset="7694712">Congress says that it rejected that amendment, rejected that amendment and retained the language of Section 8 (a) (5), Sections 9 (a) which from the very beginning of this statute had been interpreted both by the Board, by the courts as permitting the use of cards to establish a union as majority status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.873" offset="7778826">The 1959 amendments when there was discussion in -- when there is the legislative consideration of the 1959 amendments, Congress again took note of the fact that a Board -- that a bargaining obligation under Section 8 (5), that the issuance of a Board bargaining order was not dependent upon a board election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.705" offset="7854164">It took specific note of Board cases where the Board had required an employer to bargain with the Union which was representative status was based upon cards and where the employer had engaged in misconduct which belies his good faith doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.794" offset="7918529">Nonetheless, the 1959 Congress did not amend the basic language of Section 8 (5) or Section 9 which as I repeatedly offset is the basis for the use of cards as a means for establishing union's majority position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.056" offset="7995643">Now, its argued -- as argued very strongly that cards because of the circumstances -- because of the circumstances that may attend their procurement are inherently unreliable and that an election is the only proper way of safeguarding the employees and permitting them to vote their convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.925" offset="8087071">Alright, I would think that the fact that the Congress -- that Congress must have discounted this argument when in 1947, it rejected the House passed Amendment which was where relieved the employer of any obligation to bargain with the Union whose representative status was based upon cards.</text>

            <text syncTime="3532.580" offset="14233684">Back in the 1960's about 1961, this union started a massive organization campaign in the retail food industry there and it attempted to organize the Logan Packing Company, the Gissel Packing Company and many other companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.959" offset="14303169">Petitions were filed, cards were taken up and the Union claimed that had a majority of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.650" offset="14333994">And in 1961, the National Labor Relations Board came in, pitched its tents in this company premises, in order the employees in to vote without the President of the company hanging over their shoulder or without the Union organizer paying over their and a free expression of their wishes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3603.173" offset="14516015">Three or four years past and the Union was still under great pressure from its clients William P. Krueger and the Big Chains to organize this industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.890" offset="14562931">This was no spontaneous rising with union interest of the employees in this companies and they started in with the new technique which the Board had developed for them that is on trial before your -- this Court today, the authorization card technique.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.946" offset="14631163">And in January of 1965, they contacted Gissel, my client, and said, “We represent the majority of your employees bargain with us or we'll file unfair labor practices against you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.766" offset="14706395">We got some cards.”</text>

            <text syncTime="4785.528" offset="19245432">If I may, I will first state the three or four things which are different about the General Steel case in the context of this combined hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4805.054" offset="19323591">In General Steel, the Union lost an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="4812.410" offset="19353057">The result of the election was later set aside and the entire election proceeding dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4823.823" offset="19398614">Even though, the Board had previously found and recorded in its order that a question concerning representation existed, a finding which would squarely place the case within Section 8 (c) under which the Board concedes that it must hold an election in order to resolve the questions of representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4858.943" offset="19539153">No new election has ever been held.</text>
            <text syncTime="4866.126" offset="19567888">In this case, the Union was installed as in the other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4876.042" offset="19607489">But in this case, it was installed after having lost a secret ballot election.</text>
            <text syncTime="4888.409" offset="19657017">In this case, there were no 8 (a) (3) charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="4894.909" offset="19683035">No one was alleged or found.</text>
            <text syncTime="4898.553" offset="19697560">No individual was alleged or found to have been improperly discriminated against.</text>
            <text syncTime="4907.330" offset="19732668">The Board installed the Union based entirely upon alleged coercion by the employer and alleged failure in good faith to recognize the Union upon demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="4922.904" offset="19794944">This much more is perhaps different.</text>
            <text syncTime="4928.043" offset="19815528">In General Steel, there was a demand by the Union for recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4934.038" offset="19839561">But the Union made no offer of proof whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="4938.938" offset="19859101">I do not want to be taken as conceding that that makes a difference in this case, but I want the Court to be aware of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4947.169" offset="19892015">I think it makes this much difference or the Union fails to make any offer of proof of its position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4954.051" offset="19919600">It indicates a lack of security on the part of the Union in making its demand and is certainly something upon which the employer can rely in deciding whether he believes, the Union really represents his people.</text>

            <text syncTime="5585.342" offset="22444701">We feel that the legislative history supports the view that Congress intended to make an election the own limit for the selection of a representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="5601.370" offset="22508857">I think Congress intended probably more than I'm here contending for.</text>
            <text syncTime="5608.354" offset="22536756">The statement in the House Report on Taft-Hartley resided a long list of what Congress regarded as deprivation of employee rights, to make their own selections.</text>
            <text syncTime="5624.729" offset="22602271">Throughout the debates, there are references to the desirability of an election and no one disputed that even the senators who ultimately voted against the Taft-Hartley Amendments were so far as the record shows agreeable to the election principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="5642.818" offset="22674683">Section 8 (c) was elaborately rewritten to provide for an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="5647.805" offset="22694640">The Board's authority to do otherwise was removed from 8 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="5652.483" offset="22713344">The Board's authority to determine a representative in an unfair labor practice proceeding was stricken out of 8 (c), specifically so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5664.632" offset="22761932">They had that authority before it was taken out with the Taft-Hartley Amendment as far as I know the Board has never reconciled that with its subsequent practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5677.354" offset="22812818">Now, the Board was already, before Taft-Hartley, engaged in conducting elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="5685.431" offset="22845106">The Board had already decided that in most cases it would hold elections because it regarded elections as the reliable way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5695.603" offset="22885752">The Board had already invented its good -- its good faith test for determining whether it was going to give an employer an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="5707.525" offset="22933504">There is nothing in Taft-Hartley, nothing in the debates that I have found that shows that any intention on the part of Congress to confirm the Board's existing practice of counting authorization cards or to continue with that nor to confirm the Board's existing doctrine of good faith doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="5735.693" offset="23046144">There is a complete absence of any language to support the Board's present position.</text>
            <text syncTime="5740.294" offset="23064534">It seems to me in summary it is perfectly clear from the congressional history that the intention was to make a change.</text>
            <text syncTime="5751.892" offset="23110928">Basically though, the Board is here defending the course of action which it was already pursuing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5760.074" offset="23143633">At that time, it is contending that no change occurred start talking -- and the only piece of legislative history it hangs it on is the failure of the House Bill amending 8 (a) (5) to emerge from committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5780.299" offset="23224613">That however I think is readily explained, incidentally, this legislative history is very well summarized in a brand new pamphlet issued by the Wharton School of University of Pennsylvania by McFarland and Bishop.</text>
            <text syncTime="5796.227" offset="23288247">It just came out in February or January.</text>
            <text syncTime="5808.449" offset="23337148">The House Bill I was referring to the effort to a mandate file.</text>
            <text syncTime="5813.035" offset="23355538">The House Bill had gone too far, not only with the House Bill have amended 8 (a) (5) to require an employer to bargain only where there was an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="5829.664" offset="23421994">It -- it destroyed the existing relationships based upon voluntary recognition and the minority protested against that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5840.872" offset="23466820">The House Report said this, “If an employer is satisfied that the Union represents the majority and wishes to recognize it without it being certified on Section 9 he is free to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5858.440" offset="23537142">As long as he wishes but as long as he recognizes it or when it has been certified, he must bargain with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5865.754" offset="23566399">If he wishes not to recognize the Union or having recognized it stops doing so, stops doing so, the Union may ask for an election.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5877.519" offset="23613419">Well, that gave him a right to recognize today and withdraw tomorrow and I think Congress right agreed, there is no legislative history to show just what thoughts went into this, went into merged committees rightly agreed to not to go that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="5899.325" offset="23700668">I believe my time is getting close but let me suggest this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5908.583" offset="23737657">There are tremendous disadvantages in a reliance on cards.</text>
            <text syncTime="5914.514" offset="23761377">There is lack of anonymity for the employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="5921.974" offset="23791261">They have no chance to think it over and change their minds.</text>
            <text syncTime="5926.810" offset="23810591">There is a lack of chance to hear the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="5931.412" offset="23828982">It is totally inconsistent with the Board's Excelsior doctrine in which the Board is insisting that the employees be given a chance to hear both sides and consider this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5945.231" offset="23884257">When you do have an election and later set is aside under the Excelsior doctrine the employer has been forced to supply the Union with all these information about how to contact employees where to reach them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5958.475" offset="23937233">Even the Union, every opportunity for coercing them, if it can get to them, the Board has never adopted any system for policing these cards solicitations, never.</text>

            <text syncTime="6753.303" offset="27116544">I think that there's no question in my mind in these cases if we had filed a petition for an election that the Board would have rejected the petition based on the unfair labor practice of the Union which was found shortly after the -- a company conducted its investigations in these cases to determine whether or not the Union had a majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="6778.403" offset="27216959">You've got to remember gentlemen in this one case, in the Heck's case, in Warehouse case, the Union came to the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="6786.382" offset="27248933">They had 13 cards, there were 26 employees in the bargaining unit said, “We represent a majority.”</text>

            <text syncTime="6801.506" offset="27309432">They got another card then send a letter to the Union without relating the fact that they had secured additional card.</text>
            <text syncTime="6808.267" offset="27336391">They send a letter to the Union or the company said, “Confirming our conversation of yesterday, we -- or last week, we demand recognition and bargaining rights.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6819.528" offset="27381530">Well, nothing has come to the mind of the company which would indicate that the Union had later secured its bargaining rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="6827.924" offset="27415071">Now, one more point that I think is very a significant gentlemen and that is this matter of good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="6834.775" offset="27442448">The mere fact that a company commits unfair labor practices before, during, or after a demand for recognition in my judgment has absolutely nothing to do with his state of mind in declining to recognize a union on his down for the Union represents the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="6855.466" offset="27525204">The Union says and the Board says that, if unfair labor practices occur after the demand, he could not have had good faith when he denied it.</text>

            <text syncTime="6868.191" offset="27576090">Now, if you want to punish the company for this then this is alright.</text>
