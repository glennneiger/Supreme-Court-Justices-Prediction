            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="40.205" offset="264234">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.306" offset="280639">The question in this case which is here on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is whether the Federal Trade Commission correctly held that a sales-commission plan by which the respondent, Texaco distributed, promoted -- not distributed, I'm sorry, promoted and sponsored the sale of tires, batteries and automotive accessories made by the respondent, Goodrich Tire and Rubber Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.416" offset="409057">Promoted and sponsored the sale through the Texaco service stations in return for a commission paid to Texaco by Goodrich whether the commission properly held that this constituted an unfair method of competition in violation Section 5 of the Trade Commission Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.843" offset="494738">The respondent Texaco or respondent Goodrich also had a similar sales commission plan with the Firestone Rubber and Tire Company but I will focus primarily in this case on their relationships with Goodrich.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.458" offset="553253">This case is one of three companion cases that the commission instituted in 1956 challenging the sales-commission method of distributing tires, batteries and automotive accessories which are commonly referred to as TBA in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.686" offset="626082">And each of these cases named as a respondent a major oil company and a major tire company.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.959" offset="663176">In each case after protracted proceedings, the Trade Commission held that the sales-commission plan was an unfair method of competition and entered a broad cease and deceased order which prohibited each of these companies from engaging in this type of plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.094" offset="739767">At the end of the 1964 term, this Court upheld the Commission’s order directed against the plan involving Atlantic Refining Company and the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.665" offset="793997">Subsequent thereto, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the Commission's order directed against the plan involving the Shell Oil Company and Firestone.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.019" offset="847496">Now, while those two cases were going through the courts, in the present case, the Texaco-Goodrich case, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on a prior appeal set aside the Commission’s order.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.563" offset="905592">The Commission filed a petition for certiorari in that case and a week after this Court decided the Atlantic case in favor of the Commission it vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals and in effect remanded the case to the Commission with directions to reconsider it in the light of Atlantic.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.588" offset="985736">Upon such reconsideration, the Commission issued a new opinion and which it again in the light of Atlantic concluded that this sales-commission system was an unfair method of competition and added a cease and deceased order the same as the order that had been upheld by this Court in Atlantic.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.388" offset="1068910">Once again, the Court of Appeals set aside the Commission’s order and directed the Commission to dismiss the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.636" offset="1105899">Now, the economic relationship that exists between the respondent Texaco and its retail gasoline service station dealers is basically the same as that was presented to this Court in the Atlantic case.</text>

          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="288.277" stopTime="484.378">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="288.277" offset="1256469">Texaco is one of the largest petroleum dealers in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.197" offset="1272142">It distributes its products to 30,000 service stations many more than involve in Atlantic.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.638" offset="1293876">In fact, this represents about one-sixth of all the service stations in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.134" offset="1319894">These service stations operate on two bases as in Atlantic about 40% of them are so-called lessee dealers who lease their station from Atlantic, the remainder are so-called contract dealers who either lease their station from a third person or in fact on a station.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.653" offset="1405994">The way in which the stations are lease here is the same as basically as in Atlantic, the dealers hold the stations under short-term leases, one-year leases which permit termination by either side upon 10 days notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.094" offset="1471718">The leases have similar housekeeping clauses which permit immediate cancellation if the lessee fails to comply with these situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.327" offset="1504632">In a different -- in addition, in each instance of course the dealer is completely dependent upon Texaco for its supply of gasoline.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.949" offset="1539218">Thereto, they have a yearly contract which is terminable by the oil company on 30 days notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.600" offset="1573804">The sales commission plain in this case was originally entered into a 1940 and it was renewed in 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.378" offset="1608913">And under the plan, Goodrich agrees to pay Texaco a 10% commission on all Goodrich TBA that is sold through the Texaco gasoline stations or through wholesale outlets and this payment it stated in the sales commission agreement is in consideration of the aid to be given and the services to be rendered by your sales organization in connection with promoting the sale of Goodrich products.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.183" offset="1732106">And as I've indicated to Mr. Justice Stewart, I will shortly come to what they did in carrying out this obligation to promote the sale of products.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.296" offset="1768573">Now, during the five year period for which date is in the record 1952 to 1956, Goodrich and Firestone together sold to Texaco, $245 million worth of TBA under this plan and these two companies paid to Texaco in this period approximately $22 million in commissions for the services that Texaco performed under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.656" offset="1902007">Now, in evaluating the Commission's decision in this case and in analyzing this Court's decision in Atlantic, the parties have agreed that it maybe appropriately broken down into three elements; three elements in necessary to sustain the Commission's determination of violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.093" offset="1971702">First, did Texaco have controlling economic power over its dealers?</text>
            <text syncTime="473.064" offset="1995630">Secondly, in the performance of the sales-commission contract, did Texaco exercise that power?</text>
            <text syncTime="480.396" offset="2024991">And third, was there an adverse effect upon competition?</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="484.378" offset="2040874">We'll recess.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.628" offset="2057906">Mr. Friedman, you may continue your argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="490.952" stopTime="544.048">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="490.952" offset="2067205">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.901" offset="2082983">The Court of Appeals in this case ruled that Texaco just as Atlantic did have dominant economic power over its dealers that the record shows that in this case the dealer is no less than Atlantic were completely depending upon the oil company for their economic survival.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.905" offset="2158947">And I just like to correct something that I said in my earlier announcement as to these leases which I apparently miss spoke myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.857" offset="2190817">The precise terms of the lease are that they run from year to year but they are automatically terminable 10 days before the end of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.845" offset="2230732">And the gasoline contract similarly ran from year to year and a terminable 30 days before the end of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.293" offset="2256541">I don't want to have any suggestion that they could be terminated within the period of the yearly term.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>

          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="545.499" stopTime="546.362">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="545.499" offset="2285380">By either party.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="546.362" offset="2288828">And as I -- then the facts good many of these service station operators are lessees of Texaco.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="555.866" stopTime="556.334">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="555.866" offset="2326862">That is right.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="556.334" stopTime="563.695">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="556.334" offset="2328743">But a great many are or at least to some are also lessees of other people and some own their property.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="563.695" stopTime="710.585">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="563.695" offset="2358105">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.288" offset="2360508">Roughly 60% are either owners of the property or lessees from third persons and roughly 40% about 13,000 up to 30,000 all lessees from Texaco.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.062" offset="2415574">But the -- in their fundamental characteristics, these agreements are the same, they are short term, they have the housekeeping provisions and of course as this Court has noted on several occasions these gasoline station people are small businessmen in every sense of the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.206" offset="2492165">They have what for then as a very substantial investment in their service station and the service station itself is a relatively expensive proposition and as this Court correctly pointed out we think in Atlantic as result of all these disparities these two people do not just bargain as equals.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.978" offset="2567293">There's a tremendous disparity in bargaining power and in these circumstances understandably the service station dealers are reluctant to do anything that might antagonize their relationship with the oil company dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.681" offset="2626121">Now, since the Court of Appeals has found in this case and upheld the Commission's determination that the oil company has this economic power of its dealers, the two remaining issues in this case is whether the Trade Commission was wanted in concluding in the light of the Atlantic decision that what they did, what Texaco did in this case in performing the sales commission agreement constituted an exercise of that power and also that in the result of such exercise was to cause a serious impediment to competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.232" offset="2772302">And in approaching that problem, I think it's appropriate once again to stress the limited nature of judicial review of the Commission's determination that a particular practice is an unfair method of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.161" offset="2836041">This Court in Atlantic pointed out that where the Congress has provided that an administrative agency initially apply a broad statutory term to a particular situation our function is limited to determining whether the Commission's decision has warned in the record and a reasonable basis in Loew, it went on to say that while the final word is left to the Court necessarily we give great discretion to the Commission's determinations.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="729.372" offset="3020884">It's difficult to say how -- there's no question that they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.267" offset="3032482">In fact, the examiner found that all of them handled some TBA that was so-called nonsponsored.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.558" offset="3061635">But the evidence indicates that much of this handling of the so-called nonsponsored product was in fact the so-called occasional pickup business that customer came in and wanted a couple of tires or needed some sparkplug or something that need to fill, fill it in.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.145" offset="3127986">There's no qualitative a data in this record as to precisely to what percentage of the dealers or what percentage of total TBA was sponsored.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.914" offset="3171035">But we do have the fact that over five-year period as I indicated they sold a total of $245 million worth of TBA through the Texaco outlets.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.659" offset="3222026">Now, I'd like at the very outset to point out and acknowledge that this case in a number of respect to significantly different than Atlantic insofar as the exercise of the power is concerned and insofar as what the effects upon competition were.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.201" offset="3292139">In the first case, we make no claim in this case now that there was any coercion by Texaco of its dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.141" offset="3319933">That is dealers were not threatened that they would have their leases cancelled if they should handle competing products.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.728" offset="3346265">Secondly, we don't have here what we had in Atlantic the policing by the oil company of its dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.885" offset="3370924">They did not for example receive information from the tire company as to dealers to whom the tire company couldn't sell and take steps to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.419" offset="3409063">They didn't have the so-called phantom inspectors going around and checking in that sense on the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.596" offset="3433723">There's nothing here to show that Texaco would pull down signs advertising competing products.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.947" offset="3467160">And in addition to that unlike Atlantic, we don't have here a dramatic shift in business following the initiation of the sales-commission plan in Atlantic.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.381" offset="3504880">This Court will recall it as tremendous shift in business over a period of a year when the sales-commission plan was initiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.434" offset="3529122">We don't have that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.250" offset="3536332">Now, on the impact on competition, in Atlantic, there were an impact that three levels in this case, there's only an impact at one.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.952" offset="3575202">In Atlantic, what happened was Atlantic divided its operating territories between Goodyear on the one hand and Firestone on the other hand and thus eliminated all inter-brand competition between the two tire companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.360" offset="3632776">We did not have that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.489" offset="3641344">Secondly, in Atlantic, the arrangement was that each dealer was assigned to a special supply point, he had a purchase from one source of Goodyear or Firestone and that had the effect of course of eliminating all intrabrand competition between dealers in the particular rubber companies such as Goodyear in competing for the custom of a single dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.814" offset="3738624">But what we do have here and what the Commission pitches its case on is the impact on competition upon the competing suppliers of TBA.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.416" offset="3788988">That is the people who were competing with Goodrich and Firestone to sell to the Texaco stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.428" offset="3821066">The Commission pointed ruled that the differences, the factual differences between this case in Atlantic were immaterial because it said that the Texaco sales-commission on agreement and the words that used were, in its fundamental operation and effect is indistinguishable from the one held unlawful in Atlantic.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.445" offset="3909151">The Commission interpreted this Court's Atlantic decision in effect is holding his files.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.866" offset="3934856">It said that this Court rule that while coercive practices aggravate the restraint imposed by the sales-commission plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.328" offset="3968711">It is the oil company's power over its dealers, derived from the contractual relationship between them and the utilization of that power through the performance of the promotional services required by the sales-commission agreement which renders the sales-commission plan unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.129" offset="4039868">In other words, the Commission held here is what this Court we think recognized in the Atlantic but the basic vice of the sales-commission plan was the utilization of economic power in one market the gasoline market to restrain competition in another market, the TBA market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.786" offset="4114474">And we think that the Commission properly drew that conclusion here because Texaco no less than Atlantic we think, brought its economic power over its dealers to bear in a way that gave the Goodrich Company and Firestone Company a competitive advantage over other sellers of TBA and selling to the importance segment of the TBA market that was represented by the numerous Texaco service stations which were located basically throughout most of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.534" offset="4249475">Now, the Commission summarized at considerable length how Texaco had used its economic power in the performance of the sales-commission contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.686" offset="4294092">It listed; I'll refer to six instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.666" offset="4306004">The first thing is that even before the dealer was signed up for as a dealer, the Texaco people stressed to him the importance of carrying adequate stock of TBA and also urged upon him to select either Goodrich or Firestone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.295" offset="4380505">And if he does select one of these two sponsored brands, Texaco takes the initiative and introduces him to the representative of the rubber company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.723" offset="4418226">Before the station is actually opened, Texaco frequently informs either or both of Goodrich and Firestone of the opening of such station although the record does also indicate that in many instances, the rubber companies were aware of this themselves and made the first sales pitch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.554" offset="4489592">Texaco actively promote, participates in the promotion campaigns of Firestone and Goodrich.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.560" offset="4521566">At their various dealer meetings, they have training courses at those courses of the sponsored products are frequently used for the training and display purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.790" offset="4562526">And in addition to that, representatives of the rubber companies frequently attend this meeting.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="1124.800" offset="4602546">Well, it's advertising -- it varies again, they frequently do advertise the sponsored products and let me say Mr. Chief Justice, we don't claim that this is the only thing in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.805" offset="4650611">There's evidence in the record of course that they do advertise nonsponsored products but we think as I shall develop that this is really immaterial at the critical thing is that they did play a very active role in promoting the sale of the sponsored products to their dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.069" offset="4719679">And finally, the Commission said, perhaps most effective of all that Texaco salesman continually carries the message in his day to day contacts with the dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.940" offset="4767117">In this regard is important to remember that these Texaco salesmen who were most directly involved in pushing the sponsored TBA products also play a critical role in the annual dealer evaluations and in determination of whether the dealer's list and contractual relations with Texaco are to be renewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.361" offset="4844857">And the Commission concluded that the consequence of these promotional efforts by Texaco was to impress upon Texaco dealers through constant repetition and in a variety of ways that Texaco whose favor the dealer must court has a strong interest in their purchase of the sponsored products.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.651" offset="4930017">Now, the record in this case indicates that although Texaco did inform its dealers that they are independent businessmen who had the freedom to select what other brand of TBA they wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.226" offset="4984247">In fact, its performance to this contract, its recommendation, its promotion, its sponsorship of the Goodrich and Firestone products did put competing distributors of TBA at a very definite disadvantage in selling to Texaco outlets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.327" offset="5052688">The Commission called 31 witnesses who are representatives of competing wholesale sellers of TBA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.697" offset="5086124">These witnesses testified basically as to the difficulties they had in selling to Texaco outlets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.212" offset="5116217">They testified that in some instances there were outlets to whom they couldn't sell at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.784" offset="5134503">They testified as to other Texaco outlets, they would sell them on occasional item that they couldn't get them to stock the products.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.532" offset="5161462">They testified as to numerous instances where they receive and stop calling upon the Texaco outlets because they just found it was a waste of time, they couldn't sell to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.390" offset="5200959">And then they testified into some instances not too many admittedly but a substantial number in which the Firestone -- I'm sorry which the Texaco dealers explain that they would unwilling to purchase the competing products because of the fact they were told they had to carry a sponsored brand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.625" offset="5277863">And I think the Commission fairly summarized this evidence when it said page 91 of volume 6 of this little document that we have here which contains most of the things is that -- that as a result, many Texaco dealers as result of Texaco vigorous sales campaign to its dealers, many Texaco dealers were left with the impression that Texaco would look with disfavor upon their purchase of nonsponsored TBA products and that they were acquired to purchase the sponsored TBA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.804" offset="5422582">Now, the practical effectiveness program I think is well brought out in the testimony of a man named Richard Tidwell which is set forth in volume 2 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.660" offset="5477961">Mr. Tidwell was an airline pilot who went into the service station business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.667" offset="5498023">He was a lease dealer for two years and then left because he wanted to go back into flying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.994" offset="5519339">And he testified that when he was interviewed they explained to him the advantages of TBA recommended Goodrich or Firestone and he selected Firestone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.187" offset="5572106">At a later point, he considered the possibility of taking on a cheaper brand of tires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.589" offset="5605752">And at page 1211 of the record at the top of the page he explained what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.724" offset="5630307">He said, “I was thinking seriously about putting in a line of the second cheaper brand of tires.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.108" offset="5655803">And I explain this to Mr. Fitz for authentically he was a Texaco representative there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.419" offset="5677014">He told me at that time and I will say this much in his words as possibly said, “Dick, we cannot tell you not to handle these tires but we attempt to be more lenient or look with favor on our dealers who are more loyal to us.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.028" offset="5731453">As a consequence, I told them that I would not handle the tires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.220" offset="5748276">And then down at the bottom of the page, Mr. Tidwell was asked, “Mr. Tidwell, why didn't you ever carry any other brand of TBA in your station other than Firestone?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.863" offset="5786833">The top of page 1212 he said, “When I found out that the Texas company desired me to carry only one line, I endeavored to work with them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.391" offset="5824972">And the same thought was repeated at the top the latter part of page 1217 when Mr. Tidwell was asked, “Why he had asked from Mr. Fitz' advice about handling these competing tires?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.021" offset="5871470">He said, “I asked for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.881" offset="5878888">One, I had confidence in this judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.526" offset="5889442">The other is if he had any objections because I wanted to stay on good standing with the Texaco Company.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1455.190" offset="5924133">Mr. Tidwell -- the employee was a Mr. Fitz who had the position of being manager of the Goodyear Bulk Refinery I'm sorry, Goodrich Bulk Refinery in the, I' sorry Texaco Bulk Refinery in the area where he was working.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.994" offset="5979303">He was a Texaco official with whom he had dealt in negotiating his lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.759" offset="6002395">Now, indeed, it's rather difficult to understand why these two large companies would pay $22 million to the Texaco Company if they didn't think that in return for this day the were getting some advantage that they could not have gotten for their own sales efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.438" offset="6085151">This Court in Atlantic pointed this out when it's stated that it is difficult to escape the conclusion that there would have been little point in paying substantial commissions to oil companies were it not for their ability to exert power over their wholesalers and dealers and ability adequately demonstrated on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.863" offset="6166862">The Court of Appeals however rejected the Commission's finding that Texaco had exercised its economic power basically on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.727" offset="6210330">First, the Court said page 112 of this little sixth volume of the appendix, the Court of Appeals said, “A finding of coercion is the threshold requirement of a determination of exercise of dominant economic power.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.433" offset="6285145">It read this Court's in Atlantic decision as so holding and since it's set aside the Commission's finding that there have been done -- that there have been coercion it concluded as the first ground that the finding of exercise economic power could not stand.</text>

            <text syncTime="1955.587" offset="7925739">The -- now, there's another aspect of the Commission's decision of the Court of Appeals decision which is the Court of Appeals seem to think and we of course disagree that this Court in its Atlantic decision defined the precise limits of the Commission's power to condemn a sales-commission plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.369" offset="8036812">And then they review all of the acts that Texaco had done, line them up against the acts at Atlantic had done say this was significantly different and therefore concluded that the Commission could not treat this an exercise of the economic power of Texaco.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.471" offset="8105253">Again, we think that's not what Atlantic held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.273" offset="8116433">Atlantic merely decided on the facts before it that the Commission was justified and we think the Court of Appeals here has approached the review of the Commission's order in the wrong way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.646" offset="8157915">It seems to us what the Court of Appeals should've done has not looked and saying, is this case on all force with Atlantic?</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.836" offset="8182680">It should've said is despite the differences between this case and Atlantic was the Commission justified in concluding that nevertheless this practice -- this sales-commission system did constitute a sufficient exercise of power and did have a significantly sufficient impact on competition to warrant condemning it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.517" offset="8273481">And this brings me to the third element of the equation if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.433" offset="8297096">The effect of this plan on competition, now, in the Atlantic case, this Court recognized that the basic impact of the sales-commission plan upon competition was comparable to a tie-in arrangement that is in each case the person who was doing the purchasing felt constrain to exercise, to make his choice not on a completely free basis but upon some feeling that he had to do, he had to satisfy the oil company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.233" offset="8420289">And it therefore concluded that in determining the impact on competition, it was appropriate to apply in this area the standards that had been developed in the tie-in cases, that is it was enough to show that a not insubstantial amount of commerce was affected and it was unnecessary for the Commission to make a lengthy and protracted analysis of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.729" offset="8518301">In the Atlantic case, the total amount of sponsored TBA that was sold over a five-year period under the sales-commission agreements between Atlantic and Goodyear and Firestone was slightly over $50 million over five-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.021" offset="8587473">In this case, in one year, the last year 1956 the total sales were approximately $58 million and over the five-year period the total sales involved in this case were almost five times at Atlantic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.011" offset="8647450">That is $245 million as against $50 million in Atlantic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.022" offset="8671483">And of course when a not in substantial volume of commerce is tied up this way, the effect on competition is enough even though not all the dealers were tied up, even though many of the dealers handle competing products and even though many of them didn't handle sponsored product at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.419" offset="8745044">The critical thing we think from this record is that the effect of the Texaco sales-commission plan has been effectively defense off from a substantial segment of the TBA market represented by Texaco dealers competing sellers of TBA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.009" offset="8823411">Now, there are two other factors involved in considering the impact on competition that I think it's appropriate to mention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.882" offset="8854862">When the Commission decided this case on remand, it already had decided the two other TBA cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.543" offset="8885582">And in the course of studying these three cases it had learned a great deal about the TBA industry and one of the things that had been disclosed in the course of these three cases whether it's only the very large tire companies that are able to have these sales-commission plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.596" offset="8961755">It also it's clear that the service stations by their nature of becoming increasingly important outlets for the distribution of TBA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.526" offset="9001462">And thus, it becomes more and more important to the competing manufactures of TBA, the smaller manufacturers who were not able to enjoy these sales-commission plans that we eliminate the restraints on access to the market that these plans represent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.046" offset="9079515">In the Atlantic case, this Court referred to the destructive effect on commerce that would result from the widespread use of these contracts by major oil companies in supplies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.750" offset="9122356">And this is not wholly theoretical because we do have in this case the evidence that a small battery manufacture in Texas had great difficulty in selling to the Texaco outlets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.927" offset="9183065">In addition, there's a further anomaly in this situation if this sales-commission plan is permitted to go forward what would amounts to is that even though Texaco is two or three times larger than Atlantic, Texaco is permitted to engage in the basic kind of arrangement that is prohibited to Atlantic and some of the other companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.279" offset="9280449">And finally, I think it's important to stress the basic prophylactic role that Congress intended Section 5 of the Trade Commission Act promote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.977" offset="9331231">I refer to Justice Brandeis' notable dissent in the Gratz case which this Court only two or three years ago recognized is now the proper approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.332" offset="9376684">That is under Section 5, it's not necessary to await until the point that a restraint of trade turns into a full blown violation of the Sherman Act or the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.295" offset="9424541">The Commission can step in and even at a preliminary stage because of the dangerous tendencies which it practice has and we think that this practice -- this practice, there's a demonstrated anticompetitive effect but in any event, the possible potential dangers of these plans continue as this Court recognized in Atlantic for both (Inaudible) for both the competing smaller manufacturers of TBA and the wholesale distributors of those commodities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2368.157" offset="9576051">When the 1965 following the Court's decision in Atlantic, Your Honors remanded this case to the Commission for reconsideration in the light of the principles laid down in Atlantic, it was perfectly plain that as it is now that Texaco was a large company engaged in the sale of petroleum products to its dealers that Goodrich is a large tire company and the business of selling TBA items that Texaco's leases and sales agreements with its dealers are of short duration and that Texaco's dealers purchase substantial quantities of the sponsored Goodrich TBA.</text>

            <text syncTime="2500.162" offset="10104038">He's one of the most distinguished graduates of our school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.299" offset="10128593">On oral argument, he emphatically declared and I quote “the Government does not suggest that there may not be commission sales agreements which would satisfy Section 5.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.066" offset="10191600">He squarely recognized and again I quote, “That there may very well be situations where eliminating some of the things they namely, Atlantic and Goodyear did in this case would not have the same adverse effect on the competition as the plan, the Commission condemn.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.433" offset="10281148">He repeatedly in response to the questions from the Court disclaimed a per se theory of the legality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.777" offset="10314480">And no claim of per se unlawfulness was made in the Government's brief in Atlantic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.533" offset="10341543">More importantly, Mr. Justice Clark's opinion does not hold that the mere existence of superior economic power in the oil company be with its dealers results in illegality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.134" offset="10407894">The opinion makes clear that the gravamen of the violation consist of the misused of that power with concomitant anticompetitive results.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.573" offset="10461706">In a nutshell, the Commission's order in Atlantic was upheld because the oil company, and I'm quoting now from Mr. Justice Clark, “Marshaled its full economic power in a continuing campaign to force its dealers and wholesalers to buy Goodyear products.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.821" offset="10566614">And that rational was precisely the one that the Government advanced in its brief to this Court and again, I quote, “In some, Atlantic marshaled the full measure of its economic power over its dealers to carryout a pressure campaign designed to get them to handle Goodyear and Firestone products and because of the extent of that power, the campaign was highly successful.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2704.058" offset="10919581">Your Honors remanded the case for the application of Atlantic to the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.102" offset="10943822">That's what your mandate said and Mr. Friedman has acknowledged in response to a question that Atlantic does not control and the Court of Appeals held that Atlantic was not controlling because the facts were different and that's why it's one of the reasons why it set aside the order of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.008" offset="11059388">Now, why is this case Your Honors different from the other two?</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.266" offset="11080391">This case is different because Texaco unlike Atlantic and Shell did not wilt its economic power to interfere with the freedom of choice of its dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.544" offset="11137546">Twice has the Court of Appeals so found after careful review of this bulky sixth volume record applying the same principles as those established in Atlantic and enforced in Shell by the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.889" offset="11214973">The Court below found that the Texaco dealers were entirely free to handle the TBA of their own choice without any interference whatsoever on the part of Texaco.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.627" offset="11277876">It found that it is been Texaco's policy to respect the independence of its dealers and that its practices have matched that policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.208" offset="11324165">This was the testimony of literality scores of witnesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="2821.862" offset="11390830">It's our submission Your Honors that a plan which leaves dealers entirely free to accept or to reject sponsored products cannot produce any anticompetitive effect and unless the Court adopts a doctrine of per se illegality cannot be found to be unlawful and that was why I started my argument by trying to point out that the Court had not in the prior case to reach any conclusions as to per se illegality.</text>

            <text syncTime="2878.751" offset="11618408">The Commission asked Texaco to compile certain information which it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.068" offset="11655607">The Commission offered this evidence itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.946" offset="11671176">This evidence showed that less than one-third of Texaco dealers handled any of the sponsored tires and only about one-fifth handled the sponsored batteries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.039" offset="11763545">This means that 80% of the batteries that they handled were nonsponsored and about 70% of the tires were nonsponsored and they handled a great variety of other products.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.004" offset="11819342">This record as we pleat with the advertisements of 250 different TBA items which the Texaco dealers handled and advertised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.104" offset="11875767">Now, the curious thing that we find about the Government's argument here is that it neither contends for a rule of per se illegality nor does it make a frontal attack on the findings of the Court of Appeals upholding the freedom of Texaco dealers to handle TBA of their own choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.106" offset="11979839">Instead, in its brief, the Solicitor General appears to be propounding a brand new theory of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.442" offset="12021112">I might say this case has been before this Court twice, before the Court of Appeals twice, before the Commission three times and each time that I've appeared, I've been confronted with a new theory of the legality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.312" offset="12088613">Before I address myself to the new theory, I'd like to with Your Honors permission underscore what is not involved in this case as Mr. Friedman pointed out, we're not confronted here with coercion that's out of the case nor does the case involved any claim of a tie-in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.703" offset="12186206">That argument was made before the Court of Appeals on the first ground and it was rejected because it's unsupported by the facts and it has never been devoured.</text>

            <text syncTime="3294.550" offset="13281573">Mr. Tidwell as my good friend points out had the conversation with the dealer, with the salesmen which he asked for the salesmen advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.398" offset="13336952">Now, the record shows that Tidwell continued to sell these nonsponsored tires as well as nonsponsored batteries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.027" offset="13375509">And he told the examiner that he was handling Firestone because he preferred to handle Firestone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.499" offset="13401318">So we had dangling in the air a conversation which apparently has no effect because he continues to handle the other products just after the conversation exactly as he did before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.256" offset="13456384">Now, what is left to this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.124" offset="13479894">The Government in its brief says that even if the dealers were not constrained they felt that they were constrained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.790" offset="13518555">This, I think Your Honor is the velvet glove.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.315" offset="13540603">The argument is made that the Texaco dealer though not in fact required to buy a sponsored product.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.362" offset="13568815">Nevertheless, does not exercise the freedom that is his of selecting TBA brands solely on the basis of the comparative merits of the competing products.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.757" offset="13618448">The suggestion is that the dealer may be concerned albeit erroneously that Texaco would disapprove of his purchase of nonsponsored TBA so that in the absence of strong countervailing, the fact is the dealer is most likely to acquiesce in Texaco's recommendation to purchase the sponsored products.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.700" offset="13714160">Now, I believe we have the right to ask where in this record is the proof that the Texaco dealers do not purchase TBA on the basis of irrelative merits of the particular brand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.985" offset="13771316">Where is the proof that there must be strong countervailing factors before Texaco dealers provide nonsponsored products?</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.052" offset="13811545">Where is the proof that Texaco dealers fail constrain to acquiesce in Texaco's recommendations?</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.875" offset="13846862">I should've thought, Your Honors, that since the Government's argument depends on psychoanalyzing a body of dealers, it would've favored us with some words from the patients themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.423" offset="13901093">But the most amazing part of this new theory is that it is evoked in the case where the Government failed to call a single Texaco dealer and Texaco has 38,000 of them to testify as a witness not one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.917" offset="13970996">Now, why should the Government on appeal after 13 years of litigation now speculate or make assumptions concerning the attitude or feelings of the dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.050" offset="14015613">The dealers were at all times available as witnesses, they could've testified as to what animated their TBA purchases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.751" offset="14050408">Texaco in fact produced many of these, such witnesses as part of its defense case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.111" offset="14075800">And they made it perfectly plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.339" offset="14084681">Some 54 of them but they were not pressured and to anything by Texaco and that they felt no constrain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.076" offset="14115715">The Government on the other hand avoided dealer witnesses like to play.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.109" offset="14139852">And we don't have to look too hard for the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.116" offset="14155839">I refer Your Honors to volume 5 of the appendix and you will see there a form letter which counsel to the Commission sent to Texaco dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.183" offset="14212054">The first paragraph of which reads, complaints including one on the above entitled matter currently pending before the Commission are intended to determine whether operators of major oil company petroleum outlets are independent businessmen with complete freedom of choice as to the products which they stopped for resale or are obliged to handle products chosen for them by the respective oil companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.918" offset="14347055">And then in connection with this issue, the questionnaire seeks information as to whether TBA has handled and what is the principle line that is handled when they took on the line and similar matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.923" offset="14415078">In short, in this questionnaire, the Government -- the Commission correctly stated the issue which was the issue which was tried whether the dealers have freedom of choice or whether they were obliged to buy the sponsored products.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.675" offset="14490102">Now, after getting the facts, elicited by this question there what the Commission do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.100" offset="14519777">They decided not to call any Texaco dealers as witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.042" offset="14539525">The plain implication is that the responses to the question there did not support the charges against respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.078" offset="14571708">Indeed, the one response which Texaco was able to obtain and which is set out as JAX 428 of the record at last page very clearly why the dealers were not put on the stand because the witness indicated that he was totally free.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.491" offset="14649344">Now, having in its possession facts which negates its theory and supported the defense, the Commission not only did not introduce these facts, it suppressed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.604" offset="14705768">It refused even to disclose to Texaco the names of the persons that had interviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.147" offset="14731995">Now, after withholding evidence that the Texaco dealers do not feel constrain to buy the sponsored TBA I submit that the Government is highly in the position to ask this Court now to make the assumptions upon which its present argument rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.359" offset="14812766">Now, Mr. Justice Douglas in Brady against Maryland quotes from former Solicitor General Sobeloff, an addressed that he made and which he said, “My client's chief business is not to achieve victory but to establish justice.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.344" offset="14900746">And I must regretfully state to this Court the model of the Commission is precisely the reversed as this sorted and supported record demonstrates and has -- as does the history of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.365" offset="14968874">Now, certainly the hearsay testimony of a few wholesalers does not remedy the deficiency of the Government's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.018" offset="15011401">These wholesalers testified they were told by some particular Texaco dealer who decline to buy nonsponsored TBA from them but he couldn't do so because Texaco might disapprove.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.588" offset="15069706">Quite apart from the inherently unreliable nature of this hearsay, the wholesalers themselves on this record acknowledged their potential customers may convene excuses for not buying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.113" offset="15127803">The testimony was overwhelmingly rebutted as the Court below found but the record as a whole.</text>

            <text syncTime="4373.432" offset="17597106">The salesman for a wholesaler testified that he was unable to sell none sponsored tires to a particular Texaco station and that the gist of the conversation was that he wouldn't dare to buy or display such tires.</text>
            <text syncTime="4389.087" offset="17659695">The dealer himself was called to the stand and gave the light of these testimonies stating that he knew that he was free to buy nonsponsored TBA that most of the TBA that he buys is in fact nonsponsored.</text>
            <text syncTime="4402.674" offset="17714030">He went on to testify that he sort out the very wholesaler in question to deal with them and that he has continued to purchase nonsponsored TBA from there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4413.676" offset="17758124">The Government also in its brief refers to the testimony of a wholesaler who reported that he lost a particular Texaco dealer as a customer and that the dealer told him he was going to have to handle Goodrich products.</text>
            <text syncTime="4427.164" offset="17812041">This ignores the reason for the ship which occurred incidentally some 14 years that the Texaco sales-commission plan went into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4436.566" offset="17849657">The reason as the wholesaler admitted on cross-examination was that the dealer's brother had just become a Goodrich distributor at a location one and a half blocks from the dealer station.</text>
            <text syncTime="4450.252" offset="17904410">In short, this Texaco dealer bought nonsponsored TBA continuously until his brother went into business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4459.573" offset="17941713">The Court of Appeals we submit had the right on the Universal Camera to take the record as a whole and to find that this evidence was not worthy of belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4470.602" offset="17985808">It could've relied upon the fact that the witnesses who are representatives of one small battery manufacturer and 19 wholesalers out of the thousands have supplies in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4481.911" offset="18031052">And Chicago alone where many of them came there were some 500 TBA distributors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4488.337" offset="18056756">The bulk of these competing suppliers operated the competitive disadvantage wholly unrelated to Texaco sales-commission agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4497.387" offset="18092910">Several conceded that they were unable to match the price brand or credit offered by competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4504.990" offset="18123316">Most of them did not carry a full line of TBA which is necessary for effective competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4510.854" offset="18146826">Even so, virtually all of these witnesses had Texaco dealers among their customers and in each territory to which their testimony related there was overwhelming proof that the nonsponsored products handled by Texaco dealers were advertised and openly displayed at their stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4529.980" offset="18223313">In this context of open display and advertising of nonsponsored products by Texaco dealers was no basis for any dealer feeling constraint.</text>

            <text syncTime="5811.714" offset="23350209">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5815.150" offset="23364002">Of course it seems -- I'd like to answer with something Mr. Barton said, the basic question here isn't whether there's been misuse of economic power.</text>
            <text syncTime="5824.142" offset="23399946">This -- no one has being punished here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5825.856" offset="23406843">The Commission is performing the prophylactic function of freeing our economy from an improper restraints and the question is whether the use of this power whether the use of this power together with what a fencing law from part of the competitive area whether that's enough to justify the Commission in concluding that it's an unfair method of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5850.407" offset="23504959">Now, there's been a lot of talk about some of the evidence in this case and I just like to go back to a couple of these items that my opponents have referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5860.300" offset="23544560">For example, this man Mr. Tidwell whom they say felt perfectly free to carry these products nonetheless.</text>
            <text syncTime="5868.611" offset="23577788">At page 1211, after the passage I previously referred to, he was asked, “Did you take on a cheaper line of tires?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5878.599" offset="23617808">And his answer was, “Not in stock but I did sell some.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5883.981" offset="23639333">And then three or four lines thereafter, he was asked, “Did you ever display those tires in your station?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5890.062" offset="23663574">He says, “No, I never displayed any other product than Firestone.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5894.651" offset="23681964">What it seem to us is very clear from this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5897.082" offset="23691682">What he was saying was because he wanted to remain in the good graces of Texaco.</text>
            <text syncTime="5902.431" offset="23713102">He would not take these products, these competing products on as a display product that will be generally available for the public to see.</text>
            <text syncTime="5909.979" offset="23743300">Sure, he would occasionally buy some of these products and that's fully consistent with the testimony of these wholesalers that yes, they could sell, they could sell on occasional item to Texaco dealer, to many Texaco dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5923.246" offset="23796381">They could sell a few things that the people wanted to stock up on but basically there were substantial testimony in this record that these people did not have the same opportunities when they tried to penetrate the Texaco market as when they tried to penetrate some other markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="5940.805" offset="23866598">Now, what are these dealers do?</text>

            <text syncTime="5944.177" offset="23880077">Well, Mr. Friedman, I gather then that you feel that although the question maybe that the -- whether the Commission could say power plus promotion is nevertheless there's a really the question is whether the Commission could rationally decide that promotion by one with power really may have some substantial consequences?</text>

            <text syncTime="6456.059" offset="25927659">And I think the record fully supports the Commission and it seems to us that the Court of Appeals the appropriate for Court of Appeals should've put the inquiry whether the Commission was justified in the light of these facts shown by the record in concluding that this particular practice had a sufficiently pernicious effect actual and potential on competition to warrant condemning it not to try to line this thing up and saying they have done everything here that they did in Atlantic and the Court of Appeals said, "No, they haven't and that's the end of this.</text>
