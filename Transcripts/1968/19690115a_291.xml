            <text syncTime="29.420" offset="221080">One Gordon McNeill, stevedore employee of the petitioner, Federal Marine Terminals Inc. fell into the number 3 deep tank of the vessel Otterburn owned by the respondent on June 2, 1965 and was killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.604" offset="329749">Thereafter, his widow filed a wrongful death action against the vessel owners.</text>

            <text syncTime="98.754" offset="498395">In a counterclaim of this petitioner, petitioner sought to bring a direct action against the vessel, the petitioner being a stevedoring contractor and thought to recover all the damages that it was exposed to under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act which had a potential total liability of $70,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.524" offset="657429">That counterclaim was dismissed upon the motion of the respondent in the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="391.789" offset="1670562">But that is not the instant case before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.147" offset="1711940">We suggest and urge to this Court that the Ryan Stevedoring Company case in 1956 established that there was a stevedoring contract even though unwritten which was implied in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.533" offset="1817475">Under the stevedoring contract, certain duties were owed by the stevedoring contractor directly to the vessel owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.711" offset="1878183">If a violation of those duties by the stevedoring contractor and the very essence of that duty having been defined in that case as being the proper performance of the stevedoring contract either offloading or unloading the cargo, if there be a violation of those duties, the vessel owner could recover complete indemnification from the stevedoring contractor for any amount that the vessel owner became obligated to pay to the -- to an employee of the stevedoring contractor who was injured aboard the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.784" offset="2094477">That case focused on side of that relationship.The duties owed by stevedoring contractor to the vessel owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.491" offset="2145364">It also stated that the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act did not preclude the vessel owner from being sued by the employee of the stevedoring contractor under a tort theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.868" offset="2238882">And the stevedoring of the vessel owner turning around if there was a judgment against him by the stevedore and recovering the full amount of that judgment directly from the stevedoring contractor based on a breach of contract theory, the -- this Court announced in that decision that the tort theory was not to be confused with the contract theory that the action by the vessel owner against the stevedoring contractor was directly based on contract and not any tort theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.737" offset="2474297">We read in the Weyerhaeuser Steamship Company case in 1958, the warning announced by this Court that the vessel owner can be precluded from recovering directly from the stevedore contractor if there might be conduct on its part to preclude such recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.728" offset="2618284">This Court did not go further to define what that might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.182" offset="2644093">In 1959, in Hugev versus Dampskisaktieselskabet International, the District Court which was affirmed by the Ninth Circuit and certiorari was denied by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.318" offset="2756629">The District Court announced what the duties of the vessel owner were under the stevedoring contract even though it be unwritten stating that these were implied in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.757" offset="2846386">In essence these duties were to provide a reasonable, reasonably safe place to work and to give warning of any latent danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.414" offset="2925066">These duties we have quoted in length in our brief and I briefly summarize them but in essence those are the duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.074" offset="2975640">In the Hugev case, because the stevedoring contractor knew of a violation of these duties by the vessel owner and thereafter assumed the risk, recovery was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.124" offset="3051917">But these duties were thoroughly announced in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.010" offset="3079398">We -- in the Hugev case, there was a statement that the stevedoring contractor does not board the vessel at its own peril.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.649" offset="3138017">The owner does not turn over to the stevedoring contractor a vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.169" offset="3180022">In any condition, we submit to this Court that there must be a reasonable time where the stevedoring contractor to inspect that vessel and to discover and correct any false in that vessel that might exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.217" offset="3280227">If this ship owner can turnover to the stevedoring contractor a vessel in any condition, be there exports or otherwise which are misplaced for a week, then we suggest this would encourage willful and wanton misconduct because under the Ryan doctrine, the stevedoring contractor has almost an absolute liability for indemnification to the vessel owner.</text>

            <text syncTime="2080.384" offset="8424887">Because this is a duty generally owed to everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.728" offset="8446307">This duty to exercise ordinary care which is spoken of by the petitioner and the duty to warn of a hidden defect, these are tort obligations and this Court in Ryan admonished that in ascertaining a shipowner's liabilities and his responsibilities that resort may not be had to principals of quasi contract or to principles of tort liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.808" offset="8570650">Mr. Justice White, you addressed yourself to the question what duties are owed to and when it comes aboard a ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.015" offset="8595414">And I think it was -- but that question was put to rest in the Kermarec that the shipowner owes the duties to use ordinary care and to warn of hidden defects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.918" offset="8651003">He owes these to all persons who are lawfully aboard his vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.027" offset="8667512">Therefore, it is clear I believe, it's obvious that is are not duties arising by virtue of contract but that they are independently owed duties and they're tort duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.182" offset="8740133">Now the shipowner of the -- pardon me, the stevedore has brought his counterclaim alleging that he has a independent cause of action against this -- against the shipowner under contract and separate from the action which is given him under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.180" offset="8828113">He says that Section 33 of that Act provides a statutory method by which an employer may be reimbursed for the compensation expenditures that must pay for -- to its injured employees but he says because the Act is not specifically barring independent cause of action therefore it should not preclude this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.083" offset="8935737">We feel that that argument is false or at least the fallacy can be demonstrated by the fact that prior to the enactment of compensation statutes generally in this statute in particular, an employer no -- had no non-negligent liability for injuries to its employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.682" offset="9014105">Therefore we feel that proper construction of the statute says that if the liability standards from the statutes certainly, then the corresponding right to be reimbursed must also be predicated upon that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.746" offset="9074395">The -- and I feel that the petitioner's principal complaint here is that he doesn't have a complete remedy under the Longshoreman's Act by reason of the fact that if he takes under that Act is the assignee or the subrogee of the employee's claim then he will be limited to the $30,000.00 maximum recovery which was permitted under Illinois law in effect to the time of this accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.618" offset="9189857">However, it is maintained that the employers are as carriers, insurance carriers potential liability is $70,000.00 therefore he is going to be at least $40,000.00 out of pocket rate -- right away if he cannot find a way to get around the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.158" offset="9292048">I believe that this question, this possibility or likelihood that there would be cases in which the injured employee in bringing his cause of action against a negligent third party, there were cases in which he would recover less from the negligent third party than he might against -- as a right -- result of his entitlement to compensation benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.064" offset="9399672">The Congress covered this in subsection (f) of Section 33.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.668" offset="9434049">It isn't in the appendix but it is in the petitioner's brief on page 3 of petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.369" offset="9476890">In contemplating what would occur when there was a deficiency in the employees recovery, the Congress did not say or did not enact that the employer or his compensation carrier might have a separate cause of action or additional cause of action against the negligent third party to recover the deposit that it might have from its right to be reimbursed from -- or to recover from the employees recovery but instead in protecting the employee it said that the employer shall pay to the employee any deficiency between whatever it recovers from the negligent third party and what it was entitled to under the compensation act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.036" offset="9659538">The Act, I think it's designed to protect employees rather than employers to some extent anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.418" offset="9693080">We feel that the Congress in enacting this statute specified -- set forth a particular manner in which reimbursement could be achieved by the employer and we feel that the mode of reimbursement under the statute is very, very plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.480" offset="9777298">The compensation statutes have been consistently interpreted to cover the entire area of industrial injuries and basically where Congress has provided a means of recovery, I don't think it's necessary to go outside the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.966" offset="9855248">I think the recovery must be found within the four corners of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.735" offset="9870294">We certainly we feel that Congress did not intend that there should be two recoveries for a single tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.442" offset="9897148">The second aspect of this question is before the Court is how can the -- or what rules do govern this area of indemnity?</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.513" offset="9961409">I think it's clear from the decisions of this Court beginning with Ryan going under Weyerhaeuser, Crumady that indemnity in these cases must be predicated entirely upon contractual warranty.</text>

            <text syncTime="4016.609" offset="16169775">I would like to point out to the Court that respondent recognize that changing the law here would perhaps have a decided impact on the industry and that Ryan changed the law existent up to that time and had as have been enacted under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act long before the advent of Ryan.</text>
            <text syncTime="4049.258" offset="16300387">I would like to point out to the Court that the position of the law now is in the Ninth Circuit, affirmed by the Ninth Circuit, the Hugev case makes the very definite statement that the law prompt the holding that the ex -- the absent a span, they expressed a provision to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4074.167" offset="16400071">The shipowner owes to the stevedoring contractor under the stevedoring contract the implied in fact obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4085.769" offset="16446464">The Ninth Circuit holds there is an implied in fact contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4089.883" offset="16462869">The Seventh Circuit holds there is none.</text>
            <text syncTime="4093.743" offset="16478333">We ask this Court to clarify the law and we urge that there is this implied in fact contract under which duties flow both ways.</text>
