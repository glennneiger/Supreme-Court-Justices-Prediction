            <text syncTime="16.148" offset="167999">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.636" offset="197883">I feel in closing I would like to stress and accentuate two points as to which we feel very strongly about.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.723" offset="238216">First, we feel that there must be an accommodation made between the laws of the Secretary of Interior and the compact itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.898" offset="282937">Otherwise, we fear deeply that there will be irreconcilable conflicts on the streets of Washington served by carriers subject to our jurisdiction and those operating pursuant to the franchise of the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.751" offset="354408">We feel that someone must be in position to resolve any irreconcilable conflicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.504" offset="377396">On the one hand and on the other hand to coordinate and improve in every fashion all of this transportation service.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.533" offset="417520">This may be accomplished not by accepting the argument of the petitioners that the Secretary's laws are mutually exclusive and cannot be app -- in the compact cannot be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.303" offset="468616">We feel there isn't only that there will be no mischief, no harm done if the court accepts the view of the Commission that there is -- that the compact is applicable that dual jurisdiction does exist that on the one hand, the Secretary of Interior has those ministerial duties and the right to organize and supervise his transit service on the Mall or between any part properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.222" offset="580211">On the other hand, we feel that the Congress very clearly did not intend that any public transportation service would be excluded from the regulation by the Transit Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="131.846" offset="630784">I thought you told us yesterday that if the Secretary of Interior did it himself that the Commission would have no jurisdiction.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="150.480" offset="705285">What is the difference?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="russell_w_cunningham" startTime="151.924" stopTime="247.311">
            <label>Mr. Russell W. Cunningham</label>
            <text syncTime="151.924" offset="711032">The difference is Mr. Chief Justice that I feel that Congress when it enacted the exemption by the Federal Government or the signatories intended to leave a small area open whereby the Government could operates its own service and follow the traditional regulatory scheme -- statutory regulatory scheme that where the Government itself provides a service that that service is not in turn regulated by another governmental agents that on the other hand where it does require a private carrier to provide that same service, then that service must be regulated and that is the holding in the U.S.A.C. Transport case.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.644" offset="865991">That has been the holding if every Supreme Court cases, state court decision that I know of sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.753" offset="894412">This is the primary distinction I think clearly that this was scheme that existed prior to the enactment of the compact and that those -- what Congress in the state legislatures intended to be accomplished in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.920" offset="943104">Now we don't feel that there will be any problem arising under this dual jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.733" offset="970271">The regulatory agency in most instances accepts the managerial decisions of the owners of transit companies and in this case, the Secretary is free to contract with this concessionaire and supervise it day and night.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.572" offset="1037667">We welcome a service of this kind that we feel that there must be an accommodation between the Secretary Service and melding of that service in the supervision of that service under the regulatory concept by the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="247.311" offset="1092629">But if you are correct, it seems to me that -- and this is not transportation by United States then the exemption -- the exception of in the compact doesn't apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="267.419" offset="1173086">And it seems to me that that the extent of the Secretary's power in that situation be just what you wanted it to be and no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.656" offset="1206000">You would have if you wanted to have exclusive power.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.193" offset="1220106">There wouldn't be any real legal authority of the Secretary, isn't that right?</text>
            <text syncTime="285.139" offset="1243930">If it -- you would be operating at your (Inaudible), I'm not saying that's wrong but this is a legal matter if the compact applies that you have the authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="299.700" offset="1302131">On the one hand, we have the Secretary saying, “I will allow or I will provide certain service on the Mall area and I will exclude what service that I feel there is no rational basis for to be on there.”</text>
            <text syncTime="313.714" offset="1358242">Because this Congress said “I shall administer this property.”</text>
            <text syncTime="317.361" offset="1372766">On the other hand, the Congress has also said “we want the Transit Commission to regulate a unified transit system of all kinds throughout this metropolitan area.”</text>

            <text syncTime="331.572" offset="1429608">Well, why does in fact go so far if you were right and the exemption does not apply as to mean that your commission can exclude this service if it's a transportation service if this choice of the Secretary is to franchise that to a private operator, doesn't it go that far?</text>

            <text syncTime="484.905" offset="2042964">I would like to cover an issue that was not covered but Mr. Cunningham which was referred to by counsel for the appellants in this proceeding namely the issue as to whether not the congressional franchise granted to transit.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.088" offset="2107747">D.C. Transit protect it against such applicants as here today for the for hire transportation operation which Universal proposes perform within the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.534" offset="2161560">D.C. Transit franchise, that's Public Law 757, 70 stat 598 grants a franchise to D.C. Transit to perform a mass transportation service in the district of Columbia and in the areas which go on to comprise the metropolitan district.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.124" offset="2247868">Now that particular authority set out in Section 1 of the said franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.867" offset="2270856">Two other sections in this franchise are maturely important to the issue which I raise namely Section 3 and Section 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.092" offset="2307741">If I may skip Section 3 for a moment, Section 6 grants to D.C. Transit, the additional authority known as charter sightseeing and contract authority within the areas that I have described.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.654" offset="2370017">Now, Section 3 of the compact says that no authority or certificate shall be granted to any applicant for that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.698" offset="2422157">If it intends to operate a given route over in a fixed schedule unless the Commission, that is the WMATC finds that public convenience and necessity demands of such certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.352" offset="2484746">Now, the lower court in treating this question attempted to allude to the fact and did as a matter of fact that mass transit referred solely to transit within the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.868" offset="2546813">Now I am certain that a reading of that Section will show that mass transit was not restricted to transit solely within the District of Columbia or to residents in the District of Columbia but applied to anyone within the areas that we serve and for any of the services that we serve as a result of the franchise and the certificates which were eventually issued to us by the WMATC as a result of the said certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.654" offset="2666036">The Section 3 which becomes the paramount section in this case as far as our argument is concerned definitely points out that the service which they must endeavor to render must be by a given route are over a fixed schedule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1338.949" offset="5459153">The second and completely independent basis for reversal is that the compact by its terms and by any reasonable construction does not extend into the national park enclave and does not purport to regulate activities of the federal government or any contract party it might use in connection with the operations in the Mall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.536" offset="5569494">On this latter does not abate rest upon the exclusion in the compact, it goes to the scope to the heart of the compact itself and I take the legislative history and the language of the compact that is developed in the briefs will make this abundantly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.766" offset="5638457">In the first place, the compact in Article 8 called for Congress to enact legislation that will suspend conflicting federal statutes and to graft jurisdiction to the Commission to carry out the compact so far as necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.736" offset="5710346">In Section 3 of House Joint Resolution 402 consenting to the compact, Congress performed this function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.657" offset="5754023">It granted to the Commission only the authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission and the authority of the Public Utilities Commission.</text>
