            <text syncTime="37.356" offset="252844">In this case, there is presented the issue of whether the Death on the High Seas Act is the exclusive remedy for wrongful death occurring to one of the workers on the artificial islands, fixed platforms, in the Outer Continental Shelf, off of the Coast of Louisiana in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.402" offset="368933">Actually, before the Court today are two cases that came here on a joint petition for a writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.964" offset="399235">The two cases present exactly the same issue in the Owlet Budrow Rodrigue case.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.400" offset="429014">She is suing-- she and her children are suing on-- for the death of her husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.308" offset="460570">Budrow Rodrigue fell from the top of a derrick to his death on the drilling platform floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.760" offset="510412">It is alleged that the death was caused by the negligence of the operator of the platform and the drilling company.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.713" offset="562239">In the Dore case-- or let met continue and bring the Rodrigue case up to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.298" offset="604557">Before the death, Mrs. Rodrigue brought actually three suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.633" offset="621902">She brought one suit under the Death on the High Seas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.267" offset="636426">This suit was brought in admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.419" offset="645099">She brought two civil action claiming that the Louisiana Death Act, which was the adjacent state in this case, and the Rodrigue death occurred on a platform which was 28 miles seaward of the Coast of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.205" offset="728168">In these civil actions, Mrs. Rodrigue contended that the Louisiana Death Act was extended to these artificial islands by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act which specifically provides that the law of the adjacent state shall be extended to the artificial islands in the Outer Continental Shelf and shall be applied when not inconsistent with a federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.968" offset="839241">The cases were consolidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.278" offset="852511">Motions were filed by the defendants to dismiss all of the claims actually contending that one of the other was an exclusive remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="198.311" offset="896606">The case was fixed for trial with the jury to hear the civil actions, the judge to hear the admiralty action concurrently.</text>

            <text syncTime="395.797" offset="1686549">In the Dubois Dore case, the defendants, at the District Court level, filed a motion to strike the Louisiana cause of action and to strike all claims or none pecuniary damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.674" offset="1754049">The district judge granted this motion and then certified the question that's raised in a motion to the Fifth Circuit so that, actually, the Dore case reached the Fifth Circuit before the Rodrigue case, though both involved exactly the same issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.673" offset="1814026">In the Fifth Circuit, the Court held that the exclusive remedy for a death was the Death on the High Seas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.789" offset="1854568">If this Court had granted the certiorari, the Rodrigue case actually followed the Dore case very promptly.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.699" offset="1902216">The Court in the Rodrigue case issued a per curiam opinion and simply referred to our decision in the Dore case.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.130" offset="1931891">It is our contention that the Fifth Circuit erred in holding that the Death on the High Seas Act is the exclusive remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.110" offset="1963760">The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act specifically extends the law of the adjacent state to the particular islands and it is to be applied where not in consistent with the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.586" offset="2025723">Now, the holding that the Death on the High Seas Act was an exclusive remedy is clearly an error because the Death on the High Seas Act specifically provides that it is not an exclusive remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.933" offset="2083088">Section 7 of the Death on the High Seas Act reads the provisions of any state statute giving or regulating rights of action or remedies for death shall not be affected by this chapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.355" offset="2152782">Now, it's hard to see how anything could be clearer than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.568" offset="2169605">Now, at the time of the adoption of the Death on the High Seas Act, there were some state statutes which were construed as giving rights of action for Death on the High Seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.703" offset="2214222">The most famous of these cases is the Hamilton.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.766" offset="2238464">Also, there we -- there happen to be a case, the E.B. Ward, Jr. which was a Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals case applying the very same Louisiana Death Act that's at issue here to a death which occurred in a collision between two vessels in the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.604" offset="2305755">Both of these cases were on the books at the time of the adoption of the Death on the High Seas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.655" offset="2329997">The clarity of this specific statement in the Death on a High Seas Act that it shall not affect the rights given by state statutes is highlighted by the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.900" offset="2394990">At the time that this Bill, it was a Senate Bill when it was in the House just before the passage, at that time, there was a debate as to whether the Act should be an exclusive remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.942" offset="2455176">At that point, Section 7, which I have just read to you, provided that the provisions of any state statute giving or regulating rights of action are remedies for death shall not be affected by this Act as to causes of action accruing within the territorial limits of any state.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.117" offset="2543888">Now, that made it clear that there was a limitation upon this -- what the Act was going to affect.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.930" offset="2595088">However, those last words as to causes of action accruing within the limits of any state were deleted after argument and after debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.721" offset="2642213">They were deleted so that the Act would read that the provisions of any state statute given -- giving or regulating rights of action are remedies for death shall not be affected by this Act without any limiting feature.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.064" offset="2703653">Now, it is true that during that debate some of the people who debated said that this Act should be exclusive, some said that it shouldn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.547" offset="2741582">Actually, the final blow on the amendment was 201 in favor of the amendment to 75 against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.252" offset="2796335">Counsel for respondents seems to take comfort from the fact that some of the persons who debated gave some reasons why they thought that the amendment shouldn't be passed or that if it passed, it didn't make any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.307" offset="2868642">But, the fact is that there were 201 as opposed to 75 of the legislators who voted for this amendment so that the Act would plainly read that the provisions of any state statute giving or regulating rights of action or remedies for death shall not be affected by this Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1004.099" offset="4119803">The conflicts of laws rules of the State of Delaware would have to be looked to, and if they gave a remedy under those circumstances, the remedy would be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.917" offset="4159091">Now, it was also pointed out in that debate that the State of Massachusetts had different conflicts of law or rules and they discussed one of the men from Massachusetts got up and said “well, in such-and-such a case there was a collision but the ship was owned by a Massachusetts corporation, but the other ship was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.535" offset="4237563">It was owned by a different state and that the rules were hopelessly in conflict, and they gave no remedy.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2046.455" offset="8289155">The issue here before us is narrowed down to the question as to whether the Death on the High Seas Act which restricts recovery to pecuniary loss can be supplemented by the law on the adjacent state.</text>

            <text syncTime="2068.701" offset="8378180">Yes, Your Honor, that is a correlative issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.257" offset="8400436">In the Rodrigue -- I would like to mention, in the Rodrigue case, there were two civil actions filed and there was an admiralty action filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.706" offset="8438157">The two civil actions were dismissed by a motion to dismiss by Judge West, and those are the only two decisions which are here before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.905" offset="8482983">The admiralty action was tried on the merits and judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff on pecuniary loss, and that action is not before the Court here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.552" offset="8525615">Now, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the Budrow Rodrgue case as it affirmed the Dore cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.744" offset="8558320">These two cases have in common the fact that both occurred on the Outer Continental Shelf or the marine league from shore and the actions are both against third parties non-employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.882" offset="8618924">The plaintiffs' attorney has attempted to use two avenues by which to incorporate the state law, that those two avenues are the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and the Death on the High Seas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.489" offset="8697292">The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act provides, as set forth on page 7 and 8 of our brief in division (a) (1), that the laws applicable to these artificial islands are as the -- are the federal constitutions -- the federal constitution and the federal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.950" offset="8791124">It then provides that, to the extent that the state law is applicable and to the extent that the state law is not inconsistent, then the state laws may be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.902" offset="8847026">And, it also provides that the Executive Department of the United States is to define by extending theoretical boundaries into the ocean what adjacent laws are to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.675" offset="8906062">Up to my knowledge, the Executive Department has not projected that the state boundary is out into the ocean and not into the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.757" offset="8950366">Insofar as the Submerged Lands Act which unquestionably applies here, the plaintiffs' attorney, in order to have the state law adopted as a federal law, must meet these three requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.254" offset="9012433">The first requirement is, does the state law apply?</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.837" offset="9030719">One of the first things that I'm learning of constitutional law is that where there is federal legislation in a field that the federal legislature is competent to legislate upon, it supersedes those state laws which had been previously incorporated by federal law in order to provide a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.927" offset="9107101">This Court, in Lynn Grennan -- the Lynn Grennan case and also in the Glasby versus United States Steel Corporation case, in which Justice Black was the organ of the Court, there, reiterated the principle that where the federal legislature has preempted the field previously occupied by state law and can competently do so, then, the state law is superseded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.256" offset="9228413">Now, the Lynn Grennan case is very applicable to this case at Bar because, in that case, a seaman was killed as a result of an accident which occurred in Virginia waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.034" offset="9287555">And, he was survived only by a niece and a nephew who were not dependent upon the seaman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.557" offset="9321618">The plaintiffs' attorney stated that he had the right to recover for general damages under the Virginia Wrongful Death action as a supplementary law to the Jones Act, which is exactly what is being argued here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.563" offset="9389641">In the Lynn Grennan decision, the United States Supreme Court held that the Jones Act that'd been legislated in order to provide this field of law previously covered by state ter -- by state law and, therefore, that the Jones Act superseded the wrongful death action even to the extent of ruling out general damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.687" offset="9478144">34 years later, this Court in the Glasby again affirmed the Lynn Grennan decision, but separate and apart from the general field of federal preemption is a question that there are three decisions by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals which are the Loffland Brothers versus Roberts, Ocean Drilling and Exploration Company versus Berry Brothers, and Pure Oil Company versus Snipes cited on page 9 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.170" offset="9612100">In which, the First Circuit has held, and this Court has approved since writs of certiorari were denied in each one of these cases, has held that on the Outer Continental Shelf under Section (a) (1) of Title 1333 -- of Section 1333, it is a federal maritime law that is to apply to personal injury litigation and that the state law has no application whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.819" offset="9730696">So that, in personal injury litigation, insofar as the stationary platforms, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, as adopting federal maritime law, governs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.339" offset="9808750">Therefore, the state law apply?</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.141" offset="9819930">The state law does not apply because it has been superseded by the Federal Death on the High Seas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.406" offset="9852949">Even if this Court were to hold that state law is to apply, the second requirement written into the submer -- the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act is that the state law, before it can be adopted, has to be consistent with federal laws then existing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.017" offset="9927450">Now, I have set forth in this visual aid, as I did in my memorandum, as to a comparison of the various elements of the causes of action provided under the Louisiana law and under the Death on the High Seas Act, the beneficiaries are different, the damages are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.685" offset="10006131">Now, the plaintiffs' attorney says that there is a hiatus in this particular field of law because no general damages are provided by the Death on the High Seas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.522" offset="10057435">I submit to you that the legislature in 1920, the legislature that enacted the Death on the High Seas Act, specifically contemplated the granting of general damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.126" offset="10115845">Judge Putnam -- Chief Justice Putnam of New York, who was the author of the Bill, provided in his original letter to the Congress that the damages were for fair and just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.038" offset="10163493">In 1914, the Legislative Judicial Committee modified -- qualified that language by saying that it was restricted to pecuniary loss and this concept of restricting damages to pecuniary loss is not only applicable in the Death on the High Seas Act, but in the companion case of the Jones Act which was enacted by the same legislature in 1920.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.638" offset="10253876">I therefore submit to you that the Death on the High Seas Act is -- does not provide an incomplete remedy for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.231" offset="10284283">It compli -- it provides for the complete remedy as intended by the legislature, so that there is no hiatus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.704" offset="10318137">Therefore, the two-principle requirements of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act for the adoption of state law, first, its application of state law and, secondly, the fact that the state law cannot be inconsistent, it had not been complied with in this case and, therefore, the state law has no application whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="2588.089" offset="10455751">The Death on the High Seas Act legislative history shows that they intended, at least Judge Putnam did, intended for the Death on the High Seas Act to be the exclusive remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.364" offset="10520848">Now, then, Mann -- Mr. Mann of Illinois, in 1920, made an amendment because he was concerned with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.734" offset="10566301">He says “what about an Illinois constituent in Illinois, does he have to go to New York to a Federal District -- Foreign Federal District Court to assert her remedies?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.787" offset="10606529">He says “I want to preserve to the State Courts their jurisdiction under their own laws for my own constituents to proceed under a state law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.015" offset="10647385">I think that the legislative history and the arguments that were presented by the legislature in pages 20 through 23 of our brief, Your Honor, show that their intention was not to give concurrent jurisdiction, not to give concurrent remedies, but to give alternative remedies.</text>

            <text syncTime="3389.246" offset="13660348">That's correct, Your Honor, and I am saying that I -- that the Fifth Circuit also held that on the basis of the Berry Brothers and the Pure Oil versus Snipes that here were two conditions precedent that had to be met.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.715" offset="13742268">As an alternative argument, Your Honors, as I said in my -- my principle position is that the state law cannot be applied whatsoever under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.488" offset="13785318">But, as an alternate argument, if the Death on the High Seas Act does allow a supplemental remedy, I submit to you that the case cited by opposing counsel, the Higa versus Transocean which he says is in his favor, supports our proposition here because, in Higa, the Court held, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held, as affirmed by this Court in writ of certiorari, that the state law may be applied only where its own Wrongful Death Act provisions give it extraterritorial effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.764" offset="13958457">If that is the case, and that's the case we're going to follow here, I submit to Your Honors that there has been no showing nor can there be any that the Louisiana Wrongful Death Act does not have any extraterritorial effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.638" offset="14009971">A counsel, opposing counsel has cited the E.B. Ward, Jr. and let me say this to you in connection with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.327" offset="14032645">The E.B. Ward, Jr. does not hold that Louisiana Wrongful Death Act has extraterritorial effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.307" offset="14056573">The E.B. Ward, Jr. held, at a time when the Death on the High Seas Act was not in effect, that because of the fact that the Shelf, the E.B. Ward, was a Louisiana Shelf, it was Louisiana territory so that it could be governed by the laws of the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.257" offset="14228355">In conclusion, Your Honors, I respectfully request that the decision of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals be affirmed because the controlling statute is the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, that there are patent inconsistencies in the state law and in the federal law as to beneficiaries, statute of limitations, contribution among joint tort fees and, as was held by this ca -- by this Court in the Tungus, you have to take the state law in its entirety and not just those parts of it which benefit you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.234" offset="14376312">So, if we're going to take this cause of action provided under Article 2315, each and every one of those elements is inconsistent and contradictory to the elements of the cause of action provided under the Death on the Highs Seas Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3587.894" offset="14454993">I'll take the discussion of the Higa case first.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.896" offset="14466905">In the Higa case, Mr. Higa died on an airplane enroot from California to Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.211" offset="14492191">He died when the plane crash in the middle of the ocean.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.266" offset="14504417">His dependants, survivors, filed suit under the Death on the High Seas Act and also claimed a civil action as we are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.932" offset="14547048">The Court -- the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Higa case first said “we are looking to see whether the Conflicts of Laws Rules of Hawaii apply,” and this is -- they took special note that the airplane was owned by a California company and said “no.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.013" offset="14627401">They then said there is no statute that would apply the Hawaii Death Act to this area and there is no decisional law that would apply under Conflicts of Laws Rules, the Hawaii Death Act, to this death.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.832" offset="14694693">Now, in our case, we have both.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.076" offset="14703679">We've got a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.072" offset="14707649">We've got the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and we also have our Death on the High Seas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.582" offset="14725726">Snipes and Loffland Brothers, which are cited as this Circuit's holdings, did not hold that federal law is the exclusive remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.332" offset="14752684">They only held that state law was not exclusive remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.164" offset="14764074">In both of those cases, the defendant says the man's action must be dismissed under state law because he was contributory and negligent in one case and because the state's statute of limitations had run in the other, but the Court said “no, that's not true, that the state remedy is not his exclusive remedy and that he does have a federal remedy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.589" offset="14841710">Those cases didn't say the federal remedy is exclusive.</text>
