            <label>Mr. John P. Frank</label>
            <text syncTime="11.614" offset="149817">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.637" offset="165909">We heard the Solicitor General yesterday expressed his concern that the decision of the Ninth Circuit in this matter has somehow exempted all securities and securities transactions of insurance companies from regulation under the applicable Securities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.115" offset="255875">It is our belief and our argument to you that the Government gives this case an overbreadth that the Solicitor General may not be so concerned over the extreme range which he reads in the opinion which in our view is not truly there.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.465" offset="337272">May we make perfectly clear that we have never -- I’ve been on this case for over four years and presented all of its arguments with my partners here, we have never doubted the general powers of the SEC over insurance company securities nor suggested making of the sort nor have the opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.738" offset="410311">We have no doubt at all that the registration of a public offering of an insurance company is required by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.417" offset="441031">Indeed, these very briefs give citations of the manners in which this very company has had its public offering subject to registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.691" offset="478124">We have no doubt that the insider disclosure provisions in connection with purchaser sale of company securities apply fully to insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.851" offset="514800">We have no doubt that all of the regulations as to the daily trading by insurance companies are fully applicable or that registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as well as the 1933 Act in connection with the sale of variable annuities is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.098" offset="587734">It is our view that this is a decision which was accurately described by, let’s take an independent reader, Judge Harlan’s in the Southern District of New York recently had occasion to apply this Ninth Circuit case in a wholly different manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.290" offset="656488">And he says, speaking of this case in that case, the one we’re talking about, the Securities and Exchange Commission sought to invalidate the merger of two stock life insurance companies on the ground that the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 were violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.744" offset="742379">What National Securities this case held was that the federal statute did not govern because it impaired a detailed state regulatory scheme specifically and directly aimed at the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.886" offset="818866">Now let me give you briefly the account as we see it of what happened and what the issue is and how it comes here.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.777" offset="854497">What it happened was that in late 19 or in the year 1964, an Arizona Company National Life was largely owned by another concerned National Securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.817" offset="906637">National Securities people bought in on a second Arizona company.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.178" offset="928057">It bought stock in a company called Producers Life.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.708" offset="942164">And late in the year 1964, a merger proposal was made to merge these two companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.349" offset="976750">Now let me say a word about the Arizona laws to insurance company mergers, what happens just as under our statutes is that first there must be approval by the directors of the two companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.971" offset="1027218">Then the matter is put up to shareholder vote in each company.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.754" offset="1050415">Thereafter, if it is approved by the shareholders, the matter then goes to the Director of Insurance and he must review the legality of the proposal and specifically under our code must consider it from the standpoint of general legality under our laws and in terms of the interest of shareholders specifically as well as the policyholders, and the merger becomes effective on his approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.196" offset="1160129">Now, what happened was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.813" offset="1166608">The directors did approve.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.178" offset="1172041">The matter went to the national shareholders they approved without question.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.298" offset="1188551">The matter then went to the producer shareholders and there, there was a considerable contest.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.471" offset="1209240">And there was a minority group which filed lawsuits and contested and there was ripsnorting good proxy fight to determine how those shareholders would vote on the question of this merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.386" offset="1260962">Thereupon, the SEC early in 1965 filed this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.517" offset="1289488">And the action which was filed was filed exclusively under Section 10 (b) of the 1934 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.592" offset="1321775">And under Rule 10b-5 which I will be speaking about principally and the action at that time I should mention and this point may be important in view of what the Solicitor General said yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.606" offset="1373811">The action was brought against our clients, the people who were promoting the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.502" offset="1397426">But it was also brought against the original sellers, the people from whom we have bought.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.562" offset="1417592">The so-called selling directors and I asked that that be held in mind for just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.139" offset="1443924">The action was brought but the thrust of the action as brought was that it was to enjoin the merger and to the shareholders meeting and to enjoin letting the matter be presented to the Arizona Director of Insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.578" offset="1505677">Now, what happened was that an ex parte order was issued which we have no notice that is to say which did restrain these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.620" offset="1545801">And thereupon, we filed the usual motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.055" offset="1559594">And the matter came on before Federal District Judge Mathes and at that point, the court dismissed as to the selling directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.009" offset="1611421">And the selling directors are not in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.358" offset="1620825">They’re not in the case now in any way and there has never been an appeal from the order in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.211" offset="1648201">And the matter which was turned was simply the question of whether our clients could be enjoined from going forward with this merger and specifically could be enjoin from presenting the matter that the shareholders whose meeting was in suspense waiting for the order of the Court as to whether they can vote on the merger whether they could.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.863" offset="1722807">Now in those circumstances, the essence of the complaint as made by the SEC as fairly summarize in the Government’s brief was that there was objection to four elements of the proxy solicitation which had been going forward in connection with this merger in connection with the shareholders meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.355" offset="1816743">And there were, as I said there had been minority shareholders suit and you can see from the record that the matter came on and the crowded courtroom before Judge Mathes with the minority shareholders present, the SEC present and Judge Mathes said “No, I believe that this is a matter as to whether this merger can go forward which properly has to be taken up with the Director of Insurance in this state.”</text>
            <text syncTime="454.331" offset="1920711">If the shareholders approved of it then Judge Mathes turned to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.319" offset="1940668">We asked that you stipulate that there will be a fair period of time and that you’ll give notice to the SEC so that the SEC can present to the Arizona Insurance Commissioner any facts which it regards as relevant or important in connection with this merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.017" offset="2011408">And he broadly admonished the shareholders present if any of them are dissatisfied and the SEC that they should take their problem to the Arizona Director of Insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.658" offset="2045994">Thereupon, he vacated substantially all of the term of the operative portions of the temporary restraining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.513" offset="2073475">And at that point, the matter did come on before the stockholders who overwhelmingly approved the proposed merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.456" offset="2105240">And the matter went over to the Arizona Director of Insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.820" offset="2122689">And at that point we did as we have agreed we would serve notice on the SEC that it was being presented to the Director of Insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.852" offset="2154768">And the SEC thereupon presented to the Director of Insurance all of the papers that are in this case, its pleadings, its affidavits, and all other matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.414" offset="2201057">And sent them down with the suggestion that Director of Insurance should take these things into account in deciding whether to permit the merger or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.172" offset="2236061">Thereupon, after a reasonable period, of time, the Arizona Insurance Director did approve the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.696" offset="2274200">And at that point, the Commission which had sought no stay there had not gone to other circuit had not come here, thereupon amended its complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.424" offset="2317040">I got leave to amend and did amend.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.050" offset="2327594">And it then presented and amended complaint and in the light of the comments of the Solicitor General, I think that perhaps would be worthy of noting that the amended complaint and its operative portions of course contained in the appendix and all I wish to say is that what the amended complaint asked for was that the merger be nullified.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="578.865" offset="2418813">Where is that in the record?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_p_frank" startTime="580.043" stopTime="919.499">
            <label>Mr. John P. Frank</label>
            <text syncTime="580.043" offset="2423515">That is at page 99, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.371" offset="2436890">And you’ll see there that what they asked at the top of the page was that, no steps be taken toward the merger while the merger was already done.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.580" offset="2469700">That it become obsolete.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.391" offset="2476910">The next paragraph is that the merger should be nullified and that the whole thing should be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.319" offset="2508675">Then in the remaining paragraph, there is a passage which relates to the original contract of purchase but that was of no consequence because that was directed at our clients and their actions and the actions of the selling directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.327" offset="2588714">But the selling directors weren’t parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.943" offset="2599163">The SEC moved to rejoin them as parties but that motion was denied and they never appealed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.567" offset="2621628">And what they asked for in the remainder was in effect steps which would further nullify the merger and undo the action that was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.359" offset="2652766">Now, really the precise question which is here is not some broad issue about the relationship of the securities laws in the insurance industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.567" offset="2693622">What is before this Court, what has been before the parks below is simply this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.984" offset="2715355">Does Rule 10 (b) 5 give the SEC power to stop or reverse a merger of insurance companies on the ground of asserted misleading proxy solicitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.399" offset="2780975">And we say the answer to that question is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.421" offset="2797066">And we say no on three independent grounds. Anyone of which is sufficient for the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.130" offset="2827891">We say no first of all on the ground that the McCarran Act in the light of the Arizona statute bars this intervention by Federal Court and by the SEC and the Ninth Circuit and the District Court took that point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.617" offset="2905840">Second, we say as a wholly independent ground that the whole thrust of what the SEC was seeking to do is here is to enjoin the merger or set it aside on the ground of some alleged improprieties to the proxies.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.392" offset="2976893">But they bring this action under Section 10 under Rule 10 (b) 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.836" offset="2998732">And Section 10 and Rule 10 (b) 5 don’t deal with proxies.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.046" offset="3015555">There’s a wholly different Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.805" offset="3022555">A Section 14 which does deal with proxies.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.492" offset="3037288">And this is important because that I’m going to develop it in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.536" offset="3053484">The proxy rules and provisions did not apply to this particular insurance company at this time at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.208" offset="3080234">That would not take effect until the year 1966 and more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.464" offset="3097266">Congress had expressly provided that by a different Act which was not mentioned yesterday but which is discussed in the briefs into which I’ll come back has expressly provided that insurance company proxy solicitations are to be subject to state control.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.614" offset="3157870">And the Ninth Circuit in general took our position on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.213" offset="3176260">Then there was a third ground which we advanced and I’d like to have that clearly in focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.516" offset="3213458">Rule 10 (b) 5 applies only to the purchased and sale of securities and if therefore there wasn’t any purchase or sale then there is no scope, no place of operation for the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.444" offset="3277197">And the real question in the case therefore at the Lower Court stage was whether a so called statutory merger was a sale of securities at all, and hence, whether it was within the scoped of the statute in this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.513" offset="3357445">And as I will develop in just a moment when Mr. Justice Douglas was at the Commission, when Justice Fortas was at the Commission, the Commission took the view that a statutory merger was not a purchase or sale and the Ninth Circuit had expressly so held on the basis of a recommendation of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.817" offset="3438634">And so on, and in more recent years the Commission has reversed itself, and abandon that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.683" offset="3462144">And now seems to extend Rule 10 (b) 5 to mergers.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.818" offset="3478653">So one of the questions what the SEC said in the Ninth Circuit was the most important question in the case was whether the Ninth Circuit would overrule its earlier opinion on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.505" offset="3525360">The Ninth Circuit did not need to decide that particular question having decided the McCarran Act question.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.306" offset="3548557">Now, one problem which is before this Court is, how many of these independent grounds will it consider?</text>
            <text syncTime="868.728" offset="3578232">And we respectfully submit that it should consider them all.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.158" offset="3595995">The Government says no, it should not consider the Rule 10 (b) 5 or this purchase on sale problem because it was not expressly decided by the Ninth Circuit citing to an opinion of Justice White which typically holds that where there are complex factual issues, which were not considered at the Circuit, then this Court may in its discretion remand to permit those complex factual questions to be considered rather than consider them here.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.389" offset="3712920">But the purchase and sale problem is not accomplished factual question.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.925" offset="3731101">It is a pure question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.620" offset="3737893">There is no factual record.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.117" offset="3743848">The matter went off on affidavits and a motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.952" offset="3755133">And we submit therefore that in your discretion this is an independent ground for decision which it may properly consider.</text>

            <text syncTime="1888.087" offset="7655737">Mr. Justice Fortas, all I can say is that if that was the Commission’s point of view now, it was not the Commission’s point of view when it presented the 1964 Act to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.364" offset="7696802">Because in the 1964 hearings, they went in and they said, we need this legislation for the purpose of controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.058" offset="7727626">Proxy solicitations in connection with mergers and they expressly said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.633" offset="7745912">And at no point did they say now we already have this power in some respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.302" offset="7764616">Or we have it for regulatory purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.885" offset="7774960">We have it for any purpose rather they went to Congress saying that they needed this power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.211" offset="7796172">And now in this case they tell us that they had it all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.219" offset="7812263">I have not, I’d like if I may to mention, only to wined up Mr. Chief Justice because my time is done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.131" offset="7847894">I bring to your attention expressly that Congress has repeatedly had before it the question of whether it ought to take hold of insurance mergers and has decided to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.576" offset="7893661">We quote a report of the Senate Judiciary Committee in which that committee expressly takes up the subject to mergers and says, “This is clearly an area where amendments to the McCarran Act may be needed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.459" offset="7949249">But none such have been passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.645" offset="7961997">I will not have the opportunity of discussing with you Your Honors, the sale problem because of the expiration of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.593" offset="7989791">But I commend that to your consideration in the briefs which we have presented to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.617" offset="8009853">I repeat, when Mr. Justice Douglas and Mr. Justice Fortas were with the Commission, their position was that these provisions of law did not apply to mergers at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.199" offset="8056142">It is our position that if it is to be applied to mergers such it certainly not be retroactive as against the company such as ours which could not possibly reasonably been expected to know that that was the law when it faced these problems, I would leave the matter, Your Honors with simply these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.100" offset="8139734">How could the SEC more totally supersede our law by doing what is it doing here and the answer is, I think it would be impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.371" offset="8172857">It runs a snowplow straight to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.153" offset="8183933">The real question is who has the power to decide whether two insurance companies may merge or not the most fundamental conceivable question in the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.777" offset="8226461">But with special attention to the mattes which Justice Fortas has raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.924" offset="8247045">Why did the SEC tell Congress in 1964 that it needed the proxy amendment to reach mergers it already have that power?</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.601" offset="8289782">And finally, I think the most serious question of all under the McCarran Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.187" offset="8316113">Why did Congress, and this relates to the colloquy with Justice White, why did Congress expressly provide in the 1964 Act that insurance proxy solicitation should be under state control if intended insurance proxy solicitations to be under federal control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.179" offset="8396048">Thank you very much.</text>
