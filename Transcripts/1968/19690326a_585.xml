            <label>Mr. Edward J. Simerka</label>
            <text syncTime="35.628" offset="245844">Excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.948" offset="247202">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.990" offset="275310">We would like to get immediately into the reason why we are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.993" offset="303313">In December of 1965, the Teamsters Union lost an NLRB Election which was held among employees classified as journeymen wire weavers at our plant on Holyoke, Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.048" offset="379591">They voted seven against the Union and six for the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.516" offset="405400">Now, even though the Union lost the election, the Labor Board ordered us to bargain with it and why did the Labor Board do this?</text>
            <text syncTime="86.953" offset="451166">They did it because of our words, because of what we said to our employees prior to a conduct of this election.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.372" offset="492857">Unlike the other cases that have been heard this afternoon, there were no discharges, there was no interrogation, there was no surveillance, and there were no promises of benefit by the employer in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.323" offset="560671">Now, during the organizing campaign, President David Sinclair made two speeches to the employees and he wrote about eight letters for handbills.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.006" offset="619395">Now, in its decision, the Board could not find a single statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.726" offset="650324">They couldn't find a single sentence or a single communication which they could characterize as being unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.550" offset="685537">So, instead, what the Board said in fact was that even though each of the employer's statements was lawful by itself considered separately, we, the Board in our expertise seating here in Washington will decide that the totality of all these lawful statements however are unlawful and are coercive, and that is why we are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.223" offset="812283">It is our position that our communications to our employees were lawful and protected not only by Section 8 (c) of the Taft-Hartley Act but also by the First Amendment of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.448" offset="869125">Now, we would like to meet the issues head-on and if I may, I would like to direct the Court's attention to page 21 of the Board's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.692" offset="922102">The Board's attorneys call attention on page 21 of their brief to five points that allegedly were made by President David Sinclair in petitioner's communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.946" offset="975182">I'm using the term Board's attorneys advisedly because the Board nowhere indicated that it relied upon these five points or upon any other points.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.426" offset="1025128">The only finding that we have from the Board is that by petitioner's series of communications that when they were considered as a whole that these were coercive but the Board at no time ever indicated as to what it was specifically that we had said at narrative proscription.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.850" offset="1098794">That's why I point to page 21 of the Board's brief because the Board's attorneys point to five points which they say we made and these five points I gather which made -- allegedly made our communications coercive in the Board's view.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.369" offset="1188864">Now, of course the Board's attorneys merely expanded upon an approach taken by the court below which did much the same thing relying upon four points.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.466" offset="1233272">Again, which there are no evidence were relied on by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.897" offset="1255006">Now, we submit that each of the five statements or points that are referred to in the Board's brief were lawful and protected by Section 8 (c) and by the First Amendment of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.221" offset="1304221">Point number one, for example is that the 1952 strike left the company in a state of continuing financial difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.060" offset="1343613">Now, of course the facts in our case are that we did have a union for journeymen and at the time apprentice wire weavers up until 1952 and there was a 13-week strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.450" offset="1405158">And in our communications, we told the employees that the 1952 strike of 13 weeks duration had left the company in a continuing state of financial difficulty and we submit that this statement is perfectly lawful and proper under Section 8 (c) of the Act by no stretch of the imagination can it be acclaimed to contain a threat or force or reprisal on our part, certainly is not a promise of benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.217" offset="1516231">Further, the statement is amply supported by the record and I point out that this Court has held that no test of truth can be administered either by judges or juries or by administrative agencies when questions of free speech were involved but the record does support this statement and it shows that the financial difficulties over the years became so severe that in 1964 President David Sinclair was forced to sell his family-owned company.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.363" offset="1648828">Now, we assume that even the Board will agree with us that statement number one which the Board is relying on is a statement lawful and protected under 8 (c) and under the First Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="403.598" offset="1717791">It's on page 21, Your Honor, of the Board.</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="408.365" offset="1736808">Alright.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edward_j_simerka" startTime="410.501" stopTime="759.472">
            <label>Mr. Edward J. Simerka</label>
            <text syncTime="410.501" offset="1745377">Now, the second statement that the Board relies upon is a statement that a petitioner stated that a union would make unreasonable demands which the company could not meet and then its only recourse would be a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.930" offset="1811101">Well, I'm not going to quibble over the wording.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.979" offset="1823326">We made statements substantially to of that nature in the course of the pre-election campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.644" offset="1853942">But we submit that anyone knows that this statement, that is that if the company cannot meet unreasonable demands that the Union's only recourse is the strike, is a true statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.897" offset="1910993">It doesn't take board expertise to determine this.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.262" offset="1932413">Now, we submit that a statement of this nature also is lawful and protected under Section 8 (c) under the First Amendment of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.211" offset="1980165">To the extent that there may be involved a charge that a union or the Union or the Teamsters Union would make unreasonable demands, we submit that this is lawful and protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.767" offset="2026454">It's a statement relevant to the issues and in Linn against Plant Guards.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.960" offset="2047248">This Court recognized that a wide scope was to be given in a pre-election campaign of charges and counter-charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.837" offset="2078699">Now, and it doesn't take board expertise to know that unions do make unreasonable demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.619" offset="2109837">Everyone knows this.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.670" offset="2114017">This is the name of the game.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.722" offset="2126242">This is the basis upon which negotiations start in any labor management context and the people in the plant know this, and particularly these people and this plant knew it because they'd all been union members back in -- I should amend my statement of all, a majority of them have been members of the union back in 1952 and anyone who negotiates labor contracts as I have know this also.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.723" offset="2234284">Now, in addition, here, there is a background of a strike over unreasonable demands in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.344" offset="2276707">The majority of the employees involved in this election campaign went through the 1952 strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.345" offset="2304711">They knew what the unreasonable demands were back in 1952 that led to that strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.871" offset="2326862">Now, we submit that neither Section 8 (c) nor the Constitution permits the Board to shield employees from something they already know.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.877" offset="2370853">Basically, this is the substance of statement number 2 that is relied upon by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.459" offset="2397184">Now, what else did we do according to the Board's attorneys?</text>
            <text syncTime="576.917" offset="2411081">Three, according to the Board's attorneys, we pointed out to the employees that such a recourse that is unreasonable demands was particularly to be expected from the Teamsters Union which was a strike happy outfit led by racketeers.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.558" offset="2489553">Again, Your Honors, we submit there is no threat or force or reprisal in the statement and that it is fully protected by Section 8 (c) and by the First Amendment of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.326" offset="2544724">Now, what does the record show with regard to facts?</text>
            <text syncTime="614.783" offset="2562487">It shows first of all that the Union that was organizing us was in effect the same union that had struck us for 13 weeks in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.772" offset="2598431">In 1952, our people were represented by the AWWPA, the American Wire Weavers Protective Association which had merged with or been absorbed by the Teamsters Wire Weavers Division which was the entity within the Teamsters Union that sent the initial letter to our employees and began its attempt to organize them in July of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.526" offset="2705429">So the AWWPA which had been swallowed up by the Teamsters was the organizing entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.816" offset="2746598">The authorization cards sent out to the employees authorized the international union to represent these people and also authorized the international to designate or charter any other local to represent.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.835" offset="2810755">The organizational attempts started with the international and the first recognition demand came from the international on August 17th and it was a request made not only by the international but on behalf of the international as shown by our response to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.338" offset="2884733">Any statements with respect to racketeering certainly amply supported by Senator Kennedy's book “The Enemy Within” which we sent to our employees and records of some of the investigating committees and the reference to the Teamsters being a strike happy outfit was supported in our letters to our employees by “directly from Mr. Hoffa himself” in connection with an organizing campaign among telephone installers where he told this people that here, they should be ready to do warfare with their employer for six or nine months or not coming into the Teamsters Union at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.395" offset="3052962">Now, we submit that certainly we have a right to disseminate these facts to our employees with respect to our employee -- with respect to the Teamsters Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.040" offset="3103535">There's no threat or force or reprising.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.998" offset="3115342">We submit that our statements were lawful under Section 8 (c) and under the First Amendment.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="759.472" offset="3141256">Are both the Board and the court below disagreed with you?</text>
            <text syncTime="764.370" offset="3160900">Is that right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edward_j_simerka" startTime="766.577" stopTime="903.604">
            <label>Mr. Edward J. Simerka</label>
            <text syncTime="766.577" offset="3169677">The Board, yes, based on its totality doctrine, the Board did not and as I pointed out earlier did not take these five points because it did not tell us what it us that we had said.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.110" offset="3223803">The Board said merely that through their expertise, the totality of our communications were coercive.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.643" offset="3253896">Now, the Court of Appeals did follow this type of analysis and set forth four different points which we submit do not support the Board's order in any event or its findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.736" offset="3314291">However, the court below merely deferred to the Board's expertise and to the test of substantial evidence and we submit that in both of these respects, the court below urged that Board expertise was not in the proper standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.093" offset="3383777">The courts should have reviewed the record itself to determine whether or not there were any improper statement and that substantiality of the evidence was not criterion particularly here when the facts were undisputed and all that was involved where the interpretations or conclusions to be drawn from these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.271" offset="3464443">Now, again I point to this Court's decision in Linn against Plant Guards where this Court pointed out that a great leeway was to be afforded to the combatants or contestants in a pre-election campaign for vigorous (Inaudible) and costly common.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.355" offset="3556812">Now, apparently, in the Board's attorney's do not consider that points one, two, and three add up to an unlawful totality because they've gone on to number five and I assume that one, two, and three would not be sufficient in the Board's view to constitute a violation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.803" offset="3646568">The fourth point the Board points to is the statement to the effect that the another strike could result in closing of the plant as Lindsey would shift work to its Mississippi and Ohio plants if the Sinclair Company did not make a profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.853" offset="3714800">Now --</text>

            <text syncTime="1546.969" offset="6291205">They used our words and our finding on Section 8 (a) (1) as evidence that we did not have a good faith doubt of the Union's majority status.</text>

            <text syncTime="1624.987" offset="6603316">It is our -- as I try to summarize on the bargaining order aspects of the case, it is our contention that the question of good faith doubt is really irrelevant and that the Board said so itself in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.153" offset="6655979">In its order, the Board said that even if we had had a good faith doubt that they would nevertheless have ordered us to bargain anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.875" offset="6690879">So, that the Board itself says that the question of good faith doubt is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.069" offset="6711672">I think the important aspect in this case and in the others of bargaining order is a question of what is the proper remedy for the 8 (a) (1) violation if there is one in this case and we deny that there is one in this case and we deny that there is, or what is the proper remedy in -- for the unfair labor practices that have been found and the Court of Appeals although many of them still using the good faith doubt language have basically directed their attention to this question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1938.171" offset="7856044">These are set forth on page 43 of our brief in the appendix and perhaps, that is a good starting point for assessing the primary contention made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.927" offset="7923127">Under Section 8 (a) (1) of the Act, it is an unfair labor practice for an employer to interfere with restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in Section 7 including the right to a free choice in deciding whether they want to select a representative to represent them in collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.630" offset="8029915">Under Section 8 (c) of the Act, Congress has said that the expressing event of the views, argument or opinion are the dissemination thereof whether in written, printed, graphic or visual form shall not constitute or be evidence of an unfair labor practice under any of the provisions of this Act if such expression contains no threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.531" offset="8149452">Now, read together and in the light of their legislative history, we submit that Congress was saying two things in including both of these provisions in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.630" offset="8205876">One that it wished to guarantee the employer's right to express his views and this is at all times under 8 (c), it's not restricted to the period of the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.811" offset="8258644">And the other thing is that Congress wanted to protect the employees who are economically dependent of the employer from being deprived through threat of reprisal of their freedom of choice in the exercise of their right to choose their bargaining representatives and to bargain collectively if they so desire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.355" offset="8356760">This prohibition of threats of reprisal which exists in the Act as an integral part of the Congress' regulation of the employment relationship, a regulation of the manner in which the terms and conditions of employment will be established under the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2087.398" offset="8452995">Do you suppose the language of the statute goes no further than what the employer already had, a right to do under the First Amendment or does it go further?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="2099.927" offset="8503045">In my view, is that it goes further as would be indicated in decisions of this Court and other areas of economic regulation where there is not a provision comparable to 8 (c) protecting freedom of expression in the relationship, in the economic relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.055" offset="8571591">I -- I think for example, a Federal Trade Commission against Texaco in this term where the Court held that there was inherent coercion in the recommendation by Texaco to its dealers of a particular brand of tires, batteries, and accessories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.975" offset="8639300">Certainly, the Labor Board could not go this far in the face of 8 (c) as the Trade Commission did with this Court sustaining and in that case, in a similar economic context except for the differences in the statutory provision.</text>
