            <label>Mr. Charles Alan Seigel</label>
            <text syncTime="28.437" offset="217109">Yes, Your Honor, justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.683" offset="226095">Mr. Justice, this is a case that was initially instituted in the Eastern District of Missouri by the petitioner, a diversity case brought under the Federal Rule 23, the class action rules seeking to recover for herself and for some 4,000 members of her class a judgment in the amount of $1,200,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.656" offset="353991">The petitioner is the owner of some 2,000 shares of stock of the Missouri Union Fidelity Insurance Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.739" offset="394324">In the petitioner's complaint, it is alleged that the National Western Life Insurance Company entered into an agreement with the controlling members of the Board of Directors of Missouri Fidelity Union Trust Company, Insurance Company, whereby the National Western agreed that they would buy some 300,000 shares of stock owned by the directors and members of the directors family for a premium price of a $1,200,000.00 and by premium price I mean $1,200,000.00 over what the stock was sell for in the market and the condition was, is that these directors resign and that -- and that is what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.404" offset="592959">The directors did resign on the shares being purchased and the nominees and national western were then elected to control to the board of directors and were then elected to control of the executive committee and the financial committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.612" offset="661817">The relief sought in the petition, the complaint was that this $1,200,000.00 should be distributed to the shareholders of Missouri Union Fidelity because that this was an illegal sale of the officers of the directors and it was a breach of trust owed by the directors to the stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.473" offset="769233">The respondent filed a motion to dismiss taking the position in the motion to dismiss that the claim of each member of the class was a separate and distinct claim and that in as much as the claim, the respective amount of the petitioner's case was only $8,740.00 that the jurisdictional amount of $10,000.00 had not been met.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.206" offset="876231">The district judge, District Court sustained this motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.318" offset="892635">This was affirmed by the Court of Appeals and certiorari is applied for and granted to the court on this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.995" offset="923355">The sustaining of this motion to dismiss is what made up the issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.458" offset="945194">The respondents' claim that under the old rule, Federal Rule 23 and of many cases decided before the amended rule of Federal Rule 23, is that you could not aggregate, you cannot aggregate separate and distinct claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.339" offset="1028681">It's the position of the petitioner that amended rule, Federal Rule 23 does awake completely with any designation of separate distinction claims and that under Federal Rule 23 there is provided for one action and one judgment finding on the whole class except those who want to be -- indicate that they want to be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.382" offset="1136933">There is no such thing as separate and distinct claim, therefore aggregation is permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.851" offset="1158771">Now going into a little history, the United States Constitution Article 3 says that the judicial power should be in one Supreme Court and then such inferior courts as the Congress should then designate.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.489" offset="1237347">The Section 2 of the Constitution provides that the judicial powers should extend to matters of citizens of different states.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.457" offset="1277158">Now in the Judicial Act of 1789, there was set forth by Congress the jurisdiction amount of $500.00 for jurisdiction in district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.428" offset="1333060">This has now been extended presently to $10,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.368" offset="1352808">As might be expected after there was set this jurisdictional limit, there came up the problem -- there came the problem as what happens in joinder cases and what happens in class action cases, how do you compute to $10,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.721" offset="1414248">For the courts then looked, they cannot look to statute, there was nothing in the statute a term saying how it should be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.137" offset="1443924">There's nothing in the Constitution so they then look to their rules, the rules of common law and of equity practice as it grew up as to joinder equity practice and also the interpretations to the old amended -- old Federal Rule 23 which really was a codification of the rule, the old rules of common law joinder and of equity practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.151" offset="1544025">And as we go back and to look at the common law rules of joinder class actions and of equity practice, and as also was -- were codified in Federal Rule 23, we find that there was such terms used as joint and common and separate and distinct and the courts came down with this theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.834" offset="1630751">They came down with this theory by looking not at the statutes, not the constitution but at their own procedural rules and they came with this conclusion that if there was a joint action and that would be an action for example when there was an interpretation of a trust, a raise that would be binding and all the parties plaintiff, this was a true class action and therefore aggregation should be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.737" offset="1746317">But if there was a separate and distinct claims, such as the claims which we admit under the prior rule would be this particular case that these could not be aggregated because there could be separate judgments and in every respect under Federal Rule 23, the old Federal Rule 23 and under the old equity and common law practice, the -- even though there was a joinder or clause of class action when there was a separate distinct claims, each claim maintained its own identity.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.198" offset="1876198">This joint and several claims were called spurious claims and in these claims the court would not allow aggregation and again under Federal Rule 23, the old rule Federal 23 is that the only effect of a joinder and a class action whether a separate or distinct claims was that the -- when the person do had a separate distinct claim could intervene in the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.528" offset="1989465">It was not binding on any other members of the class unless the class member actually intervened in the action and the -- there could be separate and distinct judgments and there could be a judgment for plaintiff and it could be against the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.165" offset="2064071">In 19 -- July of 1967, amended Rule 23 was passed and basically the amended Rule 23 provides, is that when the class is so numerous, they're being practical to join all the parties involved and there are common questions of law in fact common to the class and that their claims or defenses common to the class and that the petitioner will fairly represent the class and that the questions of law in fact common to members of the class prevail over any question affecting individual members then a class action may be maintained and then after -- if a judgment is entered, the rule specifically says, the judgment -- does not say the judgments, the judgment in such an action, not in actions, shall describe the member of this class and shall be binding on all members of the class who do not notify the court after being notified by the court that the action is pending that they want to be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.270" offset="2324459">So, as in this particular case if the petitioner was prevailed, there would be one judgment in the amount of $1,200,000.00 and which will be binding on all members of the class except those members who notified the court that they do not want to be included in the judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="938.953" offset="3859205">The respondents have contended that we must look to the old rules as to aggregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.974" offset="3895254">The old rules as to what the courts -- the decisions what the courts held that there could not be aggregation if there were separate distinct claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.024" offset="3927437">We must look to the old federal rule which had this break down and use these terms, a carryover from the old common law and class actions of joint common and several and that as I indicated that if it was a joint claim, there could be aggregation but if it were several, there cannot be.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.657" offset="4009984">Now, that is what the respondents looked to in support of their position.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.208" offset="4028165">But now when the petitioner wants to look at amended Rule 23 to find out that there can be aggregation in the whole claims, the respondents now claim that this is in violation of rule 82 of the federal rules of civil procedure which says that the federal rules cannot expand federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.023" offset="4123460">I submit that if the petitioner in seeking to justify aggregation and rule -- under amended Rule 23 is in violation of expanding jurisdiction then the respondents in looking at the court's interpretation of its own rules, its own common law rules, equity rules and old rule Federal 23 is also in violation of the restrictions of rule 82 which says not only must you not extend jurisdiction, you might not limit jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.749" offset="4278418">Otherwise if we are expanding jurisdiction by looking on amended Rule 83, they are limiting jurisdiction by looking at the old Federal Rule 23 and we're looking at the court's decisions which were handed down before the old Rule 23, obviously a court cannot limit its own jurisdiction but actually what we are not -- we're not really talking about jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.915" offset="4375071">We are talking about procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.178" offset="4396074">The amended Rule 23 in no way seeks to increase or decrease the amount of the $10,000.00 jurisdictional amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.400" offset="4441004">It simply provides a procedure that where in a class action brought under amended Rule 23, there is one binding judgment and this judgment is binding on the whole class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.221" offset="4492204">And we might say that how is it possible in a case such as this one when there is one binding judgment on the whole class which would -- could be in amount of $1,200,000.00 that there is not in controversy, the sum of $10,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.255" offset="4560436">Again, I want to emphasize is that we are talking about one judgment the rule speaks about one judgment and one action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.512" offset="4601396">I've been talking about theory and there is a practical sensibility to the amended Rule 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.972" offset="4639222">A class action really is -- was thought of and enacted and devised to provide a form to get rid of a multitude of cases, decide them all in one case and also it was devised to give a small litigant, a chance to litigate his claim of the makers -- the rule recognized this when they -- in their statements, the advice of committee notes that they were doing their way completely with these terms, joint, common, several, true, spurious and hybrid actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.221" offset="4812257">These were being done away and there was going to be provided new amended Rule 23 would provide it for only one action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.947" offset="4839111">These terms were no longer going to be looked to and I submit that if we take the interpretation as urged by the respondent in this case that there would never be a very seldom ever be brought an action under -- excuse me, the amended class action rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.988" offset="4931375">And as for this reason, the first requirement of amended Rule 23 is that the class be so numerous, that it would be impractical to bring them all before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.393" offset="4976933">I cannot think of any case that I've read or heard about and with there was so many people that suffered independent damages of $10,000.00 that they could not be brought before the court and most of the cases such as the case we are talking about, you find persons who has sustained damages of $500.00, a thousand dollars, in our case, the petitioner in this case was $8,740.00 but in very few case if any will you find so many people that would be impractical to bring the court, each one of them has sustained a $10,000.00 and therefore the position urged by the respondent really completely makes Rule 23, amended Rule 23 a nullity, it will never be used and I suggest and urge this Court that the interpretation urged by the petitioner be adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.465" offset="5189256">That was the intention of the framers of the rule that small litigants haven't formed to litigate their claims and that under the federal -- amended Rule 23 that there would be one action, one judgment binding on all the members of the class that have not chosen to be excluded and certainly in this case, that amount would be for an excess of the $10,000.00 jurisdictional amount.</text>

            <text syncTime="1308.088" offset="5335751">There could be a forum but I think that the litigants are entitled to an impartial forum as provided for -- by the diversity of the citizen -- the citizenship of provisions of our -- of a traditional act of the constitution, pardon me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.982" offset="5403251">And the mere fact that there might be a form in the state court, does not mean that there cannot be also be a form in the federal court and I think it was the intention of the framers to have a rule -- the state courts -- none that I know have this particular rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.761" offset="5474408">I think it was the intention of the framers of amended Rule 23 to provide such a form because it was seen that under the old rule is that no class actions were being brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.718" offset="5526235">The only thing that was happening was, is that when there is a separate and distinct claims that one or two persons would intervene in the case, it was really a method of permissive joinder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.757" offset="5570435">It's all the old class action rule was and it was not a class action in the true sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.486" offset="5593318">It was not designed to do a way and to finally decide a multitude of claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.566" offset="5621635">It was not designed to give as a class action should be to give the small litigant a chance to litigate his claim and I think that was the intention of the framers, I think it is clearly expressed when they -- as I indicated before, the state -- the class must be so numerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.423" offset="5701047">Well, obviously we know that there can never -- that in -- from our practical dealing with life that there would not be so many people and very seldom it would be so many people that would lose $10,000.00 in a transaction it would be impractical to bring it into the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1471.366" offset="5988812">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.745" offset="6006366">I would like to first direct the Court's attention to one particular position that we've adopted in our prosecution of this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.516" offset="6049416">That is and I'll start out with that that the history of the aggregation doctrine leads us as the respondents to the inescapable conclusion that the doctrine, that's the aggregation doctrine is not tied to the federal rules of civil procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.409" offset="6120991">The aggregation doctrine began approximately a hundred years prior to the time that our federal rules were enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.030" offset="6155473">The jurisdiction of our lower courts was established by the legislature and from time to time modified and amended until such times it reached the $10,000.00 limitation that it presently has.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.835" offset="6218689">Admittedly when the federal rules of civil procedure were amended, there was an effort on the part of the advisory committee to give it seems to me the federal district courts wider discretion as to the type, the latitude that they could choose in applying any sort of joinder application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.811" offset="6318582">Nevertheless, it's our contention, it's been our contention form the beginning that this amendment to Rule 23 although it does a way with the designations we call hybrid, spurious and true and those I remind this Court were creations I think of the writers rather than of the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.935" offset="6411160">Nevertheless, they have to be used today as some form of a guideline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.093" offset="6435715">Mr. Justice White asked my opponent as to what procedure might be evolved in the event that various of the parties within a class should seek to remove themselves from that class and clearly as we pointed our in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.265" offset="6508440">The possibility is that the final remaining or remaining parties would not have the jurisdictional limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.846" offset="6546787">I think that the intention of the federal rules was not to determine whether or not the party litigant could get into court but rather what procedure might be used to simplify the approach that the court could take to the handling of the various litigation before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.518" offset="6621393">The jurisdictional limits that are imposed upon the courts must be viewed first and in this instance, it's a $10,000.00 limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.360" offset="6656815">The plaintiff in this case by the admission of counsel has only approximately an $8,000.00 claim and that only by aggregation could she have as a forum the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.874" offset="6718882">She is not without of form, the Missouri Rules of Civil Procedure as set out in our brief provide the same or comparable provisions as did Rule 23 prior to its amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.204" offset="6776142">It would be my understanding that the simple result of the amendment to the rule was to promulgate a more practical working of the class procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.923" offset="6835075">It enabled the court to determine whether or not a matter if filled within the class action procedures and would be appropriate to that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.327" offset="6880632">But prior to making that determination, it seems to me that this court or any court has to determine whether or not the jurisdictional requirements are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.957" offset="6919189">Counsel has suggested that we might be talking about a limiting factor by invoking Rule 82.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.512" offset="6945416">Federal Rule 82 says and I quote in part “That the jurisdiction shall not be extended or limited.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.516" offset="6977390">I am not suggesting to this Court that we're talking about any limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.297" offset="6996511">The limitation is in existence by the present statutory enactment being the $10,000.00 limitation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2359.200" offset="9540211">I would like to speak to one additional point, that's this that one of the matters that's been beleaguered here has been this feeling sorry for this people who do not have the jurisdictional requirement to get in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.541" offset="9593501">But not withstanding that, we have every day and the courts of this land, cases where plaintiffs and petitioners have 9,800 or $9,999.00 and they are unable to avail these themselves of this forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.172" offset="9656090">If this is the excuse that's going to be used to allow them to arrive within the forum of the federal court, then of course new learning is going to have to be established here and it is our position and our argument that the entire aggregation doctrine which has been derived and from the many cases that have come before this in the other federal courts, will have to be waived away and I don't believe that ipso facto, we're going to take wand in a race, all of these procedures and again, I go back to my initial claim which is this that it's our contention that the jurisdictional requirements have to be met and then we look to the federal rules of civil procedure to determine what manner of action may be brought here and if a class action properly lies because I have the $10,000.01 then so be it, I'm in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.606" offset="9881788">Otherwise, I am limited to a perfectly adequate forum which provides the same sort of determination as the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.857" offset="9922748">I'm not led to believe that the state courts of Missouri are going to be arbitrary in reaching a decision here anymore than I would be at the federal courts and I feel that an adequate result if the law so supports, it can be achieved by the petitioner in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.172" offset="10008012">Again, I allude to the fact that based upon my interpretation, the interpretation of Judge Harper in our District Court and a reading of the Advisory Committee indicates that this a procedural working and that under the doctrine established in the Pinel case, under the doctrine established in the Troy Bank versus Whitehead case and under all of the cases that we've cited in our brief that the aggregation doctrine is not to be wiped away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.000" offset="10143326">It's a procedural -- it's a doctrine that determines that is determinative of the jurisdictional requisites needed to get into this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.325" offset="10208632">I would call Mr. Chief Justice Warren's attention to a paragraph that we've referred to in our brief which points out among other things that the increase in 1958 of the jurisdictional amount to $10,000.00 seemingly has only had a slight effect on the workload of the jurist -- of the judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.630" offset="10313853">If this effort on the part of petitioner to invoke Federal Rule 23 (b) is allowed to be utilized under the situation that they claim, then I can see that this Court will be flooded with just extensive litigation because all of those claimants who have one cent that when they get together and get $10,000.01 together under a separate and distinct claim procedure will have the forum of this Court available to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.785" offset="10462542">This petitioner represent -- recognized the separate and distinct nature of its claim throughout and we merely urge upon this Court that the decisions of the Fifth Circuit which this Court -- which applied for certiorari to this Court and which is subsequently denied the decision of the Eight Circuit and of by the way some of the federal districts of Illinois are very well reasoned and have arrived at a proper result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.923" offset="10583019">I would call the Court's attention to one other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.747" offset="10594408">There are two cases in Illinois which go in opposite routes and it would be our position that the Booth versus General Dynamics case which seems to permit an aggregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.869" offset="10642892">Actually, was viewed in the Lesh case also cited in our brief and recognized by the Lesh case as reaching an improper result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.397" offset="10685001">I would also like to call this Court's attention to the Gas Service Company case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.002" offset="10703391">The Tenth Circuit in reaching its result, it was at least was our determination in relying on the Gibbs versus Buck case has misconstrued the decision of that case but that in fact in that case an examination shows that all of the parties that were petitioners to that case have the requisite jurisdictional amount so that there was no question here as to whether aggregation was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.349" offset="10820733">And it seems to me that the Buck case, Gibbs versus Buck case reiterates and reaffirms the earlier and later decisions of this Court that the aggregation doctrine is a well thought up and a well situated doctrine that should not be wiped away and I would suggest to this Court that if the Court feels that amended Rule 23 (b) permits this than what the Court is doing is in one fell's hoop is wiping out the aggregation doctrine which seems to us to be a very realistic doctrine that has been established for over a hundred years in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.602" offset="10973811">Thank you very much.</text>

            <text syncTime="3264.837" offset="13162768">Mr. Justice, I might say that the -- there isn't action in the state court, a corporate -- traditional corporate derivative action which we do not participate in and that our position is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.688" offset="13218147">Our action is brought on behalf of the stockholders, not on behalf of the corporation for the reason is that if this $1,200,000.00 will be covered and would be paid in to the corporation that it would be the wrongdoers who now control, who would be getting the benefit of this premium that was paid to them and there are cases to substantiate our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.695" offset="13302157">So therefore, we are asking that the million and our complaint specifically states that we are asking judgment for a $1,200,000.00 for the members of the class, that is the judgment prayed for.</text>
