            <label>Mr. Thomas J. Downey</label>
            <text syncTime="30.804" offset="226617">May it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.420" offset="253053">This is an appeal from the judgment and decree of the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri, which found that the 1967 Missouri Congressional Redistricting Act did not meet the requirements of Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.309" offset="336645">Two members of the court concurred in the majority opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.937" offset="355140">One member of the court dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.457" offset="373217">The Act in question was drafted and became law by the Missouri legislature in 1967 following the invalidation of a prior Congressional Redistricting Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.483" offset="449285">The Missouri Legislature has called a general assembly meets according to the Missouri Constitution for a period of six months every two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.392" offset="500903">It convenes in January and its term expires the last day of June.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.987" offset="535280">The legislature began considering congressional redistricting in 1967 early in the legislative session, and during the six-month period more than 16 different proposed bills were considered by the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.350" offset="604766">And in the final week of the legislative session, the 1967 Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.279" offset="640502">It takes a constitutional majority in each House of the Missouri legislature for any law to be passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.041" offset="675506">There are 163 members of the lower house and it takes 82 votes to pass a bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.133" offset="707897">There are 34 members in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.491" offset="717302">It takes 18 votes to pass a bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.887" offset="734960">The political complexion of the General Assembly in 1967 was 107 Democrats in the lower house and 56 Republicans.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.029" offset="775502">In the upper house, it was 23 Democrats and 11 Republicans.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.818" offset="794624">The Act which we have under consideration before the Court here today when it was before the lower house, received a negative vote of all 56 Republicans.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.238" offset="844361">The Act on original consideration in the Senate received a negative of all 11 Republicans.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.922" offset="875081">On final enactment in the Senate, it received the votes of 10 Republicans, one being a negative vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.402" offset="908936">Now I point this out to the Court because although the Republican Party did not consider this Act to be favorable to the Republican Party as far as a congressional redistricting plan was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.942" offset="971107">The leaders of the Republican Party, the House leader and the Senate leader both testified before the lower court that they considered this Act to be a reasonable legislative compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.997" offset="1023352">And that had they been in control of the legislature that in all likelihood, the political complexion of the districts would have been different.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.710" offset="1066193">But the numerical disparities in the districts would probably have been approximately the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.245" offset="1092315">That is the only significance in bringing out this particular factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.551" offset="1109556">Now what was the Act that was enacted?</text>
            <text syncTime="254.633" offset="1121886">Missouri according to the 1960 census passed a population or had a population of approximately 4,320,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.735" offset="1170265">Missouri was entitled to 10 congressmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.966" offset="1187192">Therefore, each congressional district if you had an ideal mathematical district in the state would have a population of approximately 431,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.678" offset="1246124">The Act that was passed, there was a population disparity between the largest of the 10 districts and the smallest of the 10 districts of slightly in excess of 25,000 population based upon the 1960 census.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.062" offset="1327626">Now, what does this mean in terms of relative strength in population or relative affect on voting rights?</text>
            <text syncTime="320.319" offset="1384678">The largest district in percentage terms was approximately 3% larger than what an ideal district should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.368" offset="1420831">The smallest district was slightly less than 3% below what an ideal district should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.065" offset="1451656">The ratio of the largest district to the smallest district was 1.06.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.626" offset="1481853">Now that is the factual situation with which we are dealing here this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.045" offset="1511528">It is appellant's contentions that this congressional redistricting plan and the population variations reflected by this congressional redistricting plan are per se constitutional and meet the requirements of Article I, Section 2 that the House of Representatives shall be chosen by the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.997" offset="1615391">This Court has recognized that --</text>

            <text syncTime="449.563" offset="1901589">Where is the point where this much population variation is okay, and this much is all wrong? As stated by one court a number of years ago, it's easy to tell the difference between noon and midnight.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.294" offset="1964596">But it is very difficult to tell the difference between dusk and darkness.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.955" offset="1983195">And I think we have a situation here which on the face of it is in that realm between dusk and darkness.</text>

            <text syncTime="2569.798" offset="10382608">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.368" offset="10392848">The disparity between the population of the Eighth District and ideal is not 25,000, it's 13,542.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.726" offset="10438301">So the difference, I don't think this 25,000 figure should be misunderstood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.066" offset="10467662">The Eighth District is overpopulated by only 13,542 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.560" offset="10497651">And as the statistics in the Attorney General's brief comparing the voters in proportion to the population show the fact that Fort Leonard Wood with approximately 40,000 soldiers and the University of Missouri with approximately 17,000 people at Columbia, about 5,000 at Rolla plus the political workers at Jefferson City most of whom vote back home in their home counties would more than offset that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.030" offset="10623457">So that if an appropriate adjustment were made for the transient population in the Eighth District, actually the Eighth District in terms of voters is under populated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.371" offset="10680822">Now in the Nebraska case, Eighth Circuit Judge Johnson made a very interesting and I think pertinent comment about analyzing population figures in reapportionment cases to demonstrate the extent to which votes are diluted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.806" offset="10778624">And he pointed out that if you add up the actual population of the overpopulated districts and compare that to what the population should be, if each of those districts were ideal, you get the difference between those figures is the number of people that those five districts have in the aggregate that they should not have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.801" offset="10878621">Now in Missouri, we have five overpopulated and five under populated districts, if you add up the population of the five overpopulated districts, you get 2,194,000 some odd people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.150" offset="10935986">If all five of those districts were pertinent, you would have 2,159,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.644" offset="10969945">So that what you really have is 34,680 too many people in a total of five districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.483" offset="11009337">Then as Judge Johnson pointed out, one congressman is supposed to represent ideally 431,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.402" offset="11048939">So if one congressman equals 431,000 people, the 34,000 excess in the five districts equals 8% of one congressman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.809" offset="11102647">So that you have in the aggregate in these five districts all the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.169" offset="11124067">All the people in the five districts put together have been cheated out of 8% of one congressman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.229" offset="11156250">And it follows of course that in any one district their vote -- the people of the district as a whole, their vote has been diluted by 1/5 of 8% of one congressman.</text>

            <text syncTime="4153.691" offset="16718137">I will give the Court my reason for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4157.423" offset="16733080">Missouri beyond almost every state has 114 counties, and the City of St. Louis which by statute is in effect a county, in other words, 115 counties to be divided between ten congressional districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4175.249" offset="16804342">We have the two masses of population density on the west of the state in Kansas City, the Fifth district and on the east of the state in St. Louis in St. Louis County the first, second and third districts.</text>

            <text syncTime="4196.027" offset="16887515">In fact in each case, there are portions of the county left to go into rural districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4201.635" offset="16909876">We have remaining six congressional districts to be divided among 115 counties or mathematically, we have an average of 19 county building blocks within which to structure a congressional district.</text>
            <text syncTime="4221.236" offset="16988348">Well, obviously the more building blocks you have and the smaller the building blocks, the easier it is without crossing county lines to create congressional districts of great exactitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="4234.882" offset="17042892">Now beyond that in Missouri, the fact is that there are 38 counties of the state or almost exactly 1/3 which have less than 10,000 population, which means that there is a great flexibility of shifting of all counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4253.474" offset="17117288">In fact, with regard to the variances in this case, the variants in the Eighth District of excess of over 13,000 population, that figure of 13,000 population is more than the population of half of the counties of Missouri of each of the lines counties of Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="4277.854" offset="17214777">If you take the total variance of all about 26,000 -- almost 26,000 that variance is more than the population of any of 95 of the 115 counties of Missouri.</text>

            <text syncTime="5137.355" offset="20652805">You may want to answer it after lunch, it works to be all right for me.</text>
            <text syncTime="5143.367" offset="20676838">Your argument seems to me in one respect in a way depends upon burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="5150.851" offset="20706826">And your brief I guess that the burden of proof to burden of justifying deviations from the ideal is on the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="5165.553" offset="20765550">Now I wonder if it is impossible that the question of burden of proof may be a little more complex than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5173.589" offset="20797733">And where you have what appears to be a gross for non-permissible variation, whatever figure you may target figure one may have in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="5186.143" offset="20847992">If I have 10% in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="5188.548" offset="20857605">Whatever target figure in the particular circumstances one may have in mind, where there is a mathematically large or a gross deviation from the one man, one vote mathematics.</text>
            <text syncTime="5206.022" offset="20927509">But then the burden is on the state to justify it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5209.705" offset="20942242">But may it not be that where and perhaps this is such a case, and this perhaps this is such a case that where the variation is relatively modest that the burden may then be on those attacking the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="5232.564" offset="21033671">That is to say that you're trying now to bear that burden in one respect by saying that the state could do better and could come to a closer approximation of the mathematically ideal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5251.202" offset="21108172">So my brother have asked you whether you have other complaints about the plans, such as political gerrymandering or other attempts to keep incumbents in office or whatever it may be?</text>
            <text syncTime="5268.411" offset="21177031">And as I understand it, your answer to that has been no.</text>

            <text syncTime="5363.132" offset="21555911">To continue with my answer to Mr. Justice Fortas's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5369.238" offset="21580361">It's our position that the appellant, the attorneys representing the state did not meet the burden of proof and we think, well quite specifically the lower court so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="5383.207" offset="21636159">And in both the statement, the opinion of Judge Oliver and Judge Collinson, they both indicated that the burden of proof had not been met by the proponents of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="5393.965" offset="21679208">But of course we recognize that this Court must examine that and we will continue to argue that they have not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5402.473" offset="21713272">Then I would like to continue somewhat from the map one additional piece of evidence of the 10 congressional districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5412.003" offset="21751411">One might say quite clearly that the first three in St. Louis and St. Louis County which are exclusively urban and suburban, and five which is Kansas City, Jackson County but exclusively Kansas City.</text>
            <text syncTime="5428.070" offset="21815672">Three of those four are well over populated which means of course if they are well under represented, three out four.</text>
            <text syncTime="5436.373" offset="21848900">Now, the Eighth District has been characterized in the appellant's brief as in the group of predominantly rural.</text>
            <text syncTime="5446.475" offset="21889233">But the fact is of course that it has major cities and it extends well into the urban area of St. Louis County.</text>
            <text syncTime="5455.724" offset="21926222">So that we may in effect consider it as a mixture and for the purposes of my argument, I would ignore it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5462.368" offset="21952867">This leads five predominantly rural congressional districts, and four of those five are under populated and therefore over represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="5474.311" offset="22000619">So we have a classic Reynolds versus Sims situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5477.704" offset="22014203">We have the rural areas strongly favored three out of four over represented against the urban areas under represented three out of four.</text>
            <text syncTime="5491.485" offset="22069269">I would like to speak to the question raised both in the briefs and the arguments as to the percentage comparisons with the Florida case, Gong versus Kirk and the Mississippi case, Connors versus Johnson.</text>
            <text syncTime="5507.071" offset="22131649">First of all the Court will recall that in both of those cases, this Court affirmed the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5514.266" offset="22160488">There was not the situation which we have in the instant case where this Court is being asked to review the weight of the evidence and reverse the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5522.515" offset="22193403">Second of all and although I realize there is dispute between the appellants and the appellees and between the majority decision of the court below and the dissenting opinion, as to what the issue was before this Court in Connors versus Johnson.</text>
            <text syncTime="5538.145" offset="22255992">We still hold to our position that the only issue raised there was the issue of racial gerrymander.</text>
            <text syncTime="5544.221" offset="22280234">And so this question of as equal as practicable by population really was not presented to the court and therefore the court did not fully consider and weigh the question of percentage variances.</text>
            <text syncTime="5557.298" offset="22332583">But more than that, I think we must go to the concepts behind structuring of districts to see why comparisons between states are little and perhaps no value.</text>
            <text syncTime="5573.207" offset="22396217">There are various factors, the total population of the state the population distribution in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="5580.162" offset="22424012">Are there dense urban areas?</text>
            <text syncTime="5582.368" offset="22432893">How many dense urban areas?</text>
            <text syncTime="5583.883" offset="22438954">How are they in relation to rural areas?</text>
            <text syncTime="5587.147" offset="22451911">The number of counties, large or small the size of the counties, are they easily movable?</text>
            <text syncTime="5592.940" offset="22475107">The location of the counties as in the particular plan, are they so located that they may be shifted from one district to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="5600.216" offset="22504260">In other words, the total geographic relationship of thence large counties to the rural sparsely populated counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5610.354" offset="22544802">Now in considering these factors as I illustrated before, Missouri is an ideal situation where if the extreme of having, or two dense populated areas in two corners of the state and in the interim after the state, we have these 115 counties to be divided roughly 20 to a congressional district.</text>
            <text syncTime="5634.519" offset="22641455">Now how does this relate?</text>
            <text syncTime="5636.154" offset="22648038">Just for illustration, and I do not cite these examples to argue the comparisons specifically but two examples which illustrate why the problem could well be different in other states?</text>
            <text syncTime="5646.870" offset="22690879">Let us take first New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="5648.854" offset="22698820">New York with 17 million population as opposed to Missouri's four million.</text>
            <text syncTime="5656.113" offset="22727868">With 41 congressional districts has only 62 counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5661.390" offset="22748975">This means as a matter of actual fact in the maps before this Court in the case to follow that the congressional districts in no case had more than four or five counties to a district.</text>
            <text syncTime="5675.860" offset="22806862">So your building blocks were large, and the flexibility was very limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="5680.454" offset="22825148">So you might well argue that the percentage is significant in that state but have no significance when you discuss Missouri situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5687.696" offset="22854196">The same thing to a different extent is true in Gong versus Kirk in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="5693.945" offset="22879169">Florida has 12 congressional districts, but instead of Missouri has a 115 counties, it has 67.</text>
            <text syncTime="5701.361" offset="22908844">And the distribution there was such that in six districts, only three counties were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5707.153" offset="22931937">One district four counties, in four districts it rose to nine or ten, and in only one district did it rise to the level of the flexibility of Missouri which has in that case they consolidated 23 counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5722.888" offset="22994944">So it seems to me that we come back to the fact that percentages simply are not meaningful.</text>
            <text syncTime="5730.190" offset="23024097">The test should be a good faith effort to be the best that can be done. And we submit that in Missouri, the legislature failed by a long shot.</text>

            <text syncTime="5918.859" offset="23778826">They speak of the state university in the eighth, but in the fourth the adjoining district at the opposite end of the scale, there is Central Missouri State College, a state college.</text>
            <text syncTime="5935.417" offset="23845073">There are the schools in Kansas City.</text>
            <text syncTime="5938.223" offset="23856253">There are as throughout the State of Missouri numerous sectarian colleges.</text>
            <text syncTime="5943.799" offset="23878614">On the question of the military establishment of Fort Leonard Wood, in the fourth district again at the opposite end of the scale, there is Richard Scabauer, an army base.</text>
            <text syncTime="5954.355" offset="23920828">There's Whiteman Air base, and again throughout the state, I presume if there were table, we would find that there are these situations in various districts of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="5966.234" offset="23968266">Certainly in each of the rural districts, there is a state college.</text>

            <text syncTime="6216.878" offset="24970846">The appellants talk about a flood of cases coming before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6221.567" offset="24989654">It seems to me that if the flood must come, it must flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="6228.621" offset="25017866">However, it is certainly debatable what causes the flood.</text>
            <text syncTime="6232.960" offset="25035212">We think it may well be that creating a safety zone, a haven of refuge by establishing a de minimis or a reasonable figure will establish a zone within which the legislature based upon their past history, will then seek to gain their partisan political considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6254.585" offset="25121729">As result of which perhaps more cases will come before this Court, and we think that the Court would do well to stand to its present standards which is simply that of approaching practicable equality by population.</text>
            <text syncTime="6271.968" offset="25191215">I'd like to summarize by quoting from Reinhold Niebuhr who said “The vision of a just society is an impossible one which can be approximated only by those who do not regard it as impossible.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6284.885" offset="25242937">Perhaps mathematical equality may be impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="6288.960" offset="25259238">But equality of a voter's rights will only be achieved when those charged with the task seek equality and do not view it as impossible.</text>
