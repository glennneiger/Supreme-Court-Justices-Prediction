            <label>Mr. Nathan Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="52.847" offset="314807">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.773" offset="330480">My name is Nathan Greenberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.460" offset="337168">I’m an attorney from Gretna, Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.473" offset="349288">I represent the defendant in this case, Philip Cardinale, Jr. who was the petitioner in this Honorable Court for a petition for a writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.863" offset="398817">The petitioner was convicted of the crime of murder in Plaquemine Parish, Louisiana and he was sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.079" offset="443643">For his appeal, we originally perfected some-14 Bills of exceptions which we took to the Supreme Court of Louisiana and we are here before Your Honors today on what would probably amount to two of the Bills of exceptions which have been combined together in one</text>
            <text syncTime="106.442" offset="529115">The Crux of the issue before Your Honors today is the effect of testimony relative to prior offenses of the accused where the accused has not taken a stand in his behalf and where, actually, we submit that the use of the prior convictions in this case was to show nothing more than a disposition to commit crime which, we submit, would violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.152" offset="671953">Now, the way this developed in this matter was like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.479" offset="693269">The accused turned himself in, in Tucson, Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.366" offset="712808">And, while he was in custody, he was interrogated by the police there.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.647" offset="737991">Now, this was pre-Miranda and subsequent Escobedo.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.956" offset="755231">So, the Escobedo rule applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.072" offset="771636">During the course of his custodial interrogation, the petitioner volunteered that he had previously been convicted of an offense in Louisiana, which offense was actually a crime against nature, that after he served his time in New Orleans Parish Prison, that he went looking for the girl who had charged him with this crime, according to him, allegedly with a gun for the purpose of killing her.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.423" offset="929102">Now, he did not find the girl.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.900" offset="938924">He did not commit any offense in connection with it, and his statements relative to the prior offense or, generally, that let’s see-- I’ll see if I can read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.886" offset="1014888">During the course of his custodial interrogation in Tucson, Arizona, he referred to a prior conviction occurring in Louisiana, which, prior conviction was for a crime against nature occurring on July 12, 1963 and causing the petitioner to be sentenced to serve three months in a parish prison on March 25, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.931" offset="1099107">Petitioner further stated, during the course of his custodial interrogation, that after he served his time in New Orleans Parish Prison, he went looking for his alleged prosecutrix with a gun for the stated purpose of killing her.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.453" offset="1153233">However, he never did find her and, therefore, no further offense was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.070" offset="1171623">Now, in essence, what we have here is a situation where this reference to the prior offense serves absolutely no useful purpose, we respectfully submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.269" offset="1216449">The only purpose that this link could possibly serve, we submit, is to try to prejudice the jury to show the jury that this defendant is a bad man.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.862" offset="1254797">This, of course, is why we’re here before Your Honors today because, here, we had a situation where this could very easily have been separated from the remainder of the statements of the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.452" offset="1325223">This could very easily have been excluded, notwithstanding the fact that we sought to exclude it from the time it first came up.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.305" offset="1364616">It came up in the opening statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.458" offset="1373184">It came up in the interrogation of the police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.433" offset="1385096">It came up in the closing argument by the District Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.319" offset="1400665">Notwithstanding the fact that we sought to exclude at each level of the proceedings or each stages of proceeding, it was admitted and it was repeatedly referred to in the closing argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="351.905" offset="1511006">This was prior to the ruling of Your Honors in the Spencer case and, of course, we’ve picked up the language of the Spencer case which, I believe, was in 1967 as a basis of relying upon the application for the writ to this Court and the wording of the dissenting opinion by Mr. Chief Justice Warren.</text>

            <text syncTime="392.743" offset="1674324">In the Trial Court, what had happened was that the states ought to justify the admissibility of the conviction on a basis of propensity or pattern and, of course, we argued to the Court at this time that there was no pattern because the prior offense was crime against nature and this, of course, was murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.117" offset="1767842">And, of course, the only reference to the alleged looking for the prosecutrix with a gun and so forth related to an incomplete offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.882" offset="1798875">Now, we did not succeed in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.186" offset="1812146">The state then came in and sought to justify the admissibility of the testimony on a theory that this was a part of the entire confession, and the entire confession as a whole must go in, that Louisiana has such a statute requiring this that the entire confession go in.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.585" offset="1885706">And, since this defendant said this, regardless of what it was, it must go into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.635" offset="1913919">And, of course, we respectfully submit that this should not be so.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.259" offset="1932413">For example, suppose the defendant made a statement reflecting upon character or integrity of jurors, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.256" offset="1964387">Should this go in because it’s a part of an alleged confession?</text>
            <text syncTime="469.201" offset="1980165">Should the prosecution be entitled to use this as an attempt to prejudice the jury against the defendant?</text>
            <text syncTime="478.117" offset="2015796">We respectfully submit that the issue in this case is quite simple and the issue is to what extent the evidence of prior convictions should be allowed to go in on behalf of the prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="2033.619" offset="8237850">Well, not knowing to him, he had just crossed the line and had murdered the girl in Plaquemine Parish.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.765" offset="8266480">So, the police in Tucson didn’t’ really had the opportunity to either check his stories and see why he was wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.272" offset="8292498">Now, in Tucson, talking to these policemen, in which, our State Court, and the Trial Court also, said it was a very relaxed conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.690" offset="8334085">He was a man who wanted to get something off of his chest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.558" offset="8345579">He’s a man who flagged the policeman down, the man who wanted to talk about something that had occurred, to talk to the policeman who knew nothing about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.415" offset="8381001">And, our Court and the State Supreme Court ruled, of course, the Johnson case was applicable where they said even in the-- over and above the Johnson case, they felt this confession met that comment in the Miranda case, that you don’t have to stop a man when he walks to the police and flags you down and wants to get something off of his chest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.154" offset="8467937">So, in this writ, there’s no issue raised whatsoever as to the voluntary nature of this confession and this confession meets all the tests of being voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.580" offset="8517674">The only issue arises are the following testimony in which this police officer from Tucson gave the defendant’s confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.323" offset="8560619">Included in that confession, was this comment and I’ll read it for the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3080.936" offset="12427160">We also take the position that even under the minority decision in the Spencer case, that this evidence which we introduced meets the test that this Court was talking about in all of its decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3119.236" offset="12580342">In furtherance of carrying out our responsibility to prove intent as a necessary ingredient of the crime of murder, this evidence was inadmissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.649" offset="12626004">I’ve cited several state cases directly on point in which they deal with the question that when intent is a necessary ingredient of the crime charged, it’s something which goes to the determination of the issue directly before the jury with respect to intent, that it is admissible in a long list of cases in our jurisprudence, and those cases have also been recognized by this Court that they are exceptions to that general rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.881" offset="12738853">We say we fall under it, number one, because it’s our statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.112" offset="12755780">It would not be within the providence of this Court to rewrite that statute under Spencer.</text>

            <text syncTime="3200.293" offset="12904573">He’s come across the river, the same area of town, picks up a girl in the same area, has drinks with her, commits certain acts, one winds up where she complains, he gets a gun and goes out with intent to kill her because she complained of his conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="3512.621" offset="14153853">I merely would like to call two matters to the Court’s attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.960" offset="14183215">At page 4 and 5 of the appendix, we set forth the chronology of events and, in the bottom of page 4, it indicates that the case was concluded Friday, May 6, that the defendant -- of 1966, the defendant was sentenced to death on July 19, 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.719" offset="14278196">And, on October 6, 1966, the per curiam on the Bill of Exceptions were signed by the Trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.827" offset="14310693">Now, under Louisiana law, the rule which was in existence at that time was that, upon signing of the Bill of Exceptions, a Trial Court is divested of jurisdiction and any Bills filed thereafter and presented to the judge for his signature in per curiam come too late and cannot be considered on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.500" offset="14389373">And, this is the decision of State versus Harrell, 228 Louisiana 434, 82 Southern 2nd 701.</text>

            <text syncTime="3586.643" offset="14449977">Now, the law has since been changed in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.095" offset="14459800">We now have a new Code of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.596" offset="14469726">However, this case was tried prior to the effective date of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.865" offset="14490833">Spencer versus the State of Texas, which focused attention on the issue raised herein, was decided -- or it was rather argued on October 17 and 8, 1966 and was decided January 23, 1967 which, of course, was subsequent to the taking of the appeal, the filing of the Bills of Exceptions, and the rendition of the per curiam by the Trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.243" offset="14588322">And, we also wish to call Your Honors’ attention to the decision of O’Conner versus Ohio decided by Your Honors in 1966, 87 Supreme Court 252, 385 US 92, in which case Your Honors actually took jurisdiction of a matter which have not been raised in the Trial Court and held that, since the defendant was not in the position to literally foresee the action which Your Honors were going to take in this particular case --</text>
