            <text syncTime="49.540" offset="301537">I'd like to also for the record indicate that I was assisted and I truly appreciate the help from the Solicitor of this Court, John Knotty, III of Rhode Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.198" offset="356185">The petitioner if it please the Court is under sentence at the present time to a term of two years, an institution to be decided by the United States Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.917" offset="431000">He was charged, tried and convicted first in the District of Rhode Island in the federal district court for a willful failure and a knowing failure to report for induction at the military forces of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.129" offset="507904">The trouble of the case I feel is accurately cited in the brief for petitioner and I submit to the court that perhaps the crowning issue in this case is whether or not the defendant in that case and the appellant here did in fact have noticed of the draft notice itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.323" offset="616678">The record I feel is replete of testimony that would clearly indicate that the petitioner in this case, Philip Jerome Stiles did not in fact receive a notice that was sent to him by the draft board from Westerly, Rhode Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.492" offset="689298">The first contact of the petitioner had with the Selective Service System of the United States occurred on the 18th day of April 1963 wherein he filled down his application pursuant to the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.274" offset="756485">I indicate to Chief Justice and Your Honorable Justices of this Court that his first communication with them subsequent thereto was on 05/17/1963 wherein the petitioner's case advised his local selective service draft board that he would in fact be in the State of Tennessee and the transcript will indicate that this was received by the local draft board on the 20th day of May 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.381" offset="884903">The matter of notice relative to a receipt of draft notices has in fact been discussed on the case of Bartchy versus the United States and I submit that this is a very important case.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.318" offset="956688">The case does indicate that the defendant does have a duty to promptly advice his draft board of his address but the case indicates that he is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.619" offset="1005798">In fact the client remained in one place provided even he is in fact anticipating the arrival of a draft notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.533" offset="1045504">I submit that the petitioner in this case did not in fact anticipate a draft notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.416" offset="1089076">I must admit and I do admit that the petition in this case directed communications to the local draft board that contained a language that was less than desirable from the point of view of the recipient.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.095" offset="1151770">However, the defendant did in fact and the appellant in this case did in fact notified his draft board that he would in fact not be at the address that was listed on his papers in the custody of the draft board and subsequent thereto he was sent an induction notice but the draft board.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.243" offset="1268381">He notified them by letter on January 17, 1966 and he advised the draft board that he would be away.</text>

            <text syncTime="323.146" offset="1395963">The notice was sent on the 17th day of January 1966 and the draft board properly, promptly rather on January 24, 1966 sent an induction notice to him ordering him to in fact report for induction on the 9th day of February 1966.</text>

            <text syncTime="1450.965" offset="5907205">Then there was an argument about the authority of the clerk of the draft board to issue the notice and I don't think that is an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.405" offset="5949001">It seems to me that there are two principal places where there are problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.542" offset="5981497">The first arises out of the form of the statute which makes it a crime if a person knowingly fails or neglects to or refuses to perform any duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.620" offset="6053804">And the question of the effect of knowingly, I would point out that the indictment goes even further, the indictment says, willfully and knowingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.790" offset="6098526">The statute only requires knowingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.996" offset="6107408">I don't know whether there's any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.879" offset="6118902">I think it is arguable that knowingly and that statute doesn't quite mean perception within the mind but means what we use to call mens rea that he -- the circumstances were such that he knew he was doing wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.413" offset="6217017">Now with respect to that, it is probably clear that he did not in fact himself received or know about the notice to report for induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.412" offset="6281070">And so we do have a case in which the Government has to maintain that he knowingly fail to report for induction although he did not have actual knowledge of the notice to report for induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.679" offset="6342092">There's a long history in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.408" offset="6357034">Going back to 1963 when the defendant filed a printed form in which he filled out his name with the draft board in which he declared his disaffiliation from the draft system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.221" offset="6436237">He was however at that time a student and the board continued his II-S student deferment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.797" offset="6474585">In the fall of 1965, he ceased to be a student.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.086" offset="6495692">The board sent him on November 29, 1965 and ordered to report for a physical examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.949" offset="6535189">He ignored that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.893" offset="6538951">He did not report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.646" offset="6553997">The board, it seems to me used certain amount of calm at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.379" offset="6584926">On December 21, 1965 they sent him a second order to report for a physical examination on January 6, 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.050" offset="6635604">And the record is clear that he received both of these notices and that he failed to report on January 6, 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.581" offset="6681684">On January 11th, five days later, he was declared delinquent under the regulations of the Selective Service System.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.700" offset="6726196">A delinquency notice was sent to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.926" offset="6739048">And the record is clear that he received that delinquency notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.608" offset="6761827">The particular notice which was sent to him was a somewhat old form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.909" offset="6778964">We have examined it in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.027" offset="6791502">It advised him that he was subject to criminal penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.459" offset="6809161">It did not advise him as the regulations plainly say that he would be subject to immediate induction, ahead of -- even of volunteers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.258" offset="6884394">On January 14th, he was ordered for a third time to report for a physical examination, this to be on January 20, 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.082" offset="6939669">And it was on January 17th that he sent to the local board the letter which appears on page 48 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.480" offset="6997243">And I think I'll read the whole letter, it's somewhat bizarre.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.909" offset="7023052">“Dear Sirs, your threatening letters continually arrive telling me exactly what to do and informing me of the penalties for not complying with your directives.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.852" offset="7062758">Now that shows that he was aware that he was in a somewhat serious situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.805" offset="7090552">“In response, I can only repeat my previous assertions that I am unwilling to be a part of the organized murder and threat of murder which is the basis of any army.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.253" offset="7128377">I may point out, however, he has never made a claim of conscientious objection at any time either in the records or in connection with the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.028" offset="7171532">There are better forms of communication and impersonal printed forms filled with orders and threats.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.764" offset="7198386">If the man is to function socially, it's something more than a self-destructive machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.877" offset="7218866">The improvement of communication is of great importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.302" offset="7232554">“If you wish to discuss these matters further perhaps we could arrange a mutually convenient time and place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.675" offset="7262124">I hope that you folks can write above crude attempts of manipulation and engage in some constructive interaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.483" offset="7289292">Love, Bill Stiles.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.237" offset="7304338">Then a postscript, “I am soon going to take a vacation trip of a month or two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.103" offset="7331819">I tell you this because my leaving town with no definitive forwarding address might otherwise seem evasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.909" offset="7367032">Don't worry, I'll send you postcards letting you know how I am getting along.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.464" offset="7393259">And the -- he then did leave town.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.794" offset="7410500">Apparently about January 20th, he -- the record contains some evidence that he was very much concerned about the reporting for the physical examination on January 20th that he came pretty close to doing it but that he finally pulled out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.268" offset="7508407">And it was on January 24th that the board sent him the notice to report for induction on February 9th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.978" offset="7547277">Mr. Rogers has said something about this being received at a different address to which it was sent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.472" offset="7577266">That is true but I think quite immaterial, the place where it was addressed was 10 Fulton Street, Westerly, Rhode Island and it was received at Post Office Box 10, Westerly, Rhode Island which is the place where the mail for 10 Fulton Street is delivered because the people who lived there have a post office box.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.016" offset="7671411">It was received by his mother and signed for by his mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.987" offset="7699310">The record is quite clear that the mother didn't open it and that the contents were not communicated to his son -- to her son, I may say too that this was his last known address and the record includes the regulation of the draft of the Selective Service System that the mailing of any order, notice or blank form by the local board to a registrant at the address last reported by him to the local board shall constitute notice to him of the contents of the communication whether he actually receives it or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.784" offset="7898467">He on February 11th sent a postcard from the -- to the draft board from Knoxville, Tennessee in which he said he was still thinking of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.743" offset="7970356">And then on February 15th, he mailed a postcard from Veracruz, Mexico which is on page 51-52 of the record and I would simply point out that the address he give -- he gave their in Spanish is simply general delivery, Veracruz, Mexico which is not a very permanent address.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.422" offset="8089057">He returned to Rhode Island about the middle of March.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.855" offset="8130748">I find it difficult to say that the record contains enough evidence so that the jury could've found that he actually knew of the notice to report for induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.465" offset="8189262">It does seem to me that it contains adequate evidence to support a determination by the jury that he was well aware that such a notice was very likely to come and that he took steps to obstruct the communication of the knowledge to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.366" offset="8272854">And in the Bartchy case to which Mr. Rogers has referred in 319 U.S. involving a seaman who did take steps to see that the draft notice came to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.301" offset="8348609">He gave the Houston address of his union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.551" offset="8365537">He informed the union that he would be in New York and told them to send it to the union office in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.856" offset="8394794">The Houston office did send it to the New York office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.476" offset="8413288">The New York office made a mistake and instead of delivering it to him, sent it back to Houston when he called from Maryland, New York, they said there was none.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.494" offset="8469400">In that case the trial court acquitted the defendant of failure to report for induction but convicted him of failure to keep the board informed as to his address.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.239" offset="8540348">This Court reversed the conviction on the latter point, concluding that he had taken appropriate steps and it was not his fault that it had not -- got to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.074" offset="8583711">In the course of the opinion however, the court said speaking through Mr. Justice Reed on page 489, “the regulation it seems to us is satisfied when the registrant in good faith provides a chain of forwarding addresses by which mails sent to the address which is furnished to the board may be by the registrant reasonably expected to come in to his hands in time for compliance.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.225" offset="8708263">And it's quite clear here that he did not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.964" offset="8747238">The District Court charged the jury that they had to find that he knowingly and willfully failed to report for induction and the jury found him guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.012" offset="8839398">It -- on the whole it seems to me that there is evidence to support that verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.003" offset="8871372">I think I am concerned about the consequence of a decision to the contrary because I can see the article in the selective service law reporter which will advise people that when you know that the draft notice is about to come, write to your board that you're about to take a vacation and you'll let them know and be sure that you see to it that whoever is at home to receive the mail doesn't it open and doesn't let you know anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.134" offset="9011911">And if that is a way to avoid the obligation to report for induction, it could be a fairly serious matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.015" offset="9059453">Now let me turn to the other aspect of the case which I think was the part that first gave me concern when I knew about the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.418" offset="9133014">Anyone who has been an educational administrator for a good part of his life has -- had contact with the situations like this, it's very hard to know just where to draw lines here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.299" offset="9220577">It was obvious this young man needed help and certainly Mr. Rogers has devoted a great deal of his time, energy and skill in providing that help.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.220" offset="9288286">I'm rather thinking of help at an earlier stage.</text>

            <text syncTime="2649.352" offset="10700779">Thank you, Mr. Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.216" offset="10708198">Very briefly if it please the Court, with reference to this motion to continue, I wish to make it crystal clear to this Court that there was absolutely no doubt in my mind that I was going to a trial immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.304" offset="10764622">And I would like the Court to notice that I was brave enough to have this put on the record if it please the Court and I'm certain that all being practitioners, we've been before a court and it doesn't very frankly take too much powers observations to know when you're going to trial and when you are not going to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.906" offset="10846960">Now, I indicate also for the record, the Solicitor General has in fact read these communications that I've brought to the attention of the Court and I indicate to the Court that now -- clearly, there's no doubt in my mind that my additional plea of not guilty by reason of insanity was clearly necessary under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.699" offset="10938180">I think that the record will indicate the accuracy of the plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.769" offset="10958451">I know that insanity, defensive insanity was applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.519" offset="10989484">The Solicitor General does in fact concede, it would appear to me that the young man had no notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.297" offset="11028564">He indicates that this young man failed to show for physical examinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.122" offset="11047894">I submit to the Court the he wasn't on trial for failing to report for physical examinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.146" offset="11071927">I concede that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.026" offset="11079450">He was charged with not reporting for induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.564" offset="11097631">Initially, the -- additionally the Solicitor General concedes that the notice that the then appellant -- defendant now upon it received was not one that contained notice of immediate induction into the Armed Forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.261" offset="11176417">I submit that it's very important to realize that all of this boy's conduct should in fact be taken into consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.036" offset="11219466">Did he or did he not comply with the requirements as laid out in the Bartchy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.526" offset="11245484">The -- to the best of my humble knowledge, there is no statute, there's no case law in existence in this country that will find someone guilty and sentence him and this young boy is under sentenced to two years in a federal prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.365" offset="11304835">And I submit that there's no statute or no case in existence in the United States that will charge, try and convict somebody and sentence them for an offense committed that they didn't know about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.691" offset="11358124">I submit that factually that the Solicitor General is incorrect when he says, “Whilst you have to do to avoid the draft is to send some ridiculous letter and I say ridiculous letter such as my client sent and leave town.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.096" offset="11419773">This is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.880" offset="11426879">It is necessary clearly to adhere to the requirements of the so-called Bartchy case.</text>
