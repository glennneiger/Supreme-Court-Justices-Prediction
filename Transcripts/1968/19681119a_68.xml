            <text syncTime="29.050" offset="219617">This is an appeal from an order of the three-judge Court in Chicago, dismissing a suit for declaratory judgment and injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.391" offset="252949">The suit was filed by two pre-trial detainees from Chicago, Cook County jail, on behalf of themselves and all of the persons similarly situated who are registered qualified voters but who are unable to get to the polls on election date because they are incarcerated, either without bail or because they lack the funds to post to monetary bail.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stanley A. Bass</label>
            <text syncTime="69.769" offset="382412">Correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.484" offset="389308">The suits sought a judgment declaring that the Illinois statutes applicable to absentee voting are unconstitutional and so far as they preclude the granting of absentee ballots to pre-trial detainees confined in the county of their residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.249" offset="456391">A timely notice of appeal was filed from the judgement of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.182" offset="476139">The jurisdictional statement was filed in February.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.308" offset="488573">In April, this Court grants a leave to proceed in 0139 and postponed the issue of jurisdiction until the hearing on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.741" offset="518353">So, I will turn first to the issue of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.177" offset="536116">Under Section 1253 of Title 28, appeals lie directly to the Supreme Court from an order denying an injunction and a civil action which is required to be heard by a three-judge Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.427" offset="589093">We therefore turn to Section 2281 of the judicial code which provides the three-judge district Court is required where an injunction is sought to restrain the enforcement, operation, or execution of a state statute by restraining the action of an officer of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.818" offset="666624">So there are three ingredients here.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.966" offset="675192">First, that injunction must be sought, that was true in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.848" offset="694732">Second, that there is a state statute or general state wide application.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.256" offset="712391">That's what we have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.344" offset="720750">Third, that we have a state officer or pursuant to the decisions of this Court, a local officer functioning pursuant to a state wide policy performing a state function.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.454" offset="769233">Now under Illinois law, as far as absentee ballots are concerned, the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners has the same responsibility as the county clerk in another county or anybody else who was charged with the duty of furnishing absentee ballots.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.209" offset="836211">Indeed, Section 19-2 of the election code which appears on page 15 of our brief states on the ninth line of the provision that the elector make application to the county clerk or were existing to the Board of Election Commissioners or other officer or officers charged with the duty of furnishing ballots for such election in his voting district.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.317" offset="952613">So that the fact that the Board of Election Commissioners here are the defendants is not relevant because their function is a state wide function, they perform the same function with respect to absentee ballots as the officers in the other counties and localities.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.542" offset="1025546">Nor is this case moot at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.088" offset="1035682">It is true that the two named representative plaintiffs are not in the Cook County jail awaiting trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.788" offset="1058565">Mr. Byrd was discharged a week after the election at his preliminary hearing and Mr. McDonald went to trial, it was a hang jury and he subsequently pleaded to a reduce charge of manslaughter which is a bailable offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.103" offset="1115826">However, since this is a class action and was found to be so by the trial court and I referred to page 30 of the record, where the three-judge Court says plaintiffs and the class they represent are.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.828" offset="1178728">The fact that this is a class action means that the fact that the named plaintiffs are not members of the class a more is not fatal as this Court indicated a month after the jurisdictional statement was filed to this case and the case was Lee versus Washington which involved the desegregation of the Alabama jails.</text>

            <text syncTime="324.818" offset="1402650">Well, Mr. Justice Marshall, the problem is that the class really cannot be seen very clearly until right before an election because it's very difficult to predict exactly who will be a pre-trial detainee on the day of election.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.849" offset="1470777">One could ascertain with some degree of certainty perhaps that we go to before the election exactly which persons, which named persons would be pre-trial detainees unable to get to the polls on election day and because this class is rather fluid, it's really impossible to identify any names except right before an election but I think the three-judge court below recognized that there surely must be a number of persons who are registered qualified voters in jail on the day of election.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.248" offset="1604315">Incidentally, the Cook County jail has about 1800 inmates, 2/3 of which awaiting trial, so that then there must be some number of person although they cannot be identified except right near an election.</text>

            <text syncTime="569.890" offset="2382973">Now, in this case, it's not very clear, it's not clear at all whether there are any legitimate state interests who are compelling to justify the denial of the right to vote to a person whose awaiting trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.391" offset="2440965">It would appear that the most that the election board could say would be that there's an administrative convenience in not having to dispense too many absentee ballots, but it seems to me that the mere fact that it's a few more absentee ballots to give out does not justify deprivation of such a fundamental right.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.624" offset="2537827">The board of election commission has taken the position in its brief that voting is a privilege or the voting by absentee ballot is a privilege rather than array.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.906" offset="2578996">And it seems to me that by calling something a privilege doesn't mean that the state can arbitrarily deny it to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.922" offset="2611075">Surely, if absentee ballots were dispensed on the basis of race, I don't think this Court would hesitate to say that that would be a denial of equal protection of the law, merely because absentee balloting may be considered a privilege by the state, and the District Court in Brown versus Post which we referred to in our reply brief held that where the Board of -- where the elections people went to the nursing home, the white nursing homes and not the black nursing homes that that was a denial of equal protection of the law and in giving out absentee ballots.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.110" offset="2747852">We submit that the mere fact that there is an absentee ballot rather than voting in person does not justify such a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.146" offset="2799992">Now, the Board of Election Commissioners raises the question, “need prisoners be afforded privileges when they can be denied liberty.”</text>
            <text syncTime="682.180" offset="2832071">I think this is perhaps the first case that this Court has had an opportunity to determine, whether there are any conditions or consequences of pretrial detention which may be considered constitutionally impermissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.694" offset="2886196">We must recognize that no matter how much bail reform occurs there is just going to be a number of people are going to be incarcerated prior to trial and it seems to me that we must address ourselves to the consequences of the pretrial detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.887" offset="2954951">I don't think it's a basic proposition one could say that the mere fact the man is detained prior to trial means you can do anything you want with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.474" offset="2985253">I think he's entitled to certain minimum standards of decency.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.999" offset="3007404">I think that if the state attempts to deny certain basic rights, they must show a compelling interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.455" offset="3033213">Now, what kind of compelling interest might be shown?</text>
            <text syncTime="735.259" offset="3044394">Perhaps institutions have certain rules regarding persons who visit.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.927" offset="3067068">Considerations of institutional security of course are parallel.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.103" offset="3079816">I think this Court in Lee versus Washington indicated that it's decision in no way suggested that the warden couldn't make allowances for institutional security.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.051" offset="3119626">But nowhere in the record of this case or in any case have I ever heard that inmate voting by absentee ballots or some -- have -- going to disrupt the routine of an institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.196" offset="3172185">There's nothing to suggest that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.831" offset="3182738">I think common sense would suggest that perhaps morale would be a lift when somebody votes from behind bars.</text>
