            <text syncTime="132.221" offset="632247">Well, I just don't know that certiorari would have been granted because, here, you have people arguing a very important issue on the basis not of a basic conflict of interest, but on the basis of a relatively small money judgment below.</text>

            <text syncTime="175.937" offset="807163">The difference in this case and in the previous case, of course, is that there was no restraining order issued in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.570" offset="833703">The effort to obtain the restraining order failed and, as a result, the plaintiff and his class were compelled to join the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, and they were compelled to pay dues to the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.280" offset="884485">And, when the appeal was pending in the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, those plaintiffs argued to that Court that they wanted the case remanded to the Trial Court for the purpose of having their dues money that they had paid to the Brotherhood restored to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.709" offset="942164">And that issue, of course, the issue of money damages, still makes this a live issue or a case of controversy for this Court because even if this Court does, pursuant to a mootness point, reverse and remand it and vacate the judgment, then these individual plaintiffs and the class that they represent will not be restored to the dues that they paid and would still have the claim for that money.</text>

            <text syncTime="442.223" offset="1872227">And they also held that the Court of Appeals opinion in the Third Circuit in Rohrer versus the Black Lick Railroad was inapplicable because that railroad was owned by a Steel company and was organized on an industrial basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.175" offset="1932100">And, with those positions and with that reasoning of the Court below, of course, we disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.041" offset="1963551">The legislative history of this law shows clearly that Congress intended the railway Unions to have a Union shop agreement just like the industrial Unions had.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.631" offset="2017886">The one problem that kept coming out and being debated was what they were going to do with the operating Unions as distinguished from the non-operating Unions because, in the operating crafts, there was this craft progression from fireman to engineer and back again to fireman, and between conductor and break man and back again to break man, and that argument was debated in Congress at some length, and different proposals where made at various stages of legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.877" offset="2138885">At one time, the proposal was made that perhaps the parties could just negotiate it out, and that wasn't satisfactory.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.653" offset="2170023">Another time, a proposal was made similar to what we did here that the man would have to be a member of the Union that held the bargaining march, and that proposal was not adopted in that form.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.063" offset="2227597">Another was a proposal to simply issue a general prohibition on requiring membership in more than one Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.615" offset="2261870">Now, in the final analysis, everyone agreed to one very important point, and that is that the only item they wanted to correct, the only difference that they wanted in this particular Bill was to correct the problem of compelling a man to become a member of more than one Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.469" offset="2341282">They felt that a man should not be forced to pay dues to one Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.122" offset="2359881">The Congress was willing to permit the Union the employer to compel and to pay dues to the Union -- to one Union, but they didn't want him to pay Union dues to two.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.945" offset="2399169">And, with that concept in mind and with that overall objective, the language was agreed to by the various Unions and, ultimately, adopted by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.985" offset="2443264">And, this Court exhaustedly analyzed the legislative history on that section in the Rychlik case and held that the -- that that legislative history must be read carefully in order to understand the exact language of the con -- of the statute, and that the statute itself could not be read literary on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.069" offset="2535633">And, this Court held and it state -- and it adhered to those holdings in the Street case and in the Felter case that the statutory language must be read in the light of solving this problem and that problem, we agree with and we have incorporated into our collective bargaining agreement specific language which states that if the man has a right to work in another craft such as a conductor, and if the conductors have a contract with the railroad under which compulsory Union is a factor, he can become a member and remain a member of the Conductor's Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.972" offset="2715251">That, we say -- we assert to the Court, solves the problem of what Congress was trying to reach, and that is, the man cannot be compelled to become a member of two.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.789" offset="2758510">But, what does the Switchman's Union's have on the Milwaukee road?</text>
            <text syncTime="667.937" offset="2775124">It has no contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.898" offset="2782960">It cannot negotiate a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.541" offset="2793514">It had never did have a contract since the Railway Labor Act was passed, and it would be impossible for that Union to negotiate a contract with the employer that would compel the man to become a member of the Switchman's Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.904" offset="2847013">And, with that in mind, we have asserted that the legislative purposes served by compelling the man to become and remain a member of the Union that bargains for him and if the Union does not bargain for him, the -- if the Union is just a stranger to the property, which was Switchman's Union was in this railroad, that membership in that Union could not be used to satisfy the Union shop requirements.</text>

            <text syncTime="1142.231" offset="4672345">And, what this case is related in the sense that what we're saying to a man is that “You have a Union that represents you and you can make him represent you.</text>
