            <text syncTime="28.187" offset="216168">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.723" offset="234245">This case presents a constitutional challenge to the power of the Courts of Appeals to review the denial by the districts courts of motions for new trial on the ground that verdicts are excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.611" offset="321808">This was an action in the District Court for the Southern District of New York under the Federal Employers' Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.749" offset="358379">It was tried in two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.171" offset="372067">In the first trial, the jury found the liability of the Railroad to its employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.076" offset="399653">A separate trial then was held in which the amount of the damages was fixed by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.054" offset="431626">Judgment was entered upon the total verdict and on the railroad's motions for new trial the district judge dismissed all of its objections on the record as to matters of evidence and as to the specific argument that the verdict was excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.701" offset="534131">The trial judge carefully reviewed all of the evidence that had been produced none of which was controverted and found that an opinion which appears in the appendix that the verdict was fully justified by the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.565" offset="613648">On appeal to the Second Circuit, two judges of that Court found as did the third that there was no merit in the Railroad’s other arguments on error in the trial but reached the conclusion that the verdict was grossly excessive and directed a new trial unless a remittitur be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.290" offset="732557">The third judge who sat on the case disagreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.695" offset="754186">He found that the verdict was sustained by the evidence and the Court should not have disturbed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.958" offset="787205">We go directly to the constitutional question of whether the Court of Appeals had the power to make this order.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.859" offset="834853">The Seventh Amendment was passed upon as early as 1830 by Chief Justice Marshall’s Court in an opinion by Justice Story in Parsons v. Bedford in which this Court specifically denied to itself the power to review questions of fact which had been passed upon and approved by the Trial Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.796" offset="966510">And that was the law until 1879 when the specific question here involved was first raised in Railroad against Fraloff when this Court in an opinion by Justice Harlan specifically held that it had no power to review the excessiveness of a verdict found to be proper by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.759" offset="1114363">When the circuit courts, now the Courts of Appeals were created certainly they obtain no greater power of review than this Court when it itself was passing upon appeals from the District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.643" offset="1189909">And the history of the circuits in the early days was early acceptance of this rule which had been promulgated by this Court that there was no power under the Seventh Amendment to interfere on the basis of the excessiveness of a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.875" offset="1270888">That early acceptance gradually in the circuits one after another passed to arguments which constituted a rationalization of reasons why they should have some power of interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.982" offset="1335254">And finally in the last 20 years specifically beginning about 1948 each of the Courts of Appeals has made the statement that it has the adherent power to interfere and overrule on the basis of excessiveness alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.114" offset="1427832">Now, the Courts of Appeals have made three approaches to the statement of this power which they have that the Supreme Court did not have when it was hearing appeals itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.143" offset="1487914">First, some of the Courts of Appeals have said that the common law history which was looked to by the Seventh Amendment does not support the position that the early judges of this Court took on these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.647" offset="1577984">That as a matter of fact when we look to the history of the common law procedure before 1791 when the amendment was adopted that the British Courts did in fact review in sort of an appellant procedure the qualm of a verdict as well as the weight of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.692" offset="1682160">This I think is completely erroneous and has no basis whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.693" offset="1706193">It is based entirely on the fact that the English Court of Queen’s Bench decided en banc motions for a new trial which may have been tried before one of their judges at the assizes.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.520" offset="1777455">But Justice Story in the Parsons against Bedford case realized that as well as did all of the early judges of this Court when he said that there could be no review of questions of fact except in the Court in which the case was tried or to which it was returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.333" offset="1868675">Certainly, recognizing the fact that Queen’s Bench sat as a court en banc, and so any rationalization that the Court of Appeals today is like Westminster sitting in Queen’s Bench en banc because some of the history books tells us sometimes the trial judge did not sit in the court en banc certainly has no basis historically.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.106" offset="1991764">The fact is and the writers have said and we have studied everyone of the cases which have been referred to by any of the Courts of Appeals there is no case reported prior to 1791 in the English books in which a new trial was granted except for error of law in which the trial judge did not sit at Westminster upon the hearing of the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.816" offset="2122585">Now, a second tact that has been taken and was taken by the Second Circuit in the early cases upon which our court relied was that true it is and this Court has held that a review of the quantum of the evidence may not ordinarily be made by an Appellant Court under the Seventh Amendment because this is the review of a question of fact and that this Court has said time and time again.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.741" offset="2250376">But said the Second Circuit and others following it, there must be an upper limit that is a verdict maybe somewhat excessive we cannot interfere but it may reach an upper limit at which the question then becomes one of law and not one of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.946" offset="2347133">Then says the Court, we do not review that were verdict which the Seventh Amendment forbids us from going, we review the discretion of the trial judge in passing upon that verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.888" offset="2418918">No effort is made by any of the Courts of Appeals to explain how this question of fact, the excessiveness of a verdict is transmuted into a question of law by saying we are not reviewing the verdict we are reviewing the discretion of a trial judge and whether he has abused that discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.241" offset="2512332">And if that be true, that discretion may be reviewed and they be set aside because of abuse on what basis should it be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.905" offset="2559039">This has never been explained by any of the Courts of Appeals except to say each case must be decided on its own facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.425" offset="2597073">We will not review for mere excessiveness, but this particular case looks like one in which the trial judge was way out of line even though he saw the witnesses, he heard them, he heard all the evidence he was in a much better position that we, nevertheless, he was so far out of line that we say he abused his discretion and that then becomes a question of law, but with no explanation as to how this maybe transmuted into a question of law and come outside the purview of the Seventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.551" offset="2753599">And the third rationalization has been that modern times require a reinterpretation of the Seventh Amendment and that this prohibition against the review of question of fact in modern times must be reexamined.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.156" offset="2824025">And since this Court has gone so far as to say the changes in practice, changes in methods of an appeal, changes in pleadings need not be prohibited and we need not follow common law procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.102" offset="2887764">That therefore the Seventh Amendment may now be reinterpreted and we may now say that although ordinarily questions of facts may not be reviewed after the trial judge has approved them.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.744" offset="2950353">That in this type of case where there is an excessiveness involved this is an exception and that this Court should now reinterpret the amendment to say that here we will permit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.459" offset="3017226">This Court has never done.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.777" offset="3030497">The Courts of Appeals have on various occasions look to some of the expressions that this Court has made in refusing to pass on this question since 1879; the latest one being in the Neese against Southern Railway in 1955 where the specific question was post on a precisely similar situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.821" offset="3138644">And what this Court said there was, we will not reach at this time the constitutional question because reviewing the record we cannot say that this verdict was not without supporting the record, and therefore reversed the Fourth Circuit without going to the constitutional question and that may well be the position which this Court will decide to take in this case, because as we have pointed out, there is no justification in fact for the interference by the Seventh Circuit with this verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.678" offset="3306036">There is no justification in fact for the Second Circuit in a vote of two judges to one to decide that the trial judge who saw the witnesses and heard the evidence abused his discretion in permitting this verdict to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.332" offset="3380746">The Second Circuit majority did not even take the trouble to review in its opinion the evidence to determine whether in the language of this Court in the Neese case this verdict was without support in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.206" offset="3452217">It contended itself with saying that this verdict that appears to us is grossly excessive and it used another phrase which is difficult to rationalize it all.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.229" offset="3504253">It said that we cannot find ourselves, and I'm paraphrasing I don’t have the precise words before me, able to reach a verdict greater than so much and therefore directed a remittitur.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.041" offset="3575515">The verdict in this case was $305,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.725" offset="3594324">Trial judge found it to be fully justified by the record and so did the dissenting judge on the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.573" offset="3625671">The two judges joined in the majority opinion said that they could not find themselves able to justify a verdict beyond $200,000.00 and directed a remittitur to the amount or else a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.725" offset="3706232">Now, if Your Honors at this time as you did in Neese feel that this case does not present a question that must be decided that Fraloff and Parsons against Bedford may stand as they should until another case comes along.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.477" offset="3809259">We are perfectly satisfied of course but if there is any right of review that this Court is willing to leave with the Courts of Appeals it cannot be on such a subjective basis as two judges feel that this is grossly excessive while the trial judge and the other judge on the Court of Appeals feels that it’s perfectly proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.821" offset="3934647">There must be some objective treatment of this question and not this subjective approach to what is an excessive, what is grossly excessive, what is monstrous if this is to be the judgment upon which the Courts of Appeals are to base their decisions reviewing these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.227" offset="4024299">We have raised one other question in our brief which I think Your Honors will not require me to orally argue and that goes only to this second question that I have discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.022" offset="4083440">This was an action under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act and certainly as this Court has said time and time again the right of a jury trial and the right to have the jury verdict in violate as part and partial of that act, so that if in any case a verdict of a jury as to amount sustained by the trial judge should be sustained it is in a case under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.568" offset="4201618">Mr. Chief Justice I would like to reserve whatever I may need.</text>

            <text syncTime="1038.719" offset="4258252">Petitioner’s principle contention is that the Court of Appeals is without power to review a trial court’s refusal to grant a new trial on the ground the jury verdict is either excessive or inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.260" offset="4316453">It is claimed that the exercise of this power contravenes the Seventh Amendment of the Constitution and that it constitutes a reexamination of fact tried by jury otherwise been according to the rules of the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.835" offset="4374758">I believe it is worth making explicit that there is not involved here a question of whether a Court can look into a jury verdict for purposes of considering a challenge either to its adequacy of inadequacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.400" offset="4441004">So much is conceded by the petitioner that a Court can do that and the burden of the complaint is that a Court of Appeals lacks that power under the Seventh Amendment and that only the trial court has any authority whatsoever under the Seventh Amendment to look into on any basis the amount of a jury verdict when it’s challenge for either excessiveness or inadequacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.018" offset="4547480">In this case, the appellate court directed that a new trial would be unnecessary if petitioner agreed to remit a portion of the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.536" offset="4581543">I do not believe and it hasn’t been argued that this remittitur feature of the appellate court’s decision has any significant bearing on the question that has been raised as to the power of the appellate court to order a new trial.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Gribbon</label>
            <text syncTime="1149.310" offset="4700662">Disagreed on the facts of this case and he said that he would uphold the determination of Judge Irving Ben Cooper in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.681" offset="4734098">It appears that this question, this constitutional question has never been directed resolve by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.745" offset="4758340">In 1955, in the Neese case where the question was raised but not resolved, the Court so stated in a brief opinion, as to the cases before Neese there are certainly and must be conceded statements in cases of this Court particularly in the last century which tend to support the viewpoint that the petitioner has suggested here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.714" offset="4854262">In no case in my judgment was the kind of review that the appellate court has performed here before the Court when any sort of statements bearing on this question was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.134" offset="4903894">Now as to the cases, more recent cases in this century none of them deal directly with this problem but I think they bear heavily on the problem and that they suggest that the test to be applied in applying the Seventh Amendment is really one of substantial justice without principal regard for the forms and practices of common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.484" offset="4997308">What the Seventh Amendment does do is first preserve the function of the court in jury as they existed in common law and the essentials of trial by jury which the Court has said consist of a jury of 12 presided over by a judge and a unanimous verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.466" offset="5061256">I think that is the teaching of the cases that would come to bear in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.171" offset="5084035">As petitioner has said all 11 of the circuit courts have considered this constitutional question some before Neese, some after Neese, all of them have considered in some measure the very arguments that have presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.007" offset="5135444">Each of the 11 appellate courts has concluded that the Court of Appeals does have constitutional power to review a determination by a district judge which refuses to order a new trial on the ground of a verdict being excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.743" offset="5202317">In addition, a case decided by this Court last term Eby against the -- Neely against the Eby Construction Company while not directly in point I think by close analogy establishes the power of the appellate court to enter -- to determine that a new trial shall be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.128" offset="5283924">In that case, the Court rejected a contention that the Court of Appeals was without constitutional power either to grant a judgment N.O.V. or to direct a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.977" offset="5331257">And in so doing it specifically stated that so far as the restriction of the Seventh Amendment was concerned it really wasn’t any greater restriction on the right of jury trial whether a trial court or an appellate court were to enter the judgment N.O.V. or new trial provided they applied the proper test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.351" offset="5424776">Now, the argument is advanced in support of petitioner’s contention is I submit essentially historical based upon the practice at common law it was a King’s Bench or Queen’s Bench that seem to have plenary power over the amount of verdicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.410" offset="5493008">I submit that that argument does not support the position petitioner suggest either is a matter of history or is a matter of constitutional analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.009" offset="5531460">First is a matter of history, the argument really proves too much because at common law it was not the judge who presided over the trial that had the authority acting alone to determine whether the amount of the verdict was excessive or inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.278" offset="5592482">That power did not reside in the single judge who presided over the trial, rather the power over verdicts, the amounts of verdicts resided in the full court of King’s Bench sitting en banc at Westminster consisting of the four judges, three of whom would not have participated in the trial at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1619.982" offset="6583254">Now if the Court please, the petitioner contends that even if the Court of Appeals can constitutionally review a trial court’s refusal to order a new trial on the ground of the verdict is excessive that this Court urge in exercising the review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.082" offset="6671653">And there are two aspects to this problem, one of which the standard of review that was applied by this Court I think goes also to the question of the constitutional power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.132" offset="6719927">It is not argued here by respondent that an appellate court has exactly the same kind of a power that a trial court has in dealing with the challenge to a verdict as being excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.788" offset="6766529">The standard of review that this Court applied and that has been applied by the other to circuit courts is that every benefit of doubt must be given to the trial court’s examination of the jury verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.515" offset="6833403">Every deference must be paid to the fact that the trial court had a superior opportunity to examine the witnesses and knew more about the case, and it is only when after giving every benefit of the doubt to what the trial court has decided that the appellate court has the authority, the constitutional authority that we say the Court has here to set aside the action of the trial court as being either without support in the evidence or an abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.404" offset="6952939">Now, the Second Circuit and perhaps the most detailed examination of this problem in the Dagnello case in 1961 in which this Court denied cert went into great detail as to the limits of appellate court review of the determination by a trial judge not to grant a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.971" offset="7027231">That decision of the Second Circuit was written by Judge Medina who wrote this opinion here and he incorporated the views expressed in the Dagnello into his decision here and said he was applying the teaching of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.133" offset="7075924">And the Dagnello decision elaborated on a number of words that had been used to describe the kind of determination that the appellate court must come to before it was justified in rejecting the determination of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.665" offset="7142066">I think that the words overly, excessive, monstrous without any support in the record all seemed to me to mean about the same thing and that is that giving what the district judge has decided as to the excessiveness charge of diverting giving that every benefit of the doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.130" offset="7215940">Nonetheless the appellate court concludes that the amount of the verdict simply does not comport with standards of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.491" offset="7249377">It may be abuse of discretion is as good term can be use, but in any event the appellate court is giving the District Court, the trial court in these circumstances I suggest exactly the same kind of benefit of doubt that a District Court must give to a jury verdict in considering whether the evidence is sufficient to go to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.421" offset="7333073">Every benefit of the doubt must be resolved in favor of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.049" offset="7351568">Now that is precisely what Judge Medina did in this case here, giving every benefit of the doubt as he said to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.108" offset="7383855">His conclusion joined in by the other member of the court was that nonetheless the jury verdict was outside the bounds of appropriateness as set by legal standards not simply by subjective standards.</text>

            <text syncTime="1842.557" offset="7473612">Let me deal with that now and I would like to suggest briefly at least four different elements that I believe fully support the determination by the appellate court here that the verdict that was entered was in excess of any legal standards of reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.391" offset="7548949">In the first place, the complaint in this case asked for $250,000.00, $55,000.00 less than the verdict that was brought in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.490" offset="7585311">Now I don’t suggest that the plaintiff shall never be able to get any more than he asked for in his complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.186" offset="7608090">But this complaint was not a do-it-yourself-job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.666" offset="7618017">It was not prepared by inexperienced counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.262" offset="7628466">The plaintiff has been exceedingly well represented all the way through here and able trial counsel rarely understate the ad damnum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.915" offset="7659081">Therefore, I believe it was quite appropriate for the appellate court to consider the amount ask for in the complaint as one of the operative facts in looking to whether this jury verdict did exceed the bounds of reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.492" offset="7713311">The second point and this too was considered by the appellate court is that the plaintiff here did not suffer injuries to the vital body functions or even lost of limb.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.110" offset="7763780">His own doctor who was entirely candid in his examination said that the plaintiff was left all in all with the poor functioning foot, a tie had fallen on his foot in the course of his work on the railroad and smashed a couple of toes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.106" offset="7827832">He had been subjected to considerable hospitalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.282" offset="7840475">There is no question that the plaintiff suffered damages, he was hurt and he suffered injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.321" offset="7868688">On the other hand, he didn’t suffer a loss of limb, a leg wasn’t amputated and as long as it is necessary under our legal system of law to equate suffering and damages with dollars some kind of rules have to be employed in order that the damages shall be in accordance with some standard of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.654" offset="7953951">So that the doctor said all in all he’s got a poor functioning foot, and while such a handicap as this is admittedly serious I suggest it is not worth in the parlance of damage awards, the lost of a leg, an arm, or eyes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2655.119" offset="10723871">Not just to second guess of it but to give him every possible benefit of the doubt and in some few instances they're going to conclude that this was beyond the bounds of reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.716" offset="10762219">We are -- we have put into our appendix to our brief a quite complete list of jury verdicts in recent case and dollars that have been awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.462" offset="10805269">And I think it is from a distillation of those cases that the common law principles of excessiveness of verdict must be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.616" offset="10841840">As the Court please, in closing let me suggest if I may that I think the second aspect of this case that is whether the appellate court should be upheld in reverse in a District Court calls really for more than most cases that quality of judging that Judge Learned Hand spoke up on the occasion of his 50th anniversary on the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.898" offset="10922924">When he said that the judging was in the nature of an art, the judge has some vague purposes and frames of references and among these he must choose but choose he must do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.753" offset="10962422">Now, unfortunately, the choices that are made here really can't be proven by words or numbers the way you would prove a mathematical or a logical proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.841" offset="10998784">But I submit that the manner in which this District Court particularly in the light of its Dagnello case, this appellate court went about resolving this question shows a thoroughly objective and reasonable resolution of the interest of the parties and should accordingly be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2757.240" offset="11132322">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.657" offset="11149981">I would be perfectly willing to retry this case before this jury if that is the Railroad’s position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.760" offset="11186448">I don’t think that we should have to retry a case in the Court of Appeals on damages and then the Supreme Court on damages and that's precisely what counsel for the Railroad here is contending that we must justify now before this Court that its members would determine what was the proper amount that should be awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.931" offset="11283101">This was the particular purpose of the Seventh Amendment when it was passed that this should not occur in the Supreme Court or in any appellate court in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.017" offset="11331480">Now, if I may, I'd like to answer a few of the questions that were asked and some of them maybe very relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.485" offset="11361364">A question was asked by Mr. Justice Harlan I believe as to how long the case took the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.888" offset="11382888">That appears in the docket entries it started on February 21 and ended on March 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.811" offset="11410578">Now, that doesn’t tell the whole story of course because February 22 was a holiday and I'm sure there was a weekend involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.205" offset="11440149">I know that I went back and forth in Philadelphia many days to try the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.271" offset="11464495">The question was asked by Mr. Justice Black as to the practice in Pennsylvania with which of course I am very familiar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.697" offset="11494170">And that carried out the common law practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.873" offset="11506813">It still does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.657" offset="11514023">A case tried by a single judge, a motion for a new trial is heard by the three judges of which he was a member of the panel unless it is waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.936" offset="11563133">But that question is not new to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.307" offset="11584554">This Court had the same question before it in Metropolitan against Moore when the question arose as to whether the general sessions of the then Supreme Court to the District of Columbia was the same court as the special session that tried the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.146" offset="11655920">And that was precisely what you had in England as Mr. Justice Black pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.839" offset="11678699">You have one judge sitting in assize and the motions for new trial came to Westminster and he sat there with his colleagues the three others and they decided the case that's what this Court said was not an appellate review in Metropolitan against Moore in the general sessions of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.018" offset="11767411">Now, finally, I suppose I must make an answer to the question asked by Mr. Justice Harlan as to the ad damnum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.013" offset="11811401">The Court of Appeals said in its opinion although it did not discuss or try to justify in any way it’s cutting down the verdict, it did say that the fact of the ad damnum claim less than the amount awarded to the jury has some significance according to its language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.550" offset="11901576">What significance it doesn’t say?</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.772" offset="11914428">Well, let's examine it for just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.684" offset="11926131">What's significance?</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.909" offset="11935013">This man was injured in 1962 and this action was started in 1963 and it didn’t come to trial until 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.898" offset="11982973">The ad damnum was fixed in 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.626" offset="12005857">It wasn’t amended until after the trial and at that time it was amended with leave of court and there is no contest by the Railroad that that isn’t proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.639" offset="12045876">It’s been done hundreds and hundreds of times and has always been held to be proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.022" offset="12067506">But the important point is this and the Court of Appeals recognized is it and the record shows it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.968" offset="12095195">The ad damnum clause was never mentioned to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.455" offset="12113168">The jury never saw the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.654" offset="12126020">The jury was on its own on the facts to determine the amount that should be awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.973" offset="12151306">Now, where my friend gets this figure of $126,000.00 I do not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.646" offset="12173981">It is not in the opinion of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.945" offset="12195192">The figure that the lower court mentions was $155,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.645" offset="12225912">We have indicate plus $27,000.00 which would be $182,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.964" offset="12251199">We have indicated in our brief that they very may well have awarded $192,000.00 without going -- stretching themselves one bit for loss of future earnings and as Mr. Justice Marshall just said the only question here is how much of the jury of awarded for this man’s pain and suffering.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.569" offset="12341687">Is this Court going to decide that because if the Courts of Appeals are to decide that purely on the basis that this is grossly excessive then mustn’t this Court also determine whether the Court of Appeals has abused its discretion in deciding that the court below has abused its discretion on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.548" offset="12433533">I like particularly also something that Judge Leonard Hand said but in this specific connection and I have it on my brief in discussing this type of review they call the attention of the fact that Court of Appeals must come at the matter ones removed not in the position of the trial judge.</text>
