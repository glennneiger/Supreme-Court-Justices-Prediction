            <label>Mr. Gerrit H. Wormhoudt</label>
            <text syncTime="15.182" offset="164133">At the close of argument yesterday, I was trying to establish that there has been an existence long before the enactment of the federal rules, a body of law derived from the Acts of Congress and interpreting decisions of this Court which are applicable to the jurisdictional requirements for Federal Courts, that body of law being independent of and indeed I think superior to the rules of practice that this Court may promulgate from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.544" offset="309582">Because of that body of law I think we have Rule 82 of the present federal rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.604" offset="345840">Rule 82 provided initially that none of the rules would be interpreted to extend or limit the jurisdiction of Federal Court when the 1966 amendments were adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.601" offset="413759">Rule 82 was restated making reference to admiralty but continuing the restrictive language I’ve just mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.954" offset="459212">I submit that Rule 82 is there simply as a guide to construction and an admonition that in interpreting the rules they simply shall not affect the jurisdictional standards of the Lower Federal Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.862" offset="538833">I would now direct the Court’s attention to the nature of the particular claims involved in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.967" offset="567254">I think I mentioned yesterday that neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals attempted to categorize the claims involved in this action as (b) (1), (b) (2) or (b) (3) claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.137" offset="615946">I don’t think there can be any question however that if this is a proper class action, it must fall within the terms of rule -- of subdivision (b) (3) of amended Rule 23 which refers in substance to cases presenting common questions of law or fact where the predominating common question would take precedents over any separate questions arising out of the claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="174.986" offset="803297">I think in respondents brief, references made to the fact that prior to the amendment cases such as we have here today involving separate and distinct claims really amounted under the prior rule to a permissive joinder en masse so to speak under prior Rule 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.106" offset="895770">That being the case, I do think then we must consider as Mr. Justice White was suggesting yesterday the logic of applying or abandoning the aggregation doctrine under (b) (3) cases to the other rules which deal likewise with permissive joinder and subdivision (b) (3) certainly presents an instance of permissive joinder provided by its own terms that any pardon may opt out upon recieve of notice that he has been included in a class which is in litigation before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.997" offset="1063372">So, consequently we still have the permissive feature involved in at least Rule 23 (b) (3) cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="248.666" offset="1098062">I take it you would say that in an action by stockholders in cases where they have similar claims that three stockholders sued the same defendant and they all were named plaintiffs that each would have to have the necessary jurisdictional amount.</text>

            <text syncTime="285.229" offset="1244244">There may be special instances and departures from the derivative rule but normally that stockholder's actions present but a single action on behalf of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.332" offset="1288652">Consequently, there would not be a joinder problem under the situation you put.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.719" offset="1318222">Perhaps there may be another state jurisdiction if so, I'm not familiar with the problem that would be present.</text>

            <text syncTime="348.074" offset="1495646">And it seems to me also on those lines that if aggregation has not been permitted under Rule 19 in an ordinary permissive joinder case where all the parties are before the Court they're identifiable and certainly res judicata would apply to any matters litigated where the parties were named that in a situation where all the parties may not actually be before the court, there is even less reason to aggregate their claims in order to satisfy jurisdictional amount then there would be in an ordinary permissive joinder situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1017.393" offset="4172988">I think we have two platforms from which to look at the question before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.750" offset="4206320">The first one being the proper effect and interpretation of amended Rule 23 and the second one being whether there is any substance to the argument here that the effect of the amended rule is to extend the jurisdiction of Federal Courts unlawfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.023" offset="4291480">Now, most of the questions that if occurred or that had been asked from the bench in the preceding case and in this case really concerned the first question, the proper interpretation and application and practical effect of Rule 23 on class litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.328" offset="4372668">So, I want to address myself to that aspect of what we have before us first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.825" offset="4398686">I'm embarrassed to say that I have a somewhat different view of amended Rule 23 than seems to be the view by any of the three preceding counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.893" offset="4442990">I see Rule 23 as it's now amended as an attempt to straighten out and do away with some terrible problems that confronted us in the practical application of former Rule 23 and very briefly what I am referring to is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.379" offset="4520939">Former Rule 23 did have its origin as one of the counsel stated in the old equity rules but when Rule 23 was promulgated, it appears from the history that Professor Moore undertook to categorize the circumstances under which you could have a class action and he came up with a three categories which were not resided in the rule by name but were described really in subdivisions (a) (1), (2) and (3) of true hybrid and spurious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.137" offset="4667956">Now he thought and I think the bar thought and you can find in the literature statements by writers to the effect that this was a clear rule and plain English and everybody could understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.457" offset="4705155">I think everyone thought that those categories are going to work well and they do work well when you're talking about property rights and they had some historical basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.101" offset="4751757">If you were bringing a -- if two people were joined together to -- as plaintiffs to try title to quarter section of land, what any problem to understand that they could aggregate their claims, they were all going to be bound by the judgment, you really had one piece of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.885" offset="4810898">And we have what we call in rem jurisdiction and all these things were familiar to lawyers and they understood them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1186.520" offset="4849455">And it was really aggregation of plaintiffs and not aggregation of claims at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.634" offset="4865860">Now, Professor Moore attempted to apply that the class actions and I think the history demonstrates that it works well when you're dealing with property or a fund but class actions very quickly became broader than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.107" offset="4923852">There were all kinds of rights and all kinds of situations developed chiefly by modern commerce that demanded, cried out for adjudication by class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.436" offset="4965125">And it isn't a question of increasing case, load as a question of decreasing and when we try to extend these categories beyond property rights, we got into trouble and we got in to bad trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.253" offset="5016430">Rule 23 left cases spread over our reports that simply couldn't be rationalized or harmonized in certain areas, one of them being the question of jurisdiction that we have before us both as to amount and as to diversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.556" offset="5085602">Now, there was no problem about aggregation when you talked about a claim to try title where you have more than one party but when you got down to what Professor Moore termed and the committee termed a spurious class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.054" offset="5143594">You have the literature which said this really isn't a class action at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.025" offset="5159476">This is a permissive joinder device.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.912" offset="5170970">Well then, you were face to face with this problem not only as to jurisdictional amount but as to whether or not intervenors had to show diversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.397" offset="5212975">Another area that we have which was -- which develops some terrible law was in the effect of a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.250" offset="5232410">As a matter of fact the burden of my argument will be that those two are bound up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.095" offset="5251741">If you are going to bind a class with the judgment then you have the amount in controversy is the effect of that judgment on the class and that's the value you have to look at.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.382" offset="5296880">But in under old Rule 23, when we got down to the effect of the judgment, we developed the set of laws which said that in true class actions those really involved in property or something directly related to, all of the class was bound.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.450" offset="5357171">In Hybrid class actions, they were bound but to a lesser extent and under different circumstances and frankly there were so many different decisions that I haven't been able to figure out when they're bound and when they're not in a hybrid class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.532" offset="5405550">In a spurious class action, the law is clear that no one in the class is bound except those who intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.878" offset="5438882">But -- and that seems reasonable, somewhat reasonable until you carried another step.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.303" offset="5464586">The practice developed of starting a spurious class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.202" offset="5480155">The other members of the class who were aware of this anomaly which sit on the outside and able to wait until the case was adjudicated or almost adjudicated until it became clear that the plaintiff was going to win then they'd come in and intervene, say we want the benefits of the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.230" offset="5548283">But the problem was that it was a one way intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.943" offset="5563120">They could stay out and not be bound if the -- if the defendant won and they could come in and be bound if the plaintiff won.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.930" offset="5591124">Further than that the courts quickly confronted themselves with this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.813" offset="5610663">Here is what we call a class action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2517.472" offset="10173210">I want to fortify the proposition with the statement that originally, century ago, more than a century starting I think in 1843, we first begin to have these questions, this -- the circumstances where aggregation was allowed were really comparable in terms of commerce then and in terms of the lack of complexity of litigation then as compared to now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.820" offset="10286686">They were allowing aggregation where it should be allowed, where the matter in controversy was $10,000.00 or at that time $500.00 or more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.154" offset="10327960">All I'm saying is that procedures like suits of clothes ware out and no longer fit the necessities of commerce and human relations and that's what has happened with the old concept of true, hybrid, and spurious and that's what happened with Rule 23 originally, it wore up in 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.885" offset="10414895">And I think that the present rule that we have now, the amended rule is splendid, will solve the problem and directs itself to the problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="2608.945" offset="10539133">The other people, there might be another man who has $10,000.00 even, that's his claim, a stockholder and we are saying to him you can't come in, you can't start the action, you can't represent the class but to Mr. B who has $10,000.01, you can, the door of the courthouse is open to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.447" offset="10617187">Well, the arbitrary limit is fine in private litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.174" offset="10636100">It must be made to limit litigation in Federal Courts but when in reality, when the man comes in to court, he presents and there is adjudicated not only his claim but a whole class of claims, it doesn't make any sense.</text>
