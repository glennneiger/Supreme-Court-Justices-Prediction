            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 40, William Joe Johnson versus Areas Avery, Commissioner of Corrections.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.507" offset="197360">Mr. Warden.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="karl_p_warden" startTime="24.494" stopTime="321.071">
            <label>Mr. Karl P. Warden</label>
            <text syncTime="24.494" offset="201331">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.099" offset="219721">I'm counsel for William Joe Johnson who is a prisoner in the Tennessee State Penitentiary in Nashville, Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.585" offset="253680">As of the time of this argument today, William Joe Johnson has served approximately three years in solitary confinement or in maximum security or in a segregated environment within the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.923" offset="323062">This confinement is over and above that confinement called for by his sentence, which is a life sentence for the crime of rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.408" offset="369037">The reason for this extraordinary confinement is because he has violated one rule of the Tennessee State prison system is that rule is here being challenged today, and that rule is that no inmate will advice, assist, or otherwise contract to aid another either with or without a fee to prepare writs or other legal matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.387" offset="484916">The United States District Court that first heard this case determined that his confinement was arbitrary and capricious and that it was in violation of Title 28 United States Code Annotated Section 2242 and it was in violation of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.347" offset="556805">The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.123" offset="571852">Our argument here today seeks to have the United States Court of Appeals reversed to have further enforcement of this prison rule ended and to have William Joe Johnson return to the general prison population and these lib -- these unnecessary restraints on his liberties ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.973" offset="655235">Now, the basis for our argument is five-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.249" offset="672371">The two major points that we wish to make are that, first off, the State of Tennessee, by enforcing this prison rule and by providing no alternative assistance, has effectively blocked access to the Courts by those prisoners who are indigent and inarticulate or illiterate, and that to so prevent these people from being heard as a violation of due process, a violation of equal protection, and a violation of the First Amendment Freedoms of Speech and right to protect, right to petition for redress of grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.402" offset="832972">And, our second principle point is that this prison regulation is not a proper exercise of the state's limited power to regulate the practice of law for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.308" offset="884590">One, this is not the practice of law and, two, that even if it should be considered the practice of law, it's beyond the power of the strait -- of the state to restrict this particular kind of practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.117" offset="943835">Our further points are that Title 28 Section 2242 of the United States Code, annotated, reflects the ancient common law right of one layman to prepare, sign, and verify petitions of habeas corpus for those who cannot help themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.601" offset="1021785">And, the final two points, are that the petitioner does have standing to raise these issues and that was the holding of both the District and the Court of Appeals and, finally, that this is a proper case and circumstance for Federal Courts to intervene with state prison management.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.999" offset="1095346">And, apparently, this has been agreed to by the State of Tennessee in its supplemental brief provided that the Court finds that these regulations are in violation of federal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.834" offset="1142680">Now, as to our first point, it's clear that a prisoner who can employ an attorney will be fully and well-heard by whatever Court he wishes to petition, but it's equally clear that if this prisoner is indigent, that he only has then four alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.821" offset="1222614">One of these is to be able to talk some lawyer into representing him for free.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.671" offset="1246020">The second is to proceed pro se, the third is to get help from someone untrained in law, and the fourth is just to forget about it all together and let his claim go by the Boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.361" offset="1296802">Now, as to the first of these alternatives, if he can talk a lawyer into taking a case, all of us who practice law know what happens to the attorney who agrees to help one indigent prisoner, he's immediately inundated with letters from not only that prison, but from every prison in the country requesting similar aid.</text>

            <text syncTime="362.655" offset="1553951">Although, I expect to argue a bit today that these forms are in fact not much better than the no assistance at all that the State of Tennessee provides.</text>

            <label>Mr. Karl P. Warden</label>
            <text syncTime="378.392" offset="1616959">Your Honor, in the event that this attorney does receive these letters, what happens ultimately is that the claims -- the just claims and the unjust claims are like all going away splash kit.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.834" offset="1670666">Now, while we ought to applaud an attorney who is willing to help an occasional indigent prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.129" offset="1695848">We still cannot rely on causal or whimsical charity to preserve the constitutional guarantees of persons and fritz in the United States and it's not a sufficient answer here to say that prison authorities will help these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.304" offset="1768573">First off, there's no showing that these prison authorities, the guards, chaplains, clerical help, or any more competent to provide assistance that is a fellow inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.705" offset="1814235">And, secondly, it's clear that the prisoner knows full well that the interest of his keeper and his own interests are not absolutely identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.494" offset="1861360">There is and there always will be a real credibility gap between the inmate and his keeper, and the prisoner is going to want someone he can turn to, someone he can talk to, someone he can trust, if not his lawyer, then his friend.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.850" offset="1926771">And, his friend is much more likely to be a fellow inmate than it is to be his keeper.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.303" offset="1952580">And, I think that millions and millions of dollars that the legal profession and the government has spent in the past few years trying to bridge the communication gap between the poor and the Courts, the legal profession, by moving law offices out in the neighborhoods and by allowing forms of lay intermediary assistance all show that this credibility gap here is a very real thing and ought to be recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.701" offset="2062190">And, finally, on that point as on the side, if it is the practice of law for an inmate to help write petitions, why is it not the practice of law when it's done by a prison guard or a chaplain, as apparently is done in California?</text>
            <text syncTime="507.120" offset="2131884">The activities of --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="507.756" offset="2134392">The difference, I suppose it's -- it doesn't go to your question, your rhetorical question, but the practice is, is it not, that people who indulge in the activities, in which your client was to indulge, actually charge their fellow inmates everything that's traffic or bare and, presumably, prison employees do not.</text>

            <label>Mr. Karl P. Warden</label>
            <text syncTime="536.840" offset="2250689">Your Honor, there is not one shred of evidence in this case that my petitioner has charged anyone for his services.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.986" offset="2279320">I don't deny that prisoners could charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.514" offset="2293426">I would deny that it would be a proper thing to do, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.083" offset="2319653">The activities of the petitioner here are attacked as being the practice of law and it's said that the state has the right to regulate the practice of law and that, since petitioner was practicing law, he can be properly stopped by the state prison authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.120" offset="2387884">Well, we claim first that this is not the practice of law, that there was no claim here whatsoever to represent these prisoners in Court that there was no pursuit of these cases beyond the minimal help of helping them articulate what their claim was, that he did not stand and verify these petitions for the inmates, that he returned these petitions to the inmates and they signed them and verified them themselves even if they had to sign it with an “X” as happened in some instances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1368.542" offset="5577540">Your Honor, I am of the opinion and impression, I should say, that it is a fairly common prison regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.968" offset="5607215">I think California has it with the little variants of the form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.409" offset="5624978">When I was in Utah recently, I saw something in paper out there that said they have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.873" offset="5642846">I think New York has it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.970" offset="5651205">There are a number of jurisdictions that have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.930" offset="5659042">I can't tell you how many they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.754" offset="5682343">The state has also claimed an interest here which the prison authorities say fall on their side of the scale of balancing the interest and that is in keeping the Court dockets from being clogged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.716" offset="5738245">What this rule prohibits was fine in equal impartiality, the legitimate claim, along with the illegitimate claim, and there certainly can't be any kind of a showing that a legitimate claim filed by an inmate who had inmate assistance clogs the Court any more than a legitimate claim filed by an inmate who has a lawyer to help him or by an inmate acting pro se.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.816" offset="5834585">And, this rule prohibits all of them, the legitimate claims and the illegitimate claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.190" offset="5872097">Under the very narrow view, I think narrow, of the State of Tennessee and the State of California, the presumed state interest here in prohibiting the unauthorized practice of law seems to be served in whole part by allowing people to appear either pro se or with attorneys, and this ignores completely the indigent and illiterate incompetent who can neither act effectively nor can they afford an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.472" offset="5985259">The statistics that are provided by the State of Tennessee show that 44% of the people in the Tennessee State Penitentiary are of below average intelligence and 22% of the people in the Tennessee State Penitentiary are of defected mentalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.355" offset="6056835">Now, these people might be able to scratch our something on a piece of paper, a lot of them can't even do that, but it just does not seem realistic to me to say that they can act effectively pro se, that they can call their claim to the attention of the Court or a lawyer in such a fashion that that claim would be understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.490" offset="6137292">And these people are the ones being discriminated against.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.400" offset="6161011">The State of Tennessee has provided no alternative means for these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.921" offset="6187029">The State of California has provided a series of forms that these people might use and fill out, but the central question on those forms that these people are to fill out for themselves is really the central question that must be answered in Tennessee, and that is that this inmate must be able to articulate why it was that he has been deprived of his constitutional right, just a simple statement of the deprivation of constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.081" offset="6307715">Well, I found it a bit difficult to pen a simple statement of a detriment of constitutional rights and I've had the benefit of a legal education, and these people matriculated in the streets and I don't believe it's taught there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1577.327" offset="6412727">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.888" offset="6422967">On the question of federal statute, I have said in my supplemental brief that I really don't think that that's a serious question because, there, the statute says that application for writ of habeas corpus shall be in writing, signed and verified by the person for whose relief it is intended or for someone acting in his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.818" offset="6506663">I don't think that goes any further than the ministerial act of signing or verifying a petition to be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.688" offset="6538115">I don't think that contemplated the preparation of petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.092" offset="6551698">So, I don't believe that that statute can be relied upon as was done by the trial judge, the district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.608" offset="6589837">The Court of Appeals thought to the contrary and I think, certainly, that that's too broad an interpretation for that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.221" offset="6624214">Now, on the question whether or not this is a practice of law, I don't think that answers the question because, certainly, the State of Tennessee can't regulate the practice of law in such a way as to deny prison inmates aaccess to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.850" offset="6670817">So, I think this is a different situation really from what it is on the outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.929" offset="6691088">I've tried to think, well, here are inarticulate people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.346" offset="6708746">You have people who can't write their names. You have the same type of people on the outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.605" offset="6725778">So, why wouldn't the same rule apply?</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.367" offset="6732884">Well, the only difference I could see, and I think this is favorable to the people inside the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.489" offset="6761305">They really have more calls, I think, the petition of course than the people do on the outside and I think that might -- that's justification for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.452" offset="6793174">So, I think, certainly, that any rule that the State of Tennessee has that would tend to deny these people access to the Court, we don't contest that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.327" offset="6828701">We know that that would be in violation of a constitutional right.</text>

            <text syncTime="2750.124" offset="11103901">This man said, and his counsel said it at the hearing in the Federal District Court, that he expected to continue to write writs without regard to what the regulations were or without regard to anything else, except when another means was provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.555" offset="11161579">So, in order to stop him not as a matter of punishment, he's got to be segregated or the prison officials have got to spend their time surveilling the other prisoners to see that they don't get his help.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.625" offset="11209853">So, it seems to me, like it's a lot easier and a lot more justifiable to put this man in prison and then spend the remainder of the ti -- or then you -- the officials have got more time to spend with the other prisoners, given them the help they need.</text>
