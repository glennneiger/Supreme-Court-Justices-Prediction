            <label>Mr. Harris Weinstein</label>
            <text syncTime="22.702" offset="194226">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.268" offset="212407">This is a labor case which comes to the Court on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.345" offset="248769">The sole issue to go is to the scope of the remedial powers of the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.590" offset="281684">The exact issue was this, once the Board has found an unfair refusal to execute a labor contract made include in its order a provision that requires the respondent to pay past fringe benefits that would have been required to pay, if it had executed the contract at the time we fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.742" offset="386382">The Court of Appeals said, No, the Board may not do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.320" offset="400697">It may not direct payments required by a collective agreement and that the remedy is not a Board order but it must be by way of suit under Section 301 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.065" offset="455659">And this, as we have pointed out in our petition and in our brief is in conflict with the views expressed in several other circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.802" offset="490559">The case arose in this way, the respondent Joseph Strong is in a roofing business in Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.981" offset="527339">In 1963, when this critical series of begun, he was as he had been for many years before a member of a contractor's association that was a multi-employer bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.750" offset="594422">He was contractually obligated to abide by the contracts of the association negotiated with unions including one that represented his employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.297" offset="644577">He will also as obligated if he was going to stroll.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.266" offset="660459">To do so, at least 60 days before the termination of the contract period.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.400" offset="688985">The old contract, that is the one that's owed in the context of this case, was due to expire in the middle of August of 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.406" offset="732975">Negotiations took place during the first half of that year and on August 14, the union and the contractors association reached agreement on a new four year contract to take the effect the next day, August 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.235" offset="800266">A year and a half before in 1962, respondent had written a letter stating his desire to terminate the non-agreement and nothing came about.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.481" offset="849272">Then on August 20 in 1963, a few days after the new agreement was reached, he sent a letter to the Joint Industry Union Grievance Board, expressing a wish to become a non -- to withdraw to become a nonunion member, to terminate the new contract as to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.877" offset="946866">Although the association, the contractors association changed its status on its books and refunded a security deposit and terminated the bond that was suppose to secure his payment of fringe benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.485" offset="1005275">The union on three occasions approached him, beginning in October 63 and then again in November and fall in April and asked him to sign the contract which he refused to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="249.181" offset="1100048">The Court pleases, as just before the recess, I've mentioned that on three occasions between October 1963 and April 1964, the union asked that respondent to execute the Bargaining Agreement and each time, he refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.240" offset="1164309">On the basis of these facts, the union filed unfair labor practice charges in the Board upheld and ruled that respondent had not under his duty to bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.399" offset="1216972">On a petition for enforcement, the Court of Appeals upheld the substantive findings and last January, this Court denied respondents petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.565" offset="1261589">So as the case stands, respondent has been finally adjudicated to have unfairly refused to bargain and the controversy goes to the Boards order.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.203" offset="1308191">That order is set out on pages 120 and 121 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.415" offset="1341001">It has in paragraph 1 some cease and desist directions which are not in controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.100" offset="1367751">It directs in paragraph 2(a) that respondent execute and honor the Agreement that was negotiated and that is not in controversy.</text>

            <text syncTime="416.706" offset="1770245">And these are amounts measured by the hour of each employee that were supposed to be paid to provide for a variety of fringe benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="455.236" offset="1924368">The Court of Appeals analysis was, as I understand it, that the unfair labor practice was not the failure to pay these amounts but was instead just a refusal to execute the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.433" offset="1985076">And it said that the order was, and I'm quoting from their opinion, An order to respondent to carry out provisions of the contract and it is beyond the power of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.456" offset="2041187">So the Court of Appeals ruled that if an order of the Board directs payment of a benefit required by a contract, whatever else the circumstance is the Board doesn't have power to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.805" offset="2098552">The only recourse to the union or its memberships would be a suit against the employer under Section 301 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.866" offset="2138885">Now, at the time that we filed our briefs here, I believe there had been eleven cases on this or related matters and this was the only one that found the Board without power.</text>

            <text syncTime="602.589" offset="2513690">Now in the final analysis, the resolution of this case depends on the construction as placed upon Section 10 (c) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.850" offset="2562800">That tells the Board what to do once it finds an unfair labor practice and as the source of the Boards remedial authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.731" offset="2598327">Now, essentially, that tells the Board to do two things, First, to enter a cease and desist order which it did here; and then, it tells the Board to take such affirmative action including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay as well effectuate the policies of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.605" offset="2693831">A long line of cases, going back to the inception of the Wagner Act, this Court has looked at this language and it is considered what it allows the Board to do and perhaps the most recent summary of the authorities is in the five aboard decision in 379 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.359" offset="2768854">But the thrust of it is simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.529" offset="2781497">The Board is directed to take affirmative action and that action should be whatever is needed to restore things to what they would have been without the unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.796" offset="2830608">And that serves two functions: First, it restores the bargaining process.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.393" offset="2852968">It let's operates it operate as it would have without the unfair activity; second, it takes the profit out of unlawfulness.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.476" offset="2897272">It takes away any hope of gain through refusing to bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.825" offset="2918693">It deters the particular respondent and other people from illegal conduct and encourages them to voluntarily perform their duties under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.195" offset="2972191">Now, we would think that under this analysis, there's extremely strong case for our decision without looking further.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.430" offset="3013047">The Board has an affirmative duty to provide relief, to restore the status quo ante the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.321" offset="3044707">The cases, the 11 unsolved cases that have been reported in the Court of Appeals on this subject show that basically there are two patterns.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.111" offset="3083786">Either as in this case, the employer has refused to execute a contract that has been negotiated by him or on his behalf and the Board, among other things, says to the employer, Pay whatever you would have had to pay if you would executed the contract in a timely fashion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1141.305" offset="4668583">One is that there is Section 301 which confers jurisdiction on the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.466" offset="4689272">The other is that Congress declined to make breach of a contract by itself in unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.613" offset="4721873">It's a pretty weak reads but the inference of the Court of Appeals through is directly refuted by the Act because Section 10 (a) of the Act says that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.011" offset="4767431">The Boards power to remedy on unfair labor practices shall not be affected by any other means of adjustment or prevention that has been established by agreement law or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.904" offset="4818944">And, the interesting thing is, that Congress don't seem to get any thought that there was any possibility that it was the best thing the Board of jurisdiction to act in a case like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.398" offset="4856978">It did express some concern that Section 301 could be limited to situations where there was no unfair labor practice and the Committee report recognizes that possibility and expressly says that when there are two remedies - one before the board and one before the Courts, they are cumulative and not mutually exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.373" offset="4948825">Now, this Court also have to say it's not riding on a thin slake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.014" offset="4971395">If my count is correct, this is the 7th time in 7 years that the Court has had occasion to comment on this particular problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.633" offset="5005876">The first three cases involves the problem that was predicted by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.962" offset="5031267">Are the Courts in some manner preempted the one case, Lucas was questioned as our state courts preempted of jurisdiction by Section 301 without regard to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.250" offset="5084348">The next two cases, the Smith against Evening News Case in 371 U.S., Carrie against Westinghouse in 375 U.S, the question was whether the Board had exclusive jurisdiction to the delegation of the courts when there was both an unfair practice and a violation of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.410" offset="5177031">Now, the issue wasn't before the Court in those cases but in each of the opinions, the Court took care to say that it was not suggesting that the Board was without jurisdiction and expressly said in each instance that there were dual remedies available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.750" offset="5246412">The next two cases, were companion cases in 385 of US reports, C &amp; C Plywood case and the Acne Industrial Case - and then each of those, the contention was that the Board was without jurisdiction in matters that could be adjudicated before the Courts in a 301 suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.790" offset="5350484">And in each instance, this argument was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.683" offset="5378069">And then, in the Great Dane case later in the same term, a similar argument had been made in the Court of Appeals but was dropped when this case reached this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.374" offset="5412864">But the Court's opinion again points out that the fact that there is jurisdiction in the courts under 301 does not deprived a Board of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.571" offset="5461661">Now, I suppose that these cases could be distinguished from C &amp; C Plywood and Acne Industrial on the ground that those cases involve the subject matter of the Labor Board; in this case involves its power authority where its subject matter of jurisdiction is not in issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.601" offset="5545775">But we would suggest that these cases an easier one for finding Board jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.016" offset="5567404">In those instances, the problem was there were matters in dispute that might have been resolved or left through litigation in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.473" offset="5609305">Here, the disputed matters at least, as the contentions have been framed, are not things that are ordinarily decided in the Courts in Section 301 (6).</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.068" offset="5659669">The contract has been used [coughing] simply as the measure of the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.849" offset="5674820">It's just the same, I would think, that if the Board in ordering back pay as used in oral rate established by a contract in so many art today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.998" offset="5711391">I suppose if we follow through the Court of Appeals' analysis to its logical conclusion, [coughing] the Board can no longer order back pay if the back pay is based on a rate established in a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.079" offset="5759666">There's nothing in controversy here on what the contract means in terms of the fringe benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.626" offset="5789863">They set out their numerical -- there's just a calculation to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.636" offset="5809925">And all the reasons alluded in this Court's opinion in C &amp; C and Acne would seem to require the same result here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.945" offset="5851199">For example in Acne, the Court discussed the difficulties that would arise from having two proceedings and matters of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.758" offset="5882441">There's no reason to put the union or its members to a duality of proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.927" offset="5903130">There's no reason to think that the Board is devoid of jurisdiction, wants it to act to cure a violation that it's found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.491" offset="5941373">I think there's one other point that requires brief mention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.347" offset="5960808">Much of the respondent's brief on the merits is devoted to an argument that the grievance and arbitration provisions of this particular contract forbid the Board's action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.293" offset="6008560">As I understand that they are saying that whenever there is an arbitration and grievance procedure, the Board can't make any order that could have been entered by an arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.721" offset="6058297">Well, first, I think this is the first mention of arbitration in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.621" offset="6073866">I'm familiar with no request for arbitration nor suggestion that this matter could have been arbitrated and I would assume from the way the arbitration clause is worded, it's should question whether the arbitrated would speak to the existence of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.376" offset="6140844">But all this isn't really pertinent because I think the Court again has disposed of the contention both in the case of Carrie against Westinghouse and the Acne Industrial case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.254" offset="6188387">Each time the Court had occasion to discuss the interrelationship between arbitration and the Board's activities, in Carrie the claim was that the Board's jurisdiction excluded arbitration; in Acne the claim was the presence of an arbitration clause for the Board to act in each time the Court held that there was a duality of jurisdiction and pointed out that the reasons that were applied in Steelworkers trilogy to require the courts to defer arbitration didn't apply in a Board proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.916" offset="6343032">No doubt the Board here could have, if the matter warranted it send them direct arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.493" offset="6365393">It could have deferred to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.618" offset="6373857">But there's absolutely no reason why it had to withhold its hand and instead rely on some other internal inter-party process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.360" offset="6416802">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1582.633" offset="6433938">Mr. Chief Justice, may It please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.093" offset="6447731">At the outset, I would like to emphasize four questions of facts that would -- should keep on mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.586" offset="6485765">First, Mr. Strong was bound by the industry contract as a matter of law at the time that it was negotiated in August of 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.146" offset="6531950">The bylaws of the association so provided, the Board's brief, page 2 concedes the record 35 and sets out the bylaws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.579" offset="6569671">Under Wylee vs. Livingstone in this Court's decision, Section 301 action that appellee arbitration would certainly have been proper in Wylee as you recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.880" offset="6622856">The employer, who was held to be bound to arbitrate that was not a party to the Contract as predecessor company was a party and this Court held that he must arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.964" offset="6675205">Furthermore, that the failure to pay fringe benefits was not alleged that's an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.005" offset="6703417">So either the complaint or found by the Board or the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.498" offset="6729331">The order finally is to pay to the appropriate source any fringe benefits provided for in the above-described contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.352" offset="6792756">We feel that this case presents for the first time a conflict between a national labor policy preferring arbitration and the position of the Labor Board that it has the power to decide whether we have breached the contract by the failure to pay fringe benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1697.342" offset="6892753">That is basically, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.386" offset="6904874">A similar conflict, the course has been resolved by this Court, a conflict between Courts and arbitrators had been resolved by this Court in the now famous trilogy wherein the policy was set that in labor management matters it is for the arbitrator to decide that a Collective [coughing] Bargaining Agreement is not a contract and from our law, it says it's a code of conduct and that the arbitrator should be free to imply provisions that may or may not exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.032" offset="7039457">Now, the same reasons apply that to keep the Court out of such disputes, to keep the board out of such disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.287" offset="7076551">As this Court said, the ablest judge cannot be expected to bring the same experience and competence to bear on the determination of agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.374" offset="7116884">Similarly, the Labor Board, just as the Court, does not have the competence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.675" offset="7142066">The Labor Board has been given by Congress competence in its field to determine whether the Act has been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.154" offset="7179995">It is not, we submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.731" offset="7190340">With all due respect, they've given the Labor Board competence to decide breaches of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.146" offset="7219911">The Labor Board interestingly enough in several very recent cases, we respectfully submit it as demonstrative and it is not so competent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.856" offset="7262751">And Adams Jerry this case is we have not cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.178" offset="7280097">They are Labor Board cases but in a series of Labor Board cases commencing with Adams Jerry, including the CNS Industries, the Labor Board has held that if the contract is silent about a particular provision, then the employer or the union, whoever it may be, is not bound or arbitrate or the Labor Board can interpret that provision in a way it wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.241" offset="7404335">Now, that is a strict disagreement with the decisions of this Court and the Trilogy that holds that where a contract is silent, an arbitrator might well imply a restriction or a right from the conduct of the parties or from other source.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.727" offset="7486255">The reading case, the Warrior case in this Court was a subcontracting case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.456" offset="7505168">Here, in Adams Jerry the Labor Board held that you shouldn't have to go to arbitration because the only thing the arbitrator can do was to interpret the contract under its provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.089" offset="7551770">This, to me, shows that the Labor Board does not competence of the trilogy and the arbitrator has more power than to just interpret the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="3539.854" offset="14262836">I don't say it has the option because the Board issued an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.779" offset="14286451">The question is what does the order mean if you ordered these people to pay pursuant to the contract?</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.918" offset="14315081">If you order them to pay pursuant to the contract, the next question is whether that is to be determined in accordance with the machinery provided by the contract or has the Board pro tanto displays that machinery of the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="3573.025" offset="14395434">I think the fair answer to that was that because there was no suggestion before that anything other than a mathematical computation was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.022" offset="14439424">The Board, in writing its order, didn't consider whether pursuant to the contract incorporated submission to the trustees under what I told the state clause of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.377" offset="14488848">It seems to me that if that contention is really to be brought in that there would so equitable grounds that would require a lesser payment that the mathematical computation calls for that the burden would be on the employer, dwell into the Board and request elaboration of its order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.978" offset="14575261">It seems to me that the Board has the authority to do it either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.357" offset="14592815">And in this case, what's been brought into oral argument here is a matter that was not brought to the Board itself in a timely fashion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3720.503" offset="14985383">The question here is doest the Board have power under the Act to order the payment of fringe benefit provided for in a contract?</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.170" offset="15028015">The objection is, as I understand it, that would amount to the Board interpretation and enforcement of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.765" offset="15074408">Now, do you tell me that the Board has merely ordered the payment to be made the amounts had been determined in accordance with the contract by the contract machinery?</text>

            <text syncTime="3758.329" offset="15136684">If on the other hand, you tell me that the Board has in effect going to supplant the machinery provided them in the contract.</text>
