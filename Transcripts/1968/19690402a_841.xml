            <text syncTime="14.220" offset="160266">Yesterday afternoon, inquiry was made I believe by Justice White relative to the significance of some language in the trial court's order pertaining to the inability of the defendant or his counsel to prepare a transcript from memory.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.505" offset="229439">The reason for this is the courts in Oklahoma have set this as one of the prerequisites for furnishing a free case-made and we think that it's significant for the reason that by implication it indicate that for this requirement to have any relevance, it must mean that if the defendant or his counsel could prepare a transcript that the court would consider it.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.430" offset="321076">We'd like to further remind the Court that part of this record has already been transcribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.885" offset="346885">That three of the witnesses that petitioner maintains or material had -- their testimony has already been prepared in narrative form, that the only testimony needed were the three witnesses that testified in behalf of the city and the defendant and we believe that this could be prepared in narrative form and we think that the courts, that the appellate court below would consider it in that fashion.</text>
