            <label>Mr. Edwin M. Zimmerman</label>
            <text syncTime="40.816" offset="266637">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.047" offset="291610">This case is on appeal from the United States District Court to the middle district of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.964" offset="319195">In 1963, the United States filed a civil complaint under Section 1 of the Sherman Act alleging that at least since 1955, the defendant companies engaged in the business of selling corrugated containers in the Southeastern United States unlawfully combined to exchange among themselves information as to prices they charge are quoted “specific customers,” for the purpose and with the effect of restricting price competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.752" offset="462346">The case was submitted to the District Court for decision on the basis of proposed findings, many of which were agreed to as well as on the basis of extensive depositions taken by the plaintiff of various offices of the defendant, and of exhibits introduced by both parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.836" offset="542699">The United States asserted the evidence as to defendants course of conduct over the eight year period, compelled the conclusion that a combination existed whereby defendants finished to one another upon request information as to the most recent prize or current quotes, any member of the group was offering to a specific customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.677" offset="634128">The United States also asserted that under the facts of this case, such combination was unlawful because it had the purpose and necessary effect of restricting prize competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.220" offset="688253">The District Court handed down its decision on August 31, 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.975" offset="711241">It dismissed the Government's complaint with prejudice and we accordingly appealed to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.662" offset="734020">In brief, the District Court concluded that no combination for the furnishing of specific prize information was proven.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.612" offset="765785">It further found that even where there such a combination, it was not unlawful since there was no further agreement among the defendants to use the exchange price information to maintain prices or minimize price reductions.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.306" offset="836629">We believe the District Court was wrong as a matter of law and not finding that a combination existed and that it also applied an erroneous legal standard to the question of legality of the combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.120" offset="895875">They agreed upon facts described this market, the corrugated container industry in the southeastern part of the United States does over $100 million worth of business each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.144" offset="939969">There are some 10,000 purchasers of corrugated containers in this region.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.611" offset="961808">The group of 18 defendants in this case account for 90% of the shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.047" offset="983542">As defendant's brief points out, the four largest defendants account for 45% of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.337" offset="1020740">It is also the fact that the six largest defendants account for almost 60% of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.942" offset="1051146">The number of sellers interested in any given purchase was also limited by such considerations as the geographic proximity of the buyer to the seller's plant, the suitability of the seller's equipment, the attractiveness of the order and the particular product mixed than being manufactured.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.821" offset="1146650">The business is essentially accustomed order one with each purchaser indicating the particular specifications of its box requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.983" offset="1183326">The buyers do not carry inventories and they must buy for immediate needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.881" offset="1202866">Price is the consideration which determines to whom a buyer gives its business.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.851" offset="1222823">Since, there were no quality differences among the products offered by the sellers, a box made to particular specification is identical to any other seller's box.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.880" offset="1266918">The industry throughout the period was characterized by chronic overcapacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.491" offset="1293354">The Court found that as to each defendant, that when it considered it necessary to ascertain from a defendant competitor, the most recent price to a specific customer or when to ascertain the accuracy of a customer's report of another competitor's price, that information was usually requested from the competitor then supplying the customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.054" offset="1419577">The Court also found as to each defendant, that when such a request for information as to the most recent price to a specific customer was received, that information usually was furnished and it was accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.636" offset="1489899">After receipt of the information, each company was free to do with it, what it wished.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.384" offset="1512887">Although the findings again show, and is say it finding 28th, that “in the majority of instances, the recipient quoted or charged substantially the same price as the price given by it's competitor in response to its request.”</text>
            <text syncTime="373.270" offset="1596479">This interchange was engaged in throughout the eight year period except when for brief periods for defendants went as one witness put it off the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.541" offset="1649560">In such cases, the defendants would neither give nor request the price information.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="393.398" offset="1676936">Does the evidence show Mr. Zimmerman, the uniformity of prices throughout the industry?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_m_zimmerman" startTime="398.821" stopTime="629.173">
            <label>Mr. Edwin M. Zimmerman</label>
            <text syncTime="398.821" offset="1698670">No, it does not Mr. Justice Harlan, and I think this would enable me to clarify what this case is not about because it's not about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.980" offset="1731271">For one thing, this case is not about an express agreement, it's about a combination which is revealed by a persistent course of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.501" offset="1769409">Secondly, it's not about the claim of specific price fixing, as for example, the Government charged in the electrical price conspiracy cases where in submitting bids on custom-made equipment as here, manufactures were accused as of conspiring as to who would bid, what price, it's not about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.617" offset="1853837">We are claiming a combination that meliorates that bigger of price competition, that inhibits it, that breaks it.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.230" offset="1884244">To express the distinction as to the conduct, it was as though the electrical equipment manufacturers in submitting competing bids to public utilities on a custom-made machine agreed among themselves in order to alleviate the perils of inadvertent price cuts, that anytime a perspective seller on a piece of business was uncertain as to what a competitor was bidding, that information would usually be accurately supplied by the competitor upon request and the favor would be returned at some future point.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.048" offset="2023528">This is not a case that seeks to outlaw the availability of price information.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.943" offset="2047143">The trade association and this case supplied its members with monthly price configures and would weekly analyze price trend information computed for each defendant and that is not challenged by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.852" offset="2098761">Published pricing manuals existed and those are not challenged by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.332" offset="2120704">The defendants had available to them their own cost information, and the wrong record of prior pricing and as the findings indicated, prior pricing to a customer tended to be carried forward, unless there were significant cost changes or unless market conditions altered and purchasers could reveal to competing bidders if they thought it improved competition the bids they had received.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.830" offset="2234702">Hence, this is a not a case that challenges as illegal, any acquisition of information needed for intelligent marketing initiative decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.884" offset="2270960">It's a case which claims the defendants have through the combination become too precise, too detailed, too knowledgeable about the specific plans of each other, and it's this precision that inhibits price competition a conclusion verified in this case by uncontroverted deposition evidence, that the parties to the information exchange regarded it as assurance against unnecessary price cuts.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.489" offset="2377331">Finally, Mr. Justice Harlan, we do not claim that the agreement froze prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.665" offset="2401991">This industry according to the findings has throughout the period in question been characterized by overcapacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.588" offset="2433755">A condition which ordinarily makes for a vigorous price competition that works to adjust the capacity to demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.612" offset="2465834">The fact that under the circumstances, prices varied and business shifted is not as significant as the uncontroverted fact that despite the chronic overcapacity, new entrance were attracted to the market, an indication that market competition was not doing its job of balancing capacity and demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.067" offset="2555591">My task is to persuade you that the course of conduct over the eight-year period, evidence is a combination and that this combination is illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.499" offset="2593416">Because I do not read defendant's brief as showing much heart for the proposition that a combination did not exist.</text>

            <text syncTime="647.318" offset="2692681">Yes, the fact that there was extensive new entry despite the fact of chronic overcapacity indicates that something is wrong in the pricing.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.643" offset="2733955">If you had competitive pricing, typically overcapacity would lead to depression of profit and less attractiveness for new entrance into the business and our judgment to the fact that you have no entry despite the chronic overcapacity suggest that something isn't working.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin M. Zimmerman</label>
            <text syncTime="725.573" offset="3005628">Mr. Justice Fortas as you and I are at the same point in my argument, the District Court stated that if a combination existed, it was not unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.078" offset="3039692">It appear to thank that the critical question was, whether the defendants had a further understanding to use the exchange price information to inhibit competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.762" offset="3094444">The Court found that each party made an individual decision as to pricing after receiving the information and decided that no further agreement could be inferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.595" offset="3137703">That therefore refuse to consider the significance of uncontroverted evidence, which the Court itself described as showing that most defendants felt that the price information was needed to maintain prices and minimize price competition that might otherwise exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.409" offset="3204995">And here is my point Mr. Justice Fortas, as we did not clam that in addition to the information exchange, you needed a further agreement on how to use the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.655" offset="3250030">The proposition we advanced to the Court, is that when a group of sellers who account for by far the dominant share of the market combined to meet or call one another when there was a substantial doubt as to what some member of the group may be bidding on a particular piece of business, and when they were motivated to such a combination by their concern, that failure to have such complete and precise information could lead to price cutting.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.499" offset="3377403">Even though each party walks away from the meeting with the nominal freedom, the charge as he pleases the necessary effect of allaying the doubts and resolving the uncertainties in this context is to mitigate price competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.095" offset="3447724">Of course, if they had the further agreement as to specific prices, the arrangement would be blatantly and criminally unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.959" offset="3483251">But under the circumstances of further agreement it's not necessary unless this be regarded as noble doctrine, I refer you to this Court's decision and American column, 257 U.S., now 399, the Court again in an information exchange agreement noted that there was the absence of a further agreement as to pricing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1208.055" offset="4935555">If I'm selling a box for a dollar and I don't give you the information, you got to guess at my price, and I don't want you guessing 68 cents of my dollar price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.219" offset="4980276">If you are going to cut it, I would rather you cut a penny to 99, don't make me look like an idiot, that's why Dixie container gives prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.740" offset="5018311">Other officials testify the exchange of information presented -- prevented destructive price competition, avoided the necessity of pricing as low as he was willing to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.764" offset="5066480">The District Court erroneously because it insisted on a further agreement ignored this evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.459" offset="5093230">But, even if we didn't have this evidence, we think that the necessary effect here where you have information requested at times of uncertainty by members of irrelatively small group of sellers, six of whom did almost 60% of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.467" offset="5181210">Under circumstances, where self interest would dictate minimization of the rigors of price competition and where the buyers demand was fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.042" offset="5223528">We think that under such a situation, so long as pricing was clearly visible to one another, so long as any uncertainty was avoided, it would not pay anyone substantially to cut prices since the others could know of match the cut, and the share of the business would have to remain the same at a lower profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.589" offset="5313703">The individual self interest of each participant could be relied upon to mitigate competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.472" offset="5341288">Once the combination to exchange information was in effect unpredictably and this is very important, the evidence showed in the Court found that in the majority of instances, the recipient of the information in fact quoted substantially the same price it had received.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.594" offset="5409729">The District Court discusses the fact that the information exchange was for the purpose of enabling informed marketing decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.500" offset="5437419">But, the Court treats informed decision making with an undiscriminating reverence and Linseed Oil and American Column revealed the dangers of over specificity on current prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.097" offset="5487783">The point is that but for the information exchange, occasions would have a reason when the defendants would have been slightly in the dark as to how low they would have to bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.784" offset="5526549">These are the occasions when the buyers determine it is not in their self interest to educate the bidders as to the precise state of the competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.842" offset="5570748">On those occasions, but for the combination, the competitors would have consulted their own cost and the extensive general price information available to them and submitted a price that warranted them a profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.764" offset="5618395">Defendants argue that without the information they may have bid to high.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.753" offset="5638353">But, they had a good idea of the level of prices and if they bid to high the buyer would probably tell them and in fact the Court found that many buyers gave high bidders a second chance to meet the lower price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.370" offset="5684851">It's not in the buyer's interest by being silent to induce high price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.205" offset="5704182">He's interested in doing and inducing low prices, indeed if it want a specific information, the serious risk existed that the uninformed seller would bid too high one wonders why each competitor assisted his colleague to avoid such a mistake.</text>

            <text syncTime="1548.330" offset="6296743">Current either because they were current quotes or current because they were last sale transactions which in the context of this particular industry was a very good indication of what the seller who gave that information would next charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.670" offset="6358079">Now, we argue that the buyer would not ordinarily act against the self interest and by remaining silent co-sellers to bid too high, and we think that as this Court has recognized extensive and specific information on current prices available to a relatively small group of sellers buying for the same market, will resolve in mitigation of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.679" offset="6466121">The agreement here, the combination of the understanding evidence by the course of conduct over eight years and before can be understood by a sellers desire to avoid the possibility that his opponent had kept in the dark, may comment at a lower price and again, I note the explicit testimony which reveal this, which I referred to earlier, and the Court's finding that in most cases in fact, upon receiving information, the recipient quoted the same price as the price furnished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.817" offset="6590673">I'd like to turn for a moment to the question whether there was a combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.458" offset="6605197">The court below seem to think that this could be regarded as unilateral conduct as in Theater Enterprises, but we're not dealing with unilateral conduct such as refusal to deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.375" offset="6648874">There were two parties to each request and each answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.513" offset="6665383">Furthermore, the District Court itself referred to an implied understanding that by giving the information, one gets the right to request the information and indeed I read appellee's brief of page 13 to concede that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.949" offset="6731212">Hence, the conduct is not only bilateral joint, it's interdependent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.458" offset="6753155">One simply doesn't do it without reliance in what the others are doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.564" offset="6769664">This is evidence by the fact that when a company went off the air, it went off the air both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.211" offset="6792234">It didn't continue furnishing information, it not had furnished nor requested information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.550" offset="6813550">The District Court was also mislead by the fact of request varied in frequency that information was supplied in different forms and that the defendants retain the freedom to stop furnishing information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.191" offset="6856182">The variations and frequency merely met that the agreement worked when it had to, namely in those occasions where there was uncertainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.543" offset="6889514">Where the buyer wasn't talking or wasn't being accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.933" offset="6911143">The different forms of the information as I try to explain to you Mr. Justice Fortas did not make very much difference because with the manuals that existed here and with the practices of the trade, the information was readily translatable and we can't assume that the parties here were engaged in a useless exchange of stale information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.287" offset="6992541">Finally, the fact that each company maintain its freedom to furnish information is another way of stating that it pertain that the right to depart and go off the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.730" offset="7026291">The fact that they usually furnish information, rather than always furnish information does not mean that there was not a course of conduct here, such usual conduct over an eight year period is evidenced enough of a combination even the most explicitly conceived conspiracy does not operate to perfection.</text>

            <label>Mr. Whitney North Seymour</label>
            <text syncTime="1890.880" offset="7666918">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.476" offset="7673292">Let me in the few minutes, just try to summarize the situation as I see it as a result of Mr. Zimmerman's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.098" offset="7711744">This case were filing -- all the respondents who filed the common brief in this case because the question was common to all of them, the common denominator was that all of the defendants from time to time, when they couldn't get the information from their own records and they didn't trust the information when they got it from the buyer, would call up another manufacturer and ask him for his last price, and this was done by telephone, and this is the universal practice which is challenged in this case and the Government says on that fact alone and the speculation that people would not cut their prices anymore and they had to, we will establish the combination of violation of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.427" offset="7893034">Now it -- the meetings that counsel has talked about as Your Honors will find are few smaller trait gossip meetings involving three or four of the defendants not challenged as illegal and not a part of this practice at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.882" offset="7954892">They were just thrown in for color and the practice was this telephoning practice which I referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.331" offset="7984671">Now, Mr. Zimmerman said that after they telephoned, the fellow got the information was nominally free to go about his business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.712" offset="8022183">It's stipulated and it's found that every one of the prices fixed was priced -- was fixed in the individual judgment of the seller in his business judgment alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.537" offset="8065546">He was nominally free, he was free and he exercised that freedom and there's not a word of proof in this case that he was under any restraint or under any coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.962" offset="8111208">Now, come after recess to the precise manner of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.178" offset="8136077">And the fact that there was wholesale price cutting in this industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.470" offset="8157288">The prices went down and the prices vary, people were taking away customers all the time from other people and they were not nominally free, they were free, that's the heart of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.351" offset="8196786">Now, what is the Government really challenging here?</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.506" offset="8209429">The Government is really challenging the maple flooring decision under the guys of not challenging it by saying, that when there's an exchange of price information or when there's price information furnished and the word exchange is not an accurate one, because there wasn't an exchange here, each companies sometimes go to another company and gather information, it's only in that sense that there was an exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.288" offset="8300544">What they're really saying is that such a practice, one not disapproved, not specifically disapproved in a consent decree which has been on the books for 28 years and which everybody has relied upon, that such a practice is now per se unlawful, and that the Court are to so declare because this case was tried on a stipulation, the findings were largely agreed too, where the findings weren't agreed to, they were based upon documents or other stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.666" offset="8434082">And so, the Government is coming in and asking the Court somehow to review not this ordinary findings of the District Court, but are to renegotiate the stipulation, and though I submit that when Your Honors look at the stipulation and the findings, you'll find that the conclusion of the District Court reach was inescapable on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.823" offset="8518614">Now, if there is a case, some other case, in which there is supplying of price information and some kind of an agreement as to the prices, some kind of a stabilizing of the prices, some kind of a uniform of the prices, none of which were present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.688" offset="8582144">Let them bring such a case and give this Court and the trial court the economic pieces which this Court has insisted in White Motors and others is essential if it's to expand the group of per se violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.023" offset="8635434">This is not a proper case for expansion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.544" offset="8649540">So, that that's the summary of our position and I will -- just say this in addition before the lunch recess.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.217" offset="8700217">This was a practice followed by the 18 defendants in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.969" offset="8723205">Those in existence said that the time of the consent decree by them and by their successors, large and small and it was regarded as vital to their operation to know what the price alternatives of buyers are, and that's stipulated, and that's agreed and they agreed findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.338" offset="8808678">This is vital information and it's stipulated as to each company that the company needed the information in order to compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.634" offset="8845876">This was a highly competitive business as Your Honors will when you see the charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="2204.214" offset="8920273">And I submit that the idea that our great economy has been built by balancing demand and supply into a position where it can't grow or shouldn't grow is a kind of a fantastic approach to the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.494" offset="9013373">May it please the Court, perhaps just a little more on the nature of this industry, as I think I've said this case challenges the trade practice which goes back to at least 1940 when the consent decree which did not enjoined the dissemination of information on best transactions was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.278" offset="9116505">There are 18 of the 51 companies in the Southeastern part of the United States involved in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.751" offset="9146389">The number of companies and the number of plants has grown because the business of the customers have grown has been an enormous increase in the furniture business in the southeast and that's one to the main purposes of the use of these containers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.492" offset="9209292">The containers are used to ship furniture, fruit, cigarettes and other things while they're made to specifications anyone of the companies can make them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.986" offset="9255267">There's no published market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.321" offset="9264671">There is no -- there are few published price list and therefore in order to get information to enable a company to compete, it has to get it somewhere, and the Court found that -- and it was stipulated that it was vital to have information about buyers alternatives here as elsewhere and the usual method of getting information was to -- if the seller had to sell the purchaser before to look at his own records and if not to ask the potential customer what he was buying for and usually the customer supplied that information, obviously it was to their advantage to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.750" offset="9446379">And if not that then occasionally and usually according to the findings where they had some doubt about information which was supplied by the customers, did the practice of telephoning and getting information from the competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.506" offset="9513357">But, when the information was obtained from competitors while the findings indicate that in a majority of cases, the new potential supplier would bid the same amount that he understood was being bid by his competitors, if he couldn't get the business that way, he cut the price and if he cut the price, the old supplier would cut the price and it happened all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.326" offset="9608652">And the findings indicate that price competition was rife, that it was highly competitive business and that this practice of price cutting went all the time and I'm going to show you some affirmative evidence or I'll tell you about some affirmative evidence before I get through.</text>

            <text syncTime="2469.032" offset="9979486">He is a very able and tough adversary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.828" offset="9990666">The Court urged the parties to try to get together on stipulations instead of taking the Court's time with a lot of miscellaneous testimony and exhibits and after Mr. Bronstein had deposed 34 representatives of the defendants, they proceeded to the stipulation table and after some months there, the stipulations which are in this record were arrived at and I submit that its not an occasion for looking in to little fragments of the deposition as Mr. Zimmerman did in one reference this morning in saying “well, look at this, here the Government has stipulated the facts, the basic facts, the broad sweep of facts and I submit there's no occasion for the Court to have to revert to these depositions but if you do, you find as in most other depositions or testimony of 34 witnesses that some say one thing and some say another and its out of the total of this that this stipulation was arrived at.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.152" offset="10239979">And you can find a little fragment here, a little fragment there that will support almost anything but you can't find any that will show that there was any agreement on price or that anybody was constrained as to what price he should charge, he didn't have full freedom of action and that I submit is the key to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2732.701" offset="11034206">Where the parties did not agree and there in some cases, the Court basing his conclusion on the stipulation or documents of record made independent findings but the critical findings, the dispositive findings here stem from the stipulation and the agreement I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.678" offset="11122082">Now, -- if Your Honors will look at the sweep of those agreed findings and the sweep of the practice of price competition and the need for this information and how it was used, you'll see one other thing which I ought to mention at this stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.372" offset="11184880">If a supplier had supplied the costumer before he could find out the price of course by looking at his own records, the price he charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.037" offset="11231483">Now, one did not always adhere to the same price and he couldn't rely on the fact that another supplier would adhere to the same price because it's also stipulated that if there were changes in cost or changes in supply or changes in specifications, those prices would not be adhered to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.384" offset="11312880">So you cannot take it just because the price was charged once that it will still be the charge -- the same charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.049" offset="11343600">After the costumer or after the records of the supplier as a source, the supplier would then ask the costumer and the costumer would supply information, sometimes information which the supplier doubted but usually supplied information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.863" offset="11410787">Now, the important part of this is that it didn't make the slightest difference where the information was obtained as to how the seller who got the information behaved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.780" offset="11458539">He behaved in exactly the same way in seeking further business, whether he got the information from his records or from a costumer or from a competitor and therefore to say that any of the alleged defects stem from this exchange of price information seems to me to be without foundation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.744" offset="11546311">Now, I'm going to push on here and say only that as we've said in our brief, it -- I think the Government's statement of the questions really rather elides the fact that so much of this record was stipulated and basis it rather on some fragments here and there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.840" offset="11634709">I said before recess that it really were there was a common denominator here of the practice which was challenged, which was the practice of getting information by a telephone and then supplying it in due course when it was asked for on a wholly different transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.487" offset="11717360">Mr. Zimmerman said this morning that in some cases, people gave not only past transaction information but current code information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.232" offset="11760306">Now, its clear from the findings that only a part of all the defendants ever supplied the code information but the case was tried on the assumption that it was the common denominator information that was the thing that bound all these defendants together and therefore I submit that there's no occasion to explore separately the few cases where there was quotation information supplied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.130" offset="11859884">If that made a difference, the Court would have to dispose of the case by dismissing as to some and not as to others and what the Government was trying to do as it just trying to do here is to hold all the defendants together on the exchange of information about past transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.801" offset="11918608">The fact that some defendants might have interpreted that phrase differently, I think does not affect the basic legal position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.753" offset="11950373">Now, on the question of combination, I won't take any real time on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.796" offset="11982555">I must say that the cases don't clarify entirely what is a combination and what is a conspiracy or an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.958" offset="12031248">Here, what happened was that a supplier would call up another supplier and ask for some information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.045" offset="12067506">Knowing that in due course that supplier might expect to have the courtesy reciprocated not in connection with that transaction but in connection with the wholly different transaction and that's all there is in the way of consensual basis for whatever this -- whatever you want to call this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.177" offset="12136051">Each supplier had sometime asked and then as a matter of reciprocal courtesy at some other time supplied some information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.365" offset="12180877">Sometimes a few request, sometimes more request and so you have a sort of a situation of reciprocal commercial courtesy at work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.798" offset="12230614">Now, the Government says that's enough to make it a combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.327" offset="12244720">It seems to me not to fit any of the existing authorities on that subject but it isn't vital because if it was a combination, it was not a combination to restrain trade because it did not result in restraining in any degree the price which any supplier would get for his product.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.189" offset="12336149">It did neither coerce nor restrained and so however you break it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.920" offset="12355062">If you say it was a combination, it was not a combination in restraint of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.040" offset="12371571">My own view is that the District Court was quite right on this record in concluding that this was sort of like the mutual courtesies which we all do each other and which cannot be regarded as a combination just because we expect when we give him.</text>

            <text syncTime="3111.546" offset="12549517">Well, may I at this time ask those of Your Honors who want to look at Charter two, look at volume three which contains significant information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.827" offset="12602702">The Government put in no proof about the course of price history and the defendant's confronted with this kind of a record did their best and these charts in volume three show it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.821" offset="12654634">Now, the first chart in volume three shows how prices of everything else was going up while the prices of containers were coming down, a practice which result which one would not expect if there was any kind of a price conspiracy or price fixing arrangement however tenuous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.184" offset="12740106">The next group of charts shows how the prices varied between the defendant's plants and shows that there was absolutely no uniformity of price as between the defendants or within plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.759" offset="12806457">The next group of charts which is a very significant group which begins about the middle or begins on page 21, shows the business gained and lost by these defendants and it shows on page 22 for example, in those columns that each of this companies in every year gain some business and lost some business to competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.472" offset="12917217">And for example in this chart on page 22, the Container Corporation which is my plant in the year 1960 did business with about a third of -- about of third of its costumers were people with whom it had not done any business the year before and about a third where people with whom it didn't do any business the year following.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.077" offset="13003630">Now, it's found and stipulated that generally speaking, costumers change suppliers only when they got a cut in price and therefore it's reasonable to infer that all this changes were results of the price competition in the industry and the fact that there was widespread price cutting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.901" offset="13082937">Now beyond that, the next group of charts shows how the price went in almost -- almost like a seismograph during a convulsion and the prices went like this as between companies and as between plants and because of the difficulty of getting more than five lines on a single chart, that these are rather grouped geographically as plants of various competitors but Your Honors will see as you look through this that the price was all over the place and was all over the places between plants and as between defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.315" offset="13228596">And then going on, there's another series of charts stored at the back of the volume which shows that there was a great variation from so-called manuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.215" offset="13276244">Now, each company had a manual which views to compute price although they were rarely if ever published and their manual was departed from as shown here both up and down, usually down for manual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.131" offset="13339878">So, nobody who knew what anybody else's manual is could surely compute the price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.820" offset="13362657">And then finally, there's another group of charts in that same part of the volume which show departure from board prices which is another possible way of computing the price.</text>

            <text syncTime="3445.900" offset="13886986">I think what the Court is saying really is that you have to have a combination which restraints trade and if there was a combination, it didn't show any restraint of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.337" offset="13932753">And what do you say its one agreement or two agreements doesn't make much difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.092" offset="13943724">The fact is that they did not prove any such restraint, the record shows the contrary and now, let me push on very rapidly just to touch on the couple of other points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.296" offset="13992521">The Government relies here on the cases decided before Maple Flooring, American Column and Linseed Oil and the Sugar institute case decided after Maple Flooring and says these, this arrangement was or this combination was invalid under those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.122" offset="14075904">Now, I won't take Your Honors time to try to describe those cases but Your Honors will recall that they were very tight and explicit arrangements by which in every case, information about prices was supplied, there was per leasing of the price structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.284" offset="14152495">In the Column case, the prices went up over a 300% as a result of the arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.449" offset="14173184">In the other case, they were stabilized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.725" offset="14182275">There were fines and forfeitures in the Linseed Oil case for any departure and there's nothing of that kind here and Maple Flooring I submit lays down the principle that knowledge which invokes the self interest of sellers and lets the sellers use the knowledge to compete in any way that suits there situation which is the situation here clearly permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.515" offset="14297422">The kind of information that was supplied here and that was recognized when the consent decree was made and largely in reliance on the Maple Flooring case but my friend says, “well, in Maple Flooring, they didn't have any information about particular costumers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.694" offset="14358131">But they did in the Cement Institute case and the Cement Institute case, information was supplied about particular costumers because of the fact that in that case, it was the practice to order cement from a lot of different suppliers in order to get a lower price even if you weren't going to use it and that was kind of a commercial fraud and the information about that could be exchanged.</text>

            <text syncTime="3618.922" offset="14579022">But they exempt the exchange or dissemination of information about past transactions and it stipulated and found that every defendant relied upon the provisions of that consent decree and doing the business this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.674" offset="14638059">And I submit that of course the consent decree is not binding on Your Honors but at some precedent for the fact that the Government has recognized for a long, long time that this practice does not have the pernicious effects alleged now and if this practice elsewhere does have such pernicious effects so that Your Honors can be asked to extend again the area of first day violation, it ought to be approved and ought not to be assumed just on the basis of speculation.</text>
