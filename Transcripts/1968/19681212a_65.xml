            <text syncTime="12.313" offset="152639">Mr. Chief Justice and it may please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.078" offset="163715">I would like this morning to turn and address myself to petitioner's contention that his conviction on charge for transporting and concealing marijuana on which the tax hadn't been paid in violation of Section 4744 (a)(2) of Title XXVI is unconstitutional because the conviction on that count violated his privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.028" offset="251486">To a certain extent, the claim raised here is identical to that presented in the case to follow this, United States v. Covington.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.282" offset="280534">There is a significant difference, however, because in this case, we do have a factual record against which petitioner's assertion of this claim can be judged.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.113" offset="319822">I'd like to turn to that record, if I right, for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.397" offset="332988">Prior to trial, petitioner's counsel moved for a continuance to allow him to prepare his defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.164" offset="360051">In the motion for continuance, petitioner's counsel stated, this appears at page 34 of the record, “Defenses will be raised which would show that this defendant is an authority on psychedelics drugs which this defendant maintains, includes marijuana and that he should be have the right of experimentation with such drug, including marijuana and that, although there are provisions in the law, which would seem to allow a person to experiment with marijuana, such provisions are in actuality non-existent because it is not possible to obtain an order form and legally pay the tax on marijuana and any use without such order forms are held to be illegal”.</text>

            <label>Mr. John S. Martin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="122.733" offset="594317">And that unfortunately is true of the other point that I intend to refer to at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.257" offset="616364">At the close of the case, petitioner moved for judgment of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.994" offset="631306">That time, his counsel stated, this is at page 493 of the record, under the tax count, doctors or scientists working in a laboratory can obtain marijuana, but not those who are using it for religious beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.901" offset="694941">And again at the close, after the verdict had come in -and the motion for new trial which was filed, -counsel argued, -this is the written motion for new trial submitted after the judgment, it appears at page 649 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.549" offset="769546">The Court erred in denying defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal as to count two and three of the indictment for the reason that the evidence demonstrated, the defendant transported and possessed marijuana in pursuit of his free exercise of his religion, in pursuit of scientific experimentation out of the laboratory and in pursuit of his right to bring up his family according to his own honest belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.645" offset="861915">And since the $100 an ounce tax is a prohibitive tax, conviction on the count three as well as count two would violate the First, Fifth and Ninth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.049" offset="923564">It is the government's position in this case that petitioner from the outset recognized that his failure to comply with the Marijuana Tax Act was not the result of any fear that he would tend to incriminate himself, but rather on his recognition that the Act acted as to him as a total bar on his right to possess marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.983" offset="1007261">We submit that the petitioner correctly construed the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.965" offset="1019277">That it's our contention that the Marijuana Tax Act as construed and applied, does not compel self-incrimination because it prohibits those who could not legally deal in marijuana from handling marijuana.</text>

            <text syncTime="242.708" offset="1074239">Do we test the right of a man's Fifth Amendment rights by what happens at preliminaries in the proceeding or by what happens at the trial?</text>

            <text syncTime="256.341" offset="1128782">Well, I think, Mr. Chief Justice, what we have to do is examine the validity of the claim and I think it has to be examined against the factual basis of what he believed, his counsel mentioned yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.679" offset="1174131">Petitioner testified at the trial that he knew he could not obtain marijuana under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.093" offset="1195760">So, you have that also.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.933" offset="1203075">It is position that here the tax Act in question was designed by Congress to prohibit, and that is clearly stated in each of the reports accompanying the legislation that the Bill was designed to prohibit those who could not legally handle marijuana from doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.404" offset="1269008">Congress did this by imposing a prohibitive tax.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="294.488" offset="1281337">Perhaps, unfortunately, Congress didn't set the statute up that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.923" offset="1303071">Congress set this up as if it were serious and as if a person who wanted the product for certain uses could get a permit upon -- and pay a $100 tax and you're asking us to say that Congress was just fooling in what it really -- and what this really is, is a statute that prohibits the use of marijuana except of the dollar an ounce purposes?</text>

            <text syncTime="333.365" offset="1436818">Well, I think, Mr. Justice, what we are asking the Court to do is to look at the statute in terms of the realities.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.095" offset="1471718">And I think if you look at the record before Congress which included testimony from Mr. Hester who has been referred to previously and others that at the time this tax was enacted, marijuana was selling in the illicit market at $1 an ounce.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.450" offset="1537128">Congress imposed the $100 an ounce tax, clearly prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.226" offset="1560325">I think the fact --</text>

            <text syncTime="371.797" offset="1590523">In other words, you say that because the tax here is such a great amount on the $100 users that we are to look at it as if Congress, instead of going through the ritual of the taxing machinery and prohibited the- transfer, possession or transportation of marijuana except for the dollar an ounce purposes?</text>

            <text syncTime="400.267" offset="1704417">And that so construed, you say that this is different from Marchetti and the Grosso because in Marchetti and Grosso anybody could apply and there was no distinction in the amount of the tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="484.060" offset="2039620">In Haynes, we're dealing only with one particular requirement of the Act which clearly required people to register if they had a firearm of the type described in that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.986" offset="2091342">Here, however, I think that it's important to note that all of the disclosure requirements are directed basically at the legal industry, the legal marijuana industry so that legal use of marijuana would be made public and that the law enforcement officials could see that the legal marijuana was not diverted -into illegal channels.</text>

            <text syncTime="538.657" offset="2258004">Well, I think there was -- the only reason they didn't enact a totally prohibitive statute insofar as illegal transactions were concerned, there was a legal market for this so they couldn't totally prohibit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.975" offset="2307323">But insofar as the illegal market was concerned, the reason they chose to use the prohibitive tax form was I think because at the time Congress was concerned with the five, four decision of this case and the 63 decision in Nigro and Doremus and they were afraid, unless the prohibitive section was not put in terms of that prohibitive tax, there might be some constitutional problems with that.</text>

            <text syncTime="668.238" offset="2776273">That the effect of it was to make it a prohibitive tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.890" offset="2790902">Therefore, this Court talked in Grosso and Marchetti of the fact that the claim of the Fifth Amendment has to be real and appreciable.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.016" offset="2819427">So we submit here that the Court has to look at the whole statutory scheme in this framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.107" offset="2843773">I think, from that examination, it appears here that the claim of the Fifth Amendment privilege is not real and substantial, but rather a fanciful and imaginary claim which petitioner came up with after the fact in an attempt to excuse his clear violation of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.770" offset="2906467">And, so for that reason we feel that the contention of Fifth Amendment privilege here should be rejected by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="723.342" offset="2996746">I think we do have a lawyer's construction of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.916" offset="3011062">The counsel yesterday said that the Government's construction here was an imaginative one and suggested it was something novel.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.315" offset="3044603">Here is a lawyer looking at the Act and construes it in the same way we did before the issue was ever raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.034" offset="3067486">I think it's somewhat persuasive in that standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.625" offset="3077831">I think two, it goes to the reality of the situation of the fact that this act, everybody recognized, prohibits people who could not handle marijuana legally from doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.575" offset="3129657">The practical effect of it is the total bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.820" offset="3142614">And for that reason, the claim of Fifth Amendment privilege is really a fanciful one which we submit was constructed after the fact and not the true motivating reason that the petitioner did not attempt to comply with the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="782.355" offset="3232789">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.262" offset="3244387">I think that persons have not sort to apply for written order form or to pay the tax because the statute is so blatantly self-incriminatory that it would only be a mad man who would come to the Government and seek to fill out this order form.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.379" offset="3308857">I have read during the course of my argument the testimony of petitioner during the trial, that's at pages 86, 87 and 89 where he specifically said that he feared incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.089" offset="3367685">The part of the motion which the Government has read, I think that they have left out the very point, it was raised on page 651 of the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.172" offset="3416064">The Court erred in not dismissing or granting a judgment of acquittal as to the tax count because such tax requirement violates the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.539" offset="3461517">It was raised at the District Court level.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.830" offset="3474683">The petitioner specifically testified as to his very real fear of the incrimination in the portions that I read yesterday.</text>

            <text syncTime="861.415" offset="3549080">I don't know, Mr. Justice Fortas.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.725" offset="3562245">I think the figure that I used yesterday was one pound yielded 1700 cigarettes; so that's roughly a 100 cigarettes an ounce.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert Haft</label>
            <text syncTime="882.634" offset="3633925">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.283" offset="3648554">That's the -- proper legal tax would be a dollar on the $100 an ounce.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.804" offset="3690559">I think what the Government is in essence asking here is that because Congress perhaps, having doubts about the constitutionality of an outright prohibition and because they wrote on a expressly tax measure rather than a prohibitory measure, if this Court feels that a prohibitory measure is constitutional, this Court ought to go ahead and rewrite the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.522" offset="3789511">That is -is completely the wrong position.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.538" offset="3809573">Going back to the presumption point of yesterday, in answer to Mr. Justice Stewart's question as to other adequate evidence of guilt which there clearly was, I pointed out that under the Court's decision in the United States against Romano, it would be sustained; that my position would be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.014" offset="3891388">In addition, I'd like to point out to the Court that on pages 102 to 104 of the record, in the charge to the jury, the district judge in practical effect limited the entire case to the trip from New York to Texas on the admission of acquisition by the defendant plus the statutory presumption and that's little of the case on the return back.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.577" offset="3993684">I think the charge is very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.526" offset="4001520">It points almost exclusively to that one theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.051" offset="4019597">In the -last minute, I would like to make an application, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.154" offset="4055960">The next case, the Covington case raises just the tax issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.476" offset="4081246">We do feel and counsel for Covington does and the Government does not object, if the Court pleases, we do feel that the bulk of the argument on the taxing statute will come during the Covington argument and counsel for Covington is agreeable for permitting counsel for Leary to have some part of his time in arguing the further parts of the Marijuana Tax Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.168" offset="4176018">It would please the Court, we would like to split the argument to some extent on the Covington case.</text>
