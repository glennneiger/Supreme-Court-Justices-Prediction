            <text syncTime="14.994" offset="163297">This case is here on a Writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and raises the general question of whether federal diversity jurisdiction can be created by a lawful assignment of a contract or a money claim to a plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.891" offset="250964">More specifically, the question is whether the assignment of a contract or a money claim is improper or collusive within the meaning of Section 1359 of the Judicial Code where the assignment itself is legal under state law, where one motive or the assignment is to gain access to the federal court like creating diversity of citizenship specified in Section 1330 (a) (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="76.670" offset="410102">And thirdly, where part of the consideration or the transaction was a percentage of the recovery obtained on the assigned claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="93.275" offset="476453">It's solely a federal question as to whether the court itself has jurisdiction or whether it has lost jurisdiction.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="100.070" offset="503620">Well, is it the meaning of the federal statute?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="104.858" stopTime="262.962">
            <label>Mr. Eugene Gressman</label>
            <text syncTime="104.858" offset="522846">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.143" offset="531937">Now counsel as candidly conceded and the court below and we repeated to this Court while it is not a matter of the record but one of the major motives in the establishment of this transaction was a desire or the to create the basis for invoking the diversity jurisdiction of the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.894" offset="674983">Now that motivation however, has to be viewed in light of the realities of the situation that was confronting the various parties in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.069" offset="739662">Now the brief where the respondent has sought to paint a rather bleak and sinister picture of the events in this case that I suggest are not justified by the record and certainly not by the facts as we know them, there was no senator or secret efforts made to defraud any party or to secrete any documents from the court or from anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.121" offset="883858">What happened in this case of course as we see it is a classic illustration of a desire to avoid what one of these parties the Panama and Venezuela Finance Company viewed as prejudice in the state courts and to avoid that prejudice or possibility of prejudice is really the constitutional raise on debtor of federal diversity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.815" offset="1034637">The major, indeed the sole justification that has ever been suggested for diversity jurisdiction is to permit state causes of action to bid, tried and heard in the federal courts where the parties have any choice in the matter for one reason or another may fear or some degree or some element of prejudice may follow them if they invoke the jurisdiction of the state court rather than the Federal Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="285.390" offset="1244975">Well, I think you have first to look back to the original situation under which this arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.185" offset="1268067">The original situation you will recall was essentially a contract entered into in 1959 between two alien corporations in effect whereby the Caribbean Mills the respondent here agreed to pay over a period of years $165,000.00 to Panama and Venezuela Finance Company which was also an alien corporation having been incorporated in Panama.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.678" offset="1402128">Now, when several years later Caribbean Mills defaulted on that contract and indeed repudiated the contract, Panama Finance Company was faced with a situation out of which this whole transaction arose to with Panama could not have sued Caribbean Mills in the federal court by virtue of the fact that both were aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.174" offset="1508080">Now, the only recourse Panama had to a court action was to sue presumably in Haiti or in the Texas State Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="391.874" offset="1670875">Well then, I should perhaps in the light of what you said change my question a little bit but I still would have a question as to why would the Texas state courts be more prejudice against two foreign corporations than with the federal court be?</text>

            <text syncTime="413.035" offset="1755512">Your Honor this was the practical situation facing them as I say the defendant corporation the Caribbean Mills Corporation while it was technically and legally a citizen of Haiti, an alien was also owned a dominated by the Murchison Family in Dallas, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.707" offset="1838164">Most of the officers of the company resided in Dallas and did -- it actively did corporate business there, Clint Murchison was one of the witnesses in this case testified and frankly they feared that this was more than simply an alien defendant, this was one of the classic instances of where they feared that a -- it would been impossible to overcome the local kind of prejudice that does ensue in these situations where you have a dominant local interest involved on the defendant side.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.746" offset="1994376">Plus the fact that they were a finance companies in addition to being an alien here are notoriously poorer risk as a plaintiff attempting to secure a money judgments.</text>

            <text syncTime="504.264" offset="2120391">But you have a broader selection in the federal court I suppose and you -- not 17 counties I think are involved in the federal court whereas the state court would have been the local precinct or local city anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.948" offset="2175143">But in any event they tried to realize that in their own hands this claim wasn't worth very much and they were actively seeking to sell this claim to a various numbers of persons at a discount.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.144" offset="2227911">I think at one time they tried to sell it for $25,000.00 and nobody would take and they eventually came to Mr. Banner, an attorney in Texas and ask him if he would be interested in purchasing this and he said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.747" offset="2278379">Looking into it he then contacted another attorney, Mr. Kramer the plaintiff in this case and ask if he would be interested in purchasing or arranging to take over this claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.628" offset="2341909">Now, the respondent claims that somehow Mr. Banner was sort of a double agent here acting as an attorney for Panama as well as for Mr. Kramer.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.334" offset="2384750">Far from that he has never acted at anytime as the attorney for Panama has never receive a cent from it and has treated them at arm's-length at all time so that whatever concern or connection Mr. Banner had with the case does not reflect upon Panama's interest or lack of interest in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.271" offset="2472417">In any event when Mr. Kramer became interested in this and purely for profit motives frankly, the problem arose just to, how they could arrange a transaction that would be lawful and that would permit adequate consideration and what have you to be arranged.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.469" offset="2561233">Now, the testimony that Mr. Kramer gave at the trial to be frankly said he didn't have a $165,000.00, he didn't have a hundred thousand dollars to pay for this claim, nor did he have the facilities to obtain a bank loan for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.051" offset="2619538">So after discussing this at some length with his then Attorney Mr. Banner they came to a conclusion that maybe we can have some sort of the deferred type of consideration let's call it a bonus.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.634" offset="2669902">Let's call it anything else to be payable out of whatever you may be able to get from a lawsuit recovered as a result of an assignment of the claim to Mr. Kramer and that is exactly what happened.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eugene Gressman</label>
            <text syncTime="890.731" offset="3666317">The suggestion has been made by the respondent but is completely aside from the facts and not accurate to say that because Mr. Banner who is Mr. Kramer's Attorney was somehow acting on behalf of Panama and all this but that is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.459" offset="3749177">Panama had a lawyer, a firm New York City all times.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.302" offset="3764537">They never got into this litigation of course but they had their separate lawyers and Mr. Banner dealt at arm's-length with that law firm in the execution of these documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.622" offset="3809886">Now it seems to me that it becomes crystal clear that the critical fact therefore in this case is that the assignment itself was absolute, complete, and bona fide and indeed there's no dispute about that as I see it that all of Panama's interest were thereby transferred and as a result of the assignment instrument, Panama had no claim, no right under that contract, no cause of action, no control over the lawsuit that ensued and concededly this was proper under the applicable law of Texas and that the law of any other state in the United States to effectuate a complete transfer of all of Panama's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.997" offset="4015313">Now, the Court of Appeals read however, the collateral agreement provision of the 95% bonus as indicated that somehow Panama retained some sort of a beneficial interest to our in this cause of action or in the contract claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.024" offset="4103502">Now, while this was conceded by the parties as a legitimate forum or deferred consideration, it is I suppose possible to read this as some sort of a beneficial interest of one sort of another or perhaps an assignment or collection on behalf of Panama.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.079" offset="4199737">But the worst or the least can be said about this transaction with respect to the 95% interest which was to be returned to Panama was that this was an assignment or collection which is one of the most common transactions lawful transactions that is performed almost everyday in the business world which gives the assignee complete control, complete domination, complete title of whatever is assigned to him for collection and makes the assignee the real per diem interest to bring the suit and despite the fact that he is suppose to return part of that recovery or all of the recovery even in some cases back to the assignor, it does not make the assignment itself any less complete, any less lawful and is certainly does not make the transaction itself collusive under any recognized meaning of those phrases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.375" offset="4488861">It is well-established in the law that an assignment that shows an action constitutes the assignee, the proper party an interest to sue even though the instrument of assignment recites, which this one did not, that the transfer is merely for purposes of suit and obligates the assignee to account for the proceeds to another person and indeed this Court's decision in Titus versus Wallick in 306 volume of the United States reports at 282, is the leading authority on the validity of this kind of an arrangement and the Court there said that under the, it happen to be in New York transaction there that the repeated decisions of New York and it could be said of any other state, it is long been settled that an assignment which purports to assign or transfer or shows of action confers upon the transferee such title and ownership as will enable him to sue upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.121" offset="4759907">This is true even though the assignment is for the purpose of suit only and the transferee is obligated to account for the proceeds of the suit to his assignor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.384" offset="4796897">And more importantly, and this was the opinion written by Justice Stone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.043" offset="4815496">It is evident that through to this kind of a transaction no fraud was perpetrated upon the other party or upon the New York courts if the assignment of the claim operated to this in the assignee, such ownership or interest in the claim was it would enable him to maintain the suit upon it there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1200.692" offset="4906088">No that -- well not truly a diversity case in that sense but it was a full faith in credit they had made a -- the assignee had obtained a judgment in New York, which was subsequently attack in Ohio as being fraudulently obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.394" offset="4984978">And this Court says, âNot at all that there had been no fraud perpetrated by virtue of making an assignment for collection only and that this was a perfectly legitimate and lawful transaction.â</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.935" offset="5047150">Now we have to therefore apply the language of 259 to this arraignment which I have described.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.460" offset="5093230">And I think it's very instructive to note that 1359 of course was created as a part of the 1948 revision of the judicial code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.562" offset="5141608">And prior to 1948 we had on the books from the beginning of our statutes as a matter in 1789.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.071" offset="5179643">The so-called anti-assignment statute which was very simple in its concept and that was that if the original parties doing the transaction did not have adequate diversity or did it, were unable to bring suit in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.670" offset="5254040">You could not by assignment create any different result in other words the assignee was absolutely bound by the jurisdictional situation created by the original parties and you could not change that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.710" offset="5318196">That became incrusted with a lot of exceptions and a legislative jargon which made it and also barred the good assignments and the bad assignments as long as the original parties couldn't sue and the assignee could never bring an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.682" offset="5378069">So they decided to eliminate that provision completely and to adopt rather the concept developed under the 1875 statute have bind any kind of a transfer or device which would collusively or improperly make as a party plaintiff any individual where the intent was to create or invoke federal court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.939" offset="5519130">And the revisers of the Judicial Code made it very plain that they were cutting down on the assignment scope of the -- what you might call the anti-assignment statute by confining its application to cases wherein the assignment is improperly or collusively made to invoke jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.093" offset="5635741">And they made it clear that there was no dispute about this that the revisers meant to apply the long established principles of the 1875 statute to assignments and what are those principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.711" offset="5690180">Well, the first place it's clear that not all assignments and not all transfers designed to evoke diversity jurisdiction are outlawed nor do they divest the federal court of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.878" offset="5742843">Only those that result from a collusive or improper action in establishing the party plaintiff, many people including many commentators seemed to think that in 1359 bars all assignments that create diversity jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1886.507" offset="7649364">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.001" offset="7663365">To restate the facts of somewhat greater length, in the summer of 1964 there were two lawyers in Wichita Falls, Texas, one was Mr. Jack Banner, one was Mr. Clayton Kramer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.579" offset="7729716">Mr. Banner according to the record was briefing a legal point in connection with a contract that contract was the contract between Panama and Venezuela Finance Company and Caribbean Mills, Inc. both of those are alien corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.107" offset="7803800">Neither of them could have sued the other in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.209" offset="7820204">The contract under Panama's view of it was already two years in default.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.275" offset="7844446">There were annual installment payments an under Panama's view three annual installment payments have already gone by without payment having been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.504" offset="7889377">One day, Mr. Kramer and Mr. Banner met as they had many times in the past and Mr. Banner said to Mr. Kramer that there was a claim which might be acquired obviously Mr. Banner must have gotten the claim from somewhere and that conversation which is in the record evidently indicates an authority on Mr. Banner's part to offer the claim to Mr. Kramer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.617" offset="8013824">Well, one thing led to another Mr. Kramer by the way knew nothing about the claim, he was a perfect stranger to the transaction, didn't know any of the parties involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.755" offset="8062412">Somewhere in the shuffle, Mr. Banner became Mr. Kramer's lawyer and the parties sat down and they prepared not one but two legal documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.435" offset="8117164">One of them was an assignment of claim which assignment did not refer to the second document.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.749" offset="8154363">The assignment reflected that the consideration was $1.00 and other good and valuable considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.044" offset="8195532">The record is clear that the only money that change hands was the $1.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.855" offset="8218833">The other agreement is the agreement which the petitioner calls the collateral agreement for which we called the side agreement but actually the two words means the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.711" offset="8266167">And in that agreement which unlike the first agreement referred to the other document, in that agreement there was covenant on the part of Mr. Kramer to prosecute the claim to final judgment and there was a promise on Mr. Kramer's part to pay 95% of the net recovery on the claim back to the assignor, Panama.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.553" offset="8401586">Now, even though Mr. Kramer in his somewhat difficult testimony in the transcript never admitted that the motive for this transaction was to create federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.447" offset="8461145">Counsel has admitted various times that the motive and another times a motive was to create federal jurisdiction and the record suggests no other motive brought by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.747" offset="8518405">The parties then, Mr. Kramer and Mr. Banner entered into a contingent fee agreement the side agreement that Mr. Kramer in Panama had entered into permitted Mr. Kramer to enter into contingent fee agreements up to 33 of the 30% and that sort of arrangement was in fact entered into Mr. Banner's firm and six weeks later, there was a suit filed in Kramer's name in the federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2225.812" offset="9006582">But even if this was openly done that this amounts to under the teachings of the cases in this Court to an improper and collusive assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.417" offset="9049004">The complaint was then filed in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.559" offset="9065618">The complaint alleged that Panama had assigned, sold, and delivered its entire interest and rights in the agreement to Clayton S. Kramer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.648" offset="9109922">It didn't say a word about the fact that Panama has a beneficial interest in 95% of the net recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.127" offset="9155897">Not unexpectedly the defense of the lawsuit wondered somewhat is to how this claim turned up in the hands of the lawyer from Wichita Falls and Mr. Kramer's deposition was taken and he was asked on deposition series of questions which are in the record as to how he came to be the owner of the claim and he declined to answer all those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.048" offset="9255581">He declined to answer questions as to the existence of agreements between him and Panama apart from the face of the assignment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2318.134" offset="9375953">The central question in this case is whether Section 1359 of the Judicial Code bars the manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.757" offset="9414405">The manufacture then said religiously, the petitioners were not ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.608" offset="9429765">It bars the manufacturer of the diversity jurisdiction of the case like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.879" offset="9454843">This report held no that the only relevant consideration was to look to the face of the assignment and not to look to the other factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.612" offset="9497788">The Court of Appeals said yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.243" offset="9512312">The essentials as we see it of the arrangement or scheme that was employed here are four in number.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.020" offset="9559437">You of course start with two parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.717" offset="9566229">It could not sue each other in the federal court, sometimes two aliens, sometimes its two citizens of the same state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.790" offset="9594546">And the four factors as we see them or first that you have a voluntarily assignment of the claim, this is not a case involving an executor or a guardian where you have to have fiduciary in order to prosecute a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.933" offset="9659120">This is a voluntarily assignment of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.282" offset="9676466">It's an assignment made after the dispute arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.147" offset="9687960">Here, there were three annual payments which allegedly under the plaintiff's theory were in default.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.510" offset="9717426">The third factor is that a motive is to create or manufacture diversity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.473" offset="9753266">And the fourth factor is the assign -- that the assignor retains a beneficial ownership in the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.695" offset="9798196">Now, in 1875 when the diversity of citizenship, the jurisdiction of the federal courts was enlarged there was enacted by Congress a protective statute which provided in substantially the same language as present Section 1359 that the federal courts would not have jurisdiction where a party was made or added through assignment or otherwise, improperly or collusively in order to create federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.864" offset="9958797">And in the 35 years after that statute was passed, there was a whole string of cases, which came before this Court which involved these four elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.540" offset="10001533">They involved the assignment, the assignment made after the dispute arose, the motive to create federal jurisdiction, and the retention of the beneficial interest in the claim by the assignor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.409" offset="10073004">That last is of course an important factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.945" offset="10087111">There are another line of cases uphold that where the assignment is in fact absolute where a party buys a claim, pays money for it, and the assignor has no further interest in the outcome of a litigation that you may then look at the assignee's citizenship for the purpose of determining diversity jurisdiction but this case is not on that side of the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.371" offset="10200900">Mr. Kramer here had been willing to make an evaluation of the claim, pay money for it and in effect be quits with Panama and leave Panama with no interest whatsoever in this claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.852" offset="10258787">The case has seem to teach that that sort of assignment is not improper or collusive but this line of cases which we review at pages 14 to 18 of our brief, which were decided in the years immediately after the passage of this statute hold that where the assignor has retained the beneficial interest in the claim and the beneficial interest in these cases vary some cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.724" offset="10362232">It's a 100% other cases it was a less than a 100% and the assignee like Mr. Kramer here was given a percentage for the use of his name.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.808" offset="10406640">But these cases hold that that constitutes an improper or collusive assignment and they used the words improper or collusive and applied this concept of collusion to this arrangement between at least two parties even though these are not two parties on different sides of the lawsuits.</text>
