            <text syncTime="1500.021" offset="6104461">Well then we come in to the Redrup case which was decided since Roth and this Court last year in Redrup and the other cases that went with it reversed on the theory and on the principle, that there had been -- that this was not a case involving one of the three elements, either distribution to minors, distribution to persons who are unwilling to see it, or pandering as was held in Ginsberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.361" offset="6189829">Now, if we accept Redrup as being the law, then of course we must take Redrup and Roth together as they both hold and say that obscenity insofar as it's mere possession and bare possession, to use that expression, the bare possession is concerned, would be protected by the First Amendment, because there you are not intruding upon the privacy or the rights of others to be free from this stuff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.143" offset="6304977">Now, in the finding -- one thing I would like to answer my opponent with respect to, he says that the state court found that the state statute did not remove the element of scienter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.974" offset="6368298">Now, the rule as I understand it is that this Court will accept an interpretation placed upon a state court as to a non-federal ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.166" offset="6409049">But as to a federal constitutional ground, this Court is not precluded by virtue of a holding of a state court on a constitutional issue from reversing that state court because this is the final arbiter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.633" offset="6458890">This court is the one that must decide the federal ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.453" offset="6474250">Now, secondly, in the brief of the appellee on page 45, he cites the case of Rainwater versus Florida which was decided by this Court during the last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.945" offset="6516151">The Rainwater versus Florida case was one that originated in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.547" offset="6538616">There was a federal search warrant issued under the Wagering Tax Act (Inaudible) certain items from the defendant's possession and they prosecuted them in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.384" offset="6573934">This Court remanded that under the theory of Grosso and Marchetti, remanded it back to the state court for further proceedings not inconsistent with Grosso and Marchetti.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.766" offset="6615416">This is identical to the case we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.702" offset="6627224">The state says in its brief that there the prosecution, the state court, was the end-result of the issuance of the federal search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.366" offset="6653868">That's what we have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.841" offset="6659720">This prosecution for obscenity was the end-result of the issuance of the federal search warrant which actually under the Rainwater versus Florida doctrine was inadmissible as having been unconstitutionally obtained.</text>

            <text syncTime="1725.121" offset="7004850">He says that the evidence in the case indicated that one reel of film had been wound backwards or was scratched and that that would indicate that someone had previously viewed that film.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.183" offset="7053124">But it would not show and we submit to this Court that that fact alone could not and would not show that this defendant or this appellant had ever viewed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.858" offset="7091785">Now, in conclusion, I would like to state that since my opponent has -- or my adversary has suggested to this Court that this Court view the film, he has in effect stated that that how does this Court know that they are obscene without viewing them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.167" offset="7165032">Now, that is our very position in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1771.585" offset="7190737">If he has never viewed the films, he would not obviously know that they're obscene because without viewing them, you cannot learn of its obscenity and that is the point that we have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.435" offset="7234100">We say that since the evidence doesn't show that he ever viewed the films that therefore there's no evidence that he knew, or could have known that they were obscene.</text>
