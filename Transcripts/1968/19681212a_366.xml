            <text syncTime="939.975" offset="3863280">This Court upheld as a legitimate exercise of the tax power, the absolute band provided in the Harrison Act for transfers to non-registrants even though there is no tax even on the transfer of narcotics under the Harrison Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.750" offset="3930363">They said, “It was enough to say that these prohibitions were designed to keep the transfers above board where the commodity tax was subject to collection.”</text>

            <label>Justice Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="982.324" offset="4032658">To make it clearer that this was a legitimate exercise of the tax power, they impose to transfer tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.597" offset="4069752">The legislative history is clear on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.425" offset="4077066">This is why they thought there would be absolutely no constitutional problem under the tax power because these transactions are subject to the taxing power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.641" offset="4113951">They are subject to a tax and it was thought obvious that Congress in its exercise to the tax power can legitimately distinguish between types of taxable transactions and make determinations as to how the transactions must be carried on if at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.329" offset="4196707">But I would like to say that as the legislative history does relate because in the House Committee Report were, this was actually as the revenue bill originated in the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.648" offset="4237981">It was expressly stated that insofar as the tax power might be argued not to support a complete prohibition such as was being enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.982" offset="4283329">The report states it is clear that the commerce power and the other powers of Congress for instance a power over the District of Columbia and the territories would also support this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.839" offset="4326693">I might point out that we have today even a further support for a complete prohibition such as this and I think it standard constitutional doctrine that even if Congress misapprehends the power that it's relying and a statute is not ultra vires if there is some constitutional support even if it's not the clause that Congress relied on to sustain statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.403" offset="4432959">The United States is now a party to an international convention enforced with some 67 other states -- nation states which expressly obliges the United States to impose the maximum controls on heroin, opium, and marihuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.511" offset="4505370">We think that the interplay of all of these constitutional clauses is more than adequate authority to sustain the absolute prohibition on illicit transfers that Congress has enacted and the administrators have implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.322" offset="4568691">There was also a claim made that this is a noble contention because it's inconsistent with what this -- with the Government has advised the Court or Congress in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.879" offset="4614875">A petitioner in the Leary case cited our Sanchez brief which was the case in which the Court sustained the constitutionality of the $100.00 per ounce transfer tax in a civil assessment proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.788" offset="4670568">Nothing that we said in Sanchez it's in any way inconsistent with what we say here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.426" offset="4693034">The two sentences quoted in the reply brief upon behalf of petitioner in Leary are in the course of a discussion in which we said Congress went beyond what it had done in the Harrison Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.734" offset="4758340">And the Harrison Act, it had simply enacted a direct prohibition unrelated to the tax power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.050" offset="4779551">In this Act, the Marihuana Act, we said in Sanchez and the Court ultimately agreed that it was constitutional to do it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.152" offset="4811943">Congress didn't fashion a direct prohibition without more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.453" offset="4829184">It went beyond this and as we said in the language which I believe is quoted in their brief -- reply brief, Congress did more in addition to achieve in that same effect it also provided that there would revenue raised through the course of transferring marihuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.375" offset="4900864">And for that reason as I suggested before, the controls that were imposed on the transfer of marihuana we thought to be valid a fortiori from those that have been sustained albeit by divided courts in Doremus and Alston, Webb, Wong Sing, and Nigro.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.620" offset="4989889">The same thing is true with respect to the memorandum by the treasury in relating to the Guam Organic Act all that recognize.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.064" offset="5023640">I think that's quoted in the amicus brief filed on behalf for the American Civil Liberties Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.718" offset="5050284">That memorandum reflects that the Marihuana Tax Act is not a complete prohibition on the transfer of marihuana as it is not because there are still lawful uses for marihuana at least in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.685" offset="5098141">It is still possible to deal in marihuana lawfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.000" offset="5111411">The treasury memorandum said, “There are no lawfully uses for marihuana in Guam,” there isn't any research being conducted, it's not grown for hand purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.701" offset="5146206">So, rather than preserved the possibility of some legitimate dealings in marihuana in Guam where it's unnecessary, we will substitute for it a direct categorical prohibition so that no one in Guam can lawfully deal in marihuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.237" offset="5208273">In the United States, that is not true and in fact there are approximately 90 federal registrants who having complied with state requirements for handling marihuana are eligible to register under the Federal Act and can lawfully transfer marihuana upon payment of the $1.00 an ounce transfer tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.521" offset="5301478">The essence of all of this is that as the Act was drafted with the clear objective of stamping out transfers to illegitimate addict and as the administrative agencies had consistently administered the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.451" offset="5365217">There is no real problem of incrimination because those whose obtaining of marihuana would violate state law are not expected to come forward to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.232" offset="5408266">They're not allowed to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.080" offset="5415685">They're not expected to come forward to obtain order forms or to prepay the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.794" offset="5434598">They will not be allowed to do this because Congress was not unlike the firearms case and unlike the wagering cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.763" offset="5466467">Congress was not willing to provide federal sanction for this type of conduct with the intent of exposing it to prosecution under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.283" offset="5500531">The federal and state provisions in this area are in complete tandem only lawful dealers under state law can comply with the Federal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.997" offset="5543372">Anyone who can't comply with state law cannot comply with the Federal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.158" offset="5559986">So, we have federal enforcement power to reinforce as a matter of federal law the ban on the transfer of marihuana for smoking or addiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.689" offset="5602095">We suggest this is radically different from the wagering and firearms cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.972" offset="5623306">And that the reason that people don't comply with this statute is not there's any fear of incrimination, it is because they're not eligible to comply because there is a prohibitive tax that is imposed and a tax which Congress did not contemplate could be paid before the transaction took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.559" offset="5709615">I would like to save any remaining time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1436.776" offset="5850467">First, I want to apologize to the clerk's office and the Court for any problems arising in the -- my presentation of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.818" offset="5898637">Probable cause was noted in October of 1968 and I was at that time notified that because of the Leary case was coming up at the same time it was desirable that this case be argued at the same time and I was asked if I could meet the deadline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.894" offset="5978990">I was reluctant to try to meet the deadline because I am somewhat of anachronism I run a one-man law office and I -- however, felt the importance of this case and I took, almost took on more than like two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.140" offset="6047953">I – we manage -- did manage to get in a brief and it is a brief, brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.666" offset="6070000">I do not apologize for the brevity of the brief but I do apologize for the small print because like my Texas colleague yesterday I'd like to say that the brief only cost about $1.10 a copy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.728" offset="6118275">So, we did save some money but it might have to be use with microscope in order to read, the print it is so small.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.890" offset="6154951">It is my hope that I can amend for this in my oral presentation of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.194" offset="6184103">Now, the Covington case which is before you delineates the very shocking the question of the tax because as the Government admits and I was of course counsel below as the Government admits, we interpose our objection to the statute in the time of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.573" offset="6285667">My client was indicted on or about August well in September of 1967 or sometime thereafter and the indictment read as follows, “United States of America versus Henry Preston Covington that on or about August 11, 1967 within the Eastern District of the Southern District of Ohio, Henry Preston Covington being a transferee of marihuana required to pay the tax imposed by Title 26, United States Code Section 4741 (a) did acquire and obtain approximately 737.1 grams of marihuana without having paid such tax period in violation of 26 United States Code 4744 (a) (1).”</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.130" offset="6511888">To this indictment, we interpose a motion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that the statute compel -- would compel the defendant to incriminate himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.882" offset="6578866">We had -- this was not accidental that we raise this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.049" offset="6591613">We have been following the Costello case as in the gambling cases in the Advance Sheets and we were waiting for the decisions to be reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.407" offset="6641037">Unfortunately for us, the decisions were reached before the indict -- before we had to answer the indictment and when the, not only because when the cases came out, Haynes, Marchetti, and Grosso and the same volume of the law editions we relied on these cases to meet this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.862" offset="6738840">So, to answer to Mr. Justice Stewart's question of yesterday as to the time of the case, our case did come after Haynes, Marchetti and Grosso so that would be no problem of retroactivity if the Court desire to follow its decisions in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.279" offset="6832462">Of course, one of the things that impelled us to make the objection to the statute and I think one of the things that influenced the federal judge, Judge Joseph P. Kinneary in sustaining our motion was the dissent of the Chief Justice in the Grosso case in which he said that, “I apprehended the Court by a necessarily sweeping within its constitutional requirements, the registration requirements within its constitutional holding the registration requirements of 4412 is opening a door to a new waive of a tax on a number of federal registration statutes wherever the registration requirement touches upon allegedly illegal activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.407" offset="7025037">And of course the 4722, those engaged in dealing in narcotic drugs 4753, those who deal in marihuana were included in the Chief Justice's enumeration of the statutes which might be affected by this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.373" offset="7088880">We realize of course that Chief Justice which this time was concerned about the effect that these decisions had on the power to tax and we of course would share that concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.214" offset="7140185">However, it's no question about that these decisions did open the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.204" offset="7160142">And we're trying to get in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.503" offset="7177383">Might I say that insofar as civil liability is concerned and I might say this reference to the questions that have been asked by Mr. Justice Fortas and Mr. Justice Stewart, the -- I'm sorry, White.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.011" offset="7283440">This law is no joke to my client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.058" offset="7303607">My client was served a notice by a narcotic agent and the notice was directed to him to Henry Preston Covington and it says this is from a narcotic agent Jack Elloy in Ohio in case in Ohio 782M which is either his narcotic case file number or the Internal Revenue file number.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.994" offset="7407365">“It has been reported to the undersigned officially that on or about 11 day of August 1967 at Columbus Ohio and Eastern Division, Southern District of Ohio you were found with a quantity of marihuana in your possession and under your control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.924" offset="7467029">Accordingly, and in pursuant to the provisions of Section 4744, the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, I hereby demand that within eight days from the service hereof upon you, you produce at my office in room 1045 in the Federal Office building Cleveland, Ohio a copy of the official order form” that's in caps “required by Section 4742 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to be retained by you under and by virtue of which said marihuana was transferred to and applied by you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.143" offset="7623973">You are further notified that your failure to comply herewith within the period specified will render you liable for the transfer of taxes imposed by Section 4741 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and will establish presumptively that you acquired and obtained said marihuana unlawfully without having paid such taxes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.059" offset="7715610">So, contrary to the Government's argument that this is a lot of more lucky, these people are following this statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2059.690" offset="8342131">I -- we, -- the case below was decided on memorandum solely and I do not recall a civil liability being raised in the memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.289" offset="8392495">It was the memorandum below of the government was primarily on this question of the administrative construction of this Act to the effect that no person who was illegally engaged in the transfer of marihuana could obtain an order form but there was no question of civil liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.012" offset="8467414">Of course, these are things outside the record, In addition, my client's car was impounded 66, 65 Buick.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.387" offset="8508897">So, it's very real, this man is very real that him and because the impounding of the car was not under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.364" offset="8536795">So, it's a very real to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.142" offset="8543901">Now, we feel therefore that we are strictly following judicial precedent and we feel the Court -- the lower court, District Court took a forthright stand and we feel that Haynes, Grosso, and Marchetti required that the striking down of the statutory scheme such as this which constructs a federal crime upon failure to make a compelled disclosure of activity clearly criminal and even though it's in a tax or in a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.158" offset="8696038">We -- we note that the Haynes, Grosso, Marchetti decisions merely extended the Albertson decision which struck down a registration oriented criminal statute which the two purpose was to direct it to a selective group inherently suspect of criminal activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.485" offset="8789347">Again, we emphasize the fact that our case came after the Haynes, Grosso and Marchetti case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.775" offset="8814425">I might also indicate one of the statements that was made by a federal judge below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.235" offset="8868342">After the judge had struck down the statute and construed the statute to be unconstitutional as applied to this defendant, Covington, the Government again asked for reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.381" offset="8936887">And on reconsideration, it emphasizes argument that this man could've obtained the narcotic and therefore the tax doesn't apply to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.218" offset="8980250">The court below rule made an alternative ruling in addition to ruling that that the statute compelled self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.243" offset="9028315">The court answered the Government's argument in the following manner and he said, “The memorandum filed in support of this motion submits that a person who is a transferee of marihuana in violation of state laws will not be issued an order form for marihuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.183" offset="9104071">It is asserted this reads the statute of any trace of unconstitutionality.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.627" offset="9125909">This Court did not decide that the marihuana taxing provision are in themselves unconstitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.462" offset="9153181">It merely determined that as applied to this defendant, they would be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.560" offset="9177631">If the defendant had no obligation to pay the tax and obtain an order form, the United States had no basis on which to seek an indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.522" offset="9213471">The Court does not agree that Section 4744, the statute under which this defendant was indicted is now an absolute prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.532" offset="9249520">Section 4744 is based explicitly on Section 4741 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.717" offset="9274284">If 4741 (a) is not applicable to the defendant, then there is no basis for the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.498" offset="9309393">Therefore, in any event the indictment should be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.126" offset="9319842">We feel that this is a commendable construction of the answer to the Government's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.042" offset="9351502">And we feel that it is too late now for laws to be change by administrative fiat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.348" offset="9392776">Normally, the administrator is trying to read more things into the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.127" offset="9415868">Here, in this case, the Government is trying to read something out of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.802" offset="9434572">This law says, “all persons” and we feel therefore that this law compels incrimination insofar as Covington was concerned and that as to him it was an unconstitutional attempt to compel him to incriminate himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.936" offset="9523075">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="2365.011" offset="9563408">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.438" offset="9581171">Counsel for the Government has relied upon the regulation as something it has -- is in support of the consistent administrative of construction since 1937 that the Government does not accept the $100.00 tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.769" offset="9642402">Now, the regulations are part of the Government's brief in the Leary matter and I believe in Covington as well starting on page 58.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.092" offset="9675734">These regulations states starting with the first one, the tax applies to every transfer and that's put in the regulation since 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.558" offset="9717635">Amount of tax where they transfers to a taxable person who was duly registered and paid the special tax, the transfer tax is at the rate of a dollar per ounce of fraction thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.259" offset="9760371">If the transfers to be to a person was not registered and paid the special tax under this Act, tax at the rate of $100.00 per ounce of fraction thereof is due.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.774" offset="9802480">That's in the 19 -- regulation since 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.322" offset="9820662">On page 59 of the Government's appendix, this is 59 of their brief, again in the regulations it states that on the order form the application shall show that transferee's name, address, and if registered, the registration number so that the order form regulation since 1937 has contemplated a non-registrant applying for an order form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.220" offset="9940302">Now, what is there in the regulations of the Government does rely on?</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.339" offset="9956707">They rely on the signature and comparison regulations, the only thing and either the statute, the legislative history or any place that says anything about a registration is tied in with the order form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.386" offset="10020968">Now, in the signature and comparison regulations, it does state that the Internal Revenue District is to take an application for an order form and compare the signature on that application with the list of registrant's signatures which are on file.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.039" offset="10095574">That is those that paid their occupational tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.051" offset="10107591">Now, that's all the Government can hang their head on and I think that that is easily explained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.889" offset="10130892">That is if you want to commend with an application for an order form and pay a dollar an ounce tax, the way that you prove that all you have to pay is a dollar an ounce is by signing and showing that you are a registrant to what comparing it to your signature on file and that is consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.799" offset="10206542">Those regulations with the dollar an ounce tax claim and if the comparison does not show up in the Internal Revenue District, you got to pay the $100.00 an ounce tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.861" offset="10246771">That's all and is in this so-called 1937 to date consistent construction by the Government and plenty against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.441" offset="10289089">In connection with this rather subtle point that you can't prepay the tax and that all and unlawful possess it can do is post pay the tax and go to jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.686" offset="10334124">I mean that's really what the Government is saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.456" offset="10345200">The statutes themselves expressly provide to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.937" offset="10363068">The 4741 which imposes the tax in subdivision (b) and (a) imposes the rate a dollar and $100.00 and in (b) by whom pay such tax and now without any distinction between the dollar and a hundred search tax shall be paid by the transferee at that time of securing each order form and shall be in addition to the price of the form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.546" offset="10469543">It's very clear that tax payment both the dollar and a hundred is contemplated at the time you go to the Secretary of that Treasury and get you order form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.731" offset="10510294">The order form again, it sometime pays to look at the plain statute in what it says in light of the sophisticated argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.419" offset="10545089">The order form requirement 4742 says, “It shall be unlawful for any person whether or not required to pay a special tax and to register to transfer marihuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.145" offset="10603917">And the tax is -- the $100.00 tax is upon each transfer to any person who has not paid the special tax and register.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.347" offset="10644773">It's all embracing, the statute says, it is to be paid at the time you get your order form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.668" offset="10670059">The order form speaks prospectively in subsection (c) of the order form requirement 4742.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.282" offset="10704541">It talks about the name and address of the proposed vendor and proposed vendee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.254" offset="10728364">So that you are suppose to legitimatize your transaction beforehand by paying your tax and securing your order form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.824" offset="10758666">This is on the face of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.916" offset="10767026">The regulation's reiterate this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.985" offset="10783326">The crime, it is interesting is in 4744 and it says, “It's unlawful for any person who is a transferee required to pay the transfer tax imposed by 4741 to acquire marihuana without having paid such tax.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.865" offset="10866813">Again, very clear that the tax is to be paid prior to the transaction and it's expressly contemplated by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.160" offset="10916028">I thank the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2833.586" offset="11437746">Counsel for Mr. Leary has just said that the only thing we have is a statement in the regulations at the signatures on the application for registration.</text>

            <text syncTime="2881.637" offset="11629902">It then says unless the district director is satisfied that the application is authentic, it will not be honored.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.363" offset="11664802">Now, we can see no other reasonable construction of this regulation and that the signature is the authentic signature of the registrant.</text>
