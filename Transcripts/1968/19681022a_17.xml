            <text syncTime="53.030" offset="315538">This is an income tax case dealing with the construction or portion of the accumulated earnings tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.934" offset="343124">The purpose of this tax, the accumulated earnings tax, which has been a part of our tax fabrics since 1913, is to deter shareholders of a corporation from avoiding individual income tax by having the corporation accumulate earnings beyond the reasonable needs of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.033" offset="423476">The Government's petition for a writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the Sixth Circuit in this case takes place because the Sixth Circuit's decision was in conflict with four other circuits, circuits that are in support of the United States in its construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.972" offset="487215">The surplus earnings tax deals with Sections 531 through 537 of the Internal Revenue Code and they have three essential features.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.979" offset="527339">Section 532 (a) of the Code has the critical operative provision in the context of the accumulated earnings tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.698" offset="570180">This is the provision that imposes the special tax on “every corporation formed or availed of for the purpose of avoiding the income tax with respect to its shareholders by permitting earnings and profits to accumulate instead of being divided or distributed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="135.084" offset="643741">This feature requires a particular showing of conduct and a particular showing of a state of mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.965" offset="675192">Questions of intent and state of mind however are difficult and since 1913, the statute has carried with it a rebuttable presumption regarding the prohibited purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.233" offset="720332">Section 533 (a) of the Code carries the prohibited -- carries this presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.204" offset="744155">It provides that the fact that earnings and profits are permitted to accumulate beyond the reasonable needs of the business shall be determinative of the purpose to avoid the income tax with respect to shareholders unless the corporation by the preponderance of the evidence shall prove to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.693" offset="822105">Finally, since 1954, there has been a credit provision within the accumulated earnings tax and this is found at 535 (c), the most significant of the two credits, the 535 (c) (1) credit which in essence permits a credit notwithstanding the presence of this proscribed purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.175" offset="900054">As to that portion of the accumulated earnings that if determined by the trier of fact to be reasonable, although the ultimate issue is whether or not there's a proscribed purpose, whether or not it exists, even if it's found to exist, the credit under 535 (c) (1) would wash out the tax at least as to that portion of the accumulation --</text>

            <text syncTime="260.382" offset="1144874">The credit in 1954 allowed the taxpayer to at least take out of the ambit of a tax that portion which was determined to be reasonable at all times assuming that the avoidance purpose existed.</text>

            <text syncTime="302.314" offset="1312580">As the net result of the '54 credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.343" offset="1332746">To summarize, the special tax will imposed if the purpose of avoiding the shareholder tax is found to exists either because of the presumption in 533 (a) or if it's found independently of it but subject to the credit for so much of the retained earnings as reasonably needed for the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.001" offset="1411427">Now, the present case takes the form of a suit for refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.209" offset="1424175">At the trial, the jury heard that evidence that for the years 1960 and 1961, the respondent, a bubblegum manufacturer had increased the accumulated earnings in those years in suit from approximately 1,638,000 to 1,679,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.953" offset="1503169">There was no record of any dividends ever being paid in the years in suit or any indication of dividends having been paid since the inception of a corporation on 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.961" offset="1543189">The sole stockholder testified that the reasons for the accumulations were to purchase the stock of respondent's major distributor.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.195" offset="1576103">There was also a testimony that the accumulations were because of a fear of depression, possible fear of war and also a desire on the part of the respondent to follow by expansion the footsteps of the Wrigley Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.809" offset="1634617">Now, in response to interrogatories, the jury found: one, that during the years in suit, the respondent had accumulated its earnings beyond the reasonable or reasonably anticipated needs of a business but that it had not retained its earnings for the purpose of avoiding the income on its sole shareholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.889" offset="1714970">The Government's appeal was based on the District Court's refusal to define the phrase “the purpose” as it relates to the reason for the retention of the earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.856" offset="1754781">The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case for a new trial holding that the jury might well have been led to believe that tax avoidance must be the sole purpose behind an accumulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.259" offset="1800443">Now, this position, the tax avoidance must be the sole purpose and not been asserted by either of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.719" offset="1830222">The Sixth Circuit in reaching this decision rejected the Government's position, the Government's request for a jury instruction that tax avoidance need only be one of the purposes for the company's accumulation policy and the Sixth Circuit went on to hold that the jury should be instructed that the accumulated earnings tax applies only if tax avoidance was the dominant, controlling or impelling motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.697" offset="1938160">The Government seeks to review in this Court because we believe that this dominant purpose standard is erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.735" offset="1966268">We believe that the proper view was the view that was requested of the District Court, that tax avoidance need only be one of the purposes of an accumulation for the special tax to come into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.605" offset="2013811">The basic purpose of Sections 531 through 537 is to discourage the use of a corporation as a repository for accumulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.003" offset="2051427">Accumulations which if distributed would have been taxed at the progressive rates upon the individual shareholders since corporations have a legal existence apart from that of the individual taxpayers and shareholders, the corporation can be interposed between the source of income and the receipt by the individual owner, thus allowing the beneficial owner to avoid the personal income tax, the tax of graduated rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.865" offset="2154872">This avoidance device has been recognized by Congress since the inception of the modern income tax in 1913 and Sections 531 through 537 are an effort, a statutory effort to overcome the fact that we do not have integration between the income tax and the corporate tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.009" offset="2231359">The purpose of the accumulated earnings tax is as this Court had concluded in Helvering v. Stock Yards, 318 U.S. 693 at page 979, “to compel the company to distribute any profits not needed for the conduct of its business so that when so distributed, individual shareholders will become liable.”</text>
            <text syncTime="553.326" offset="2316727">Underlying this -- underlying the statute is a legislative assumption that it becomes a misuse of a corporation if its profits are retained for the purpose of avoiding the stockholder's individual income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.223" offset="2384227">Judge Learned Hand in United Business Corp. 62 F.2d 754 at 756 said as to the accumulated earnings tax, “Companies may accumulate what profits they please so long as they do not defeat the fiscal policies of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.636" offset="2457893">Their business does not include the manipulation of dividends to avoid taxes by definition that has nothing to do with the normal management of their affairs.”</text>
            <text syncTime="599.538" offset="2501569">Now, the critical language in this provision is the language in 532 availed of for the purpose of avoiding the income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.212" offset="2536260">And in no way does this language import any qualification such as formulated by the Sixth Circuit that this tax avoidance must be the dominant purpose among many purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.281" offset="2584534">Availed of simply means used to the extent tax avoidance induces or aids in inducing in the retention of accumulated earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.436" offset="2629151">The corporation has been used or in the statutory language “availed of” for this prohibited purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.589" offset="2657677">Now, the Government's position is derived from the plain statutory language that implies no further qualification and also from this Court's interpretation of that statutory language in the Stock Yards case.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.503" offset="2713370">We thought as did four circuits that this issue had been made to rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.422" offset="2729044">And the Stock Yards case, the First Circuit, the taxpayer argued that the accumulation policy of the corporation was intended to satisfy the debts of a New Jersey subsidiary upon its contemplated liquidation in 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.891" offset="2790902">Now, this plan had been inaugurated prior to the adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment and consistently followed by the corporation thereafter, so that argued the taxpayer, the corporation could not have been availed of for the proscribed purpose that out in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.949" offset="2863208">And this was their position as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.878" offset="2874911">Now, although the First Circuit reversed the Board of Tax Appeals which had upheld the assertion of the accumulated tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.398" offset="2905004">The First Circuit rejected the taxpayer's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.871" offset="2918902">The First Circuit in Chicago Stock Yards at 129 F.2d.937 at page 948 said, “It is clear that Section 104 would apply if in the totality of reason which induced the continuing of the accumulation, the forbidden motive of surtax avoidance played a substantial part.”</text>
            <text syncTime="726.956" offset="3011166">The First Circuit thus rejected the concept of a dominant purpose theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.027" offset="3031437">It was in this context that the case came to this Court and this Court stated at page 699, “A corporate practice adopted for the mere convenience above or for other reasons and without tax significance when adopted may have been continued with the additional motive of avoiding surtax on the sharehold -- stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.293" offset="3136554">The Board's conclusion, that is the conclusion of the Board of Tax Appeals that the accumulated earnings tax was to impose, may justifiably have been reached in the view that whatever the motive when the practice of accumulation was adopted, the purpose of avoiding surtax induced or aided in inducing, the continuance of the practice.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1893.810" offset="7678621">The issue before this Court is the construction of the statute that's been on the books for many, many years since 1913.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.400" offset="7716968">The statute as enacted at that time provided that a corporation formed or fraudulently availed of for the purpose of preventing tax on the shareholders would trigger a penalty tax on the shareholder at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.878" offset="7782902">There was a rebuttable presumption then as there is now that if earnings were permitted to accumulate beyond the reasonable needs of the business that this was prima facie evidence for the purpose to escape the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.576" offset="7849671">The statute has been amended throughout the years, the word fraudulently was excised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.396" offset="7880913">The tax is now imposed on the corporation rather than the shareholders and instead of a prima facie evidence or rebuttable presumption, we have a virtual determinative assumption and once a corporation accumulates its earnings beyond its reasonable needs that unless the taxpayer can come forward and determinatively show otherwise that the penalty applies.</text>

            <text syncTime="1978.536" offset="8017481">I think there was the question that under common law, it was very difficult to establish fraud and that was the reason that was struck out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.284" offset="8064502">The reason that the tax was then imposed on the shareholder, it was first imposed on the shareholders then it was thought perhaps that it was first imposed on the corporate shareholder and then on a corporation, that was a constitutional question involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.261" offset="8136391">But I think the purpose going into the statute that reading the early cases is that there are a lot of holding company cases involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.834" offset="8178709">At the time the statute was enacted, there was no corporate tax, taxpayers were permitted to deal with their corporation in situations which would lead to tax avoidance and what happened many taxpayers were able to, who had stocks and securities in receiving income on that were able to put it in a corporate shell and really isolate themselves, and insulate themselves from any taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.444" offset="8301171">In addition, the taxpayer was permitted to sell stock which he had purchased to his corporation and if you realize the laws on that, he could take it and I think if this came up, this case came up in 1913, we can make a very strong argument that the purpose required was the sole purpose and that the Court used the word formed fraudulently because it was talking about a situation where a corporation was used in a fraudulent manner, in a manner inconsistent as what we deemed to be the normal use of a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.882" offset="8454875">And I think have this case come up, we could say that the case, the statute would only apply if there was absolutely no reason, no valid reason that the sole purpose for the shareholder of forming this corporation had to be tax avoidance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2210.976" offset="8947231">Well, it's very simple, they say if the shareholder is subject to taxable income, he's in a tax bracket, he has no operating law as carryovers and he has been advised that a distribution would result in taxable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.944" offset="9019120">Well, that's all you have to show because then it follows that accumulating results in an avoidance of the tax which is true.</text>

            <text syncTime="2271.078" offset="9187662">They say, if it's one out of 100 reasons, the tax applies.</text>

            <text syncTime="2313.939" offset="9359130">And I think the whole point of the Government's position is really not asking for a construction of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2334.684" offset="9442095">And we think that at least that a small businessman should have the opportunity to try to rebut this presumption.</text>

            <text syncTime="2362.029" offset="9551496">Well, he just can't sit up there and say, “Well, that wasn't my motive.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.834" offset="9566751">He's got to be fairly specific and concrete in what he's saying and I think that the thing that really disturbs us about this case is you're really preventing expansion of the smaller corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2397.118" offset="9691826">I think perhaps 1913, when this statute was enacted, the business was held and closely held family groups and they represented the substantial and economic power in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.197" offset="9752116">I think things have changed where the substantial economic powers in the publicly held corporations with a statute which was aimed at the power, the economic power is now being applied against the little men and the persons that it was intended to cover initially are just not being covered at this particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.028" offset="9855457">And I think basically, our position here is that simple that what the Government asked is not a construction of the statute.</text>
