            <label>Mr. Thomas J. Klitgaard</label>
            <text syncTime="31.863" offset="230797">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.023" offset="243440">This is a criminal case from California.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.867" offset="258800">It involves the application of the harmless error rule to comment and instruction on petitioner's failure to testify of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.233" offset="292342">The crimes involved were robbery and attempted robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.625" offset="309896">The only issue was one of identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.579" offset="321703">Mixed in, in the totality of the circumstances was a show up, a line up and a showing of photographs by the prosecution to witnesses before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.707" offset="366216">Also involved was the use of petitioner's silence against him in another way that is to the use of adoptive admissions to the use of petitioner's silence in the place of accusations.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.586" offset="417729">At trial procedurally, petitioner was without counsel and defended himself in pro per.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.351" offset="444792">On appeal, there was a partial denial of counsel as we will see.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.927" offset="467048">The case begun in 1962, petitioner was convicted in the Alameda County Superior Court of two counts of robbery and one count of attempted robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.309" offset="512606">He appealed counsel was appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.604" offset="521801">Counsel briefed and argued the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.990" offset="531310">The District Court of appeal affirmed the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.126" offset="543848">Counsel, the next day, after the affirmance wrote petition letters saying he was withdrawing from the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.434" offset="569135">It was no evidence anywhere that counsel sent a letter of that -- a copy of that letter to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.591" offset="597765">Petitioner then went ahead and filed the pro per petition for hearing in a California Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.127" offset="623888">The Court denied the hearing and petitioner then came here.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.890" offset="642905">He filed the pro per petition for cert and in 1966, the Court granted the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.338" offset="668714">And in a per curiam remanded the case to the District Court of Appeal for further consideration in light of Griffin against California.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.255" offset="704345">Alright the court, the case gets back down to the Court of Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.103" offset="719809">Petitioner writes the court and asks for counsel, someone to brief and argue his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.057" offset="743633">The court denies petitioner counsel, it says, he's still represented by the original attorney and if he wants to file a brief, better get one in promptly.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.297" offset="780518">Petitioner eventually filed the brief in pro per.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.039" offset="795564">The State Attorney General sent a paragraph or a page and a half letter to the court saying that, the evidence was overwhelming against petitioner and besides petitioner and his pro per petition had not made any factual showing to show a miscarriage of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.336" offset="860766">The Court without oral argument about two weeks after receiving the state's letter entered -- filed an opinion that incorporated its first opinion by reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.571" offset="905697">Referred briefly to the evidence and then said that in view of the overwhelming evidence of petitioner's guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.028" offset="935476">It was not reasonably probable a different result would have been obtained absent to comment on his failure to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.118" offset="963793">Petitioner again in pro per filed the petition for certiorari in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.106" offset="983751">The Court again granted the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.500" offset="993364">This time it remanded the case to the Court of Appeal with instructions to reconsider the case in light of Chapman, the harmless error rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.967" offset="1031189">Again, petitioner requested the court appoint counsel for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.781" offset="1046444">He did this twice and again the court refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.925" offset="1059088">Petitioner eventually filed the brief in pro per in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.471" offset="1077269">The state didn't file a brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.102" offset="1083747">It just sent in a two-paragraph letter saying that it incorporated by reference, everything that it said before and it did have anything further to add.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.967" offset="1119274">Without hearing argument, without hearing anything from counsel for petitioner, he never filed anything on any of the remands.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.148" offset="1148008">The Court of Appeals, the second time around, entered a two-page opinion said it, it considered the case a couple of times before, it incorporated its first opinion by reference and then went on to say just in the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.875" offset="1198895">After further consideration, we declare a belief based upon the conclusive evidence of guilt that the comment an error and the comment on the failure to testify was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.756" offset="1242363">After that petitioner again came here, he filed a petition in pro per, again asking the Court for a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.083" offset="1267754">The Court granted the petition last October, appointed counsel and set the case down for argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.973" offset="1295235">In January, this Court denied a motion by the state to dispense with printing the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.195" offset="1320103">Now, the state contends that the -- at this point that on the totally of the record, the comment and instruction on petitioner's failure to testify were harmless beyond the reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.945" offset="1367124">It also raises two issues never raise before in the Court of Appeals or it -- or before on this Court -- in this Court, eventhough, it answer each petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.927" offset="1403068">First, it says that petitioner waived his Fifth Amendment rights by the manner in which he depend himself in pro per during the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.588" offset="1433684">During trial, petitioner in cross-examining asks a couple of questions that were less and articulate and it looks like he might have been testifying.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.536" offset="1461478">The Court corrected him.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.765" offset="1466389">He got back on the track and continued on.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.713" offset="1478196">At the end of trial during oral argument after the prosecutor had already commented on his failure to testify and rack them up on that as his final clinching point.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.726" offset="1514245">Petitioner came back and made a few statements that a lawyer would make he said, he was innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.745" offset="1534307">The Court corrected him said, he can't say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.545" offset="1541517">Petitioner said, alright judge and then, he followed the Court's instruction and went on, and made his argument to the jury as best he could.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.202" offset="1572133">Now, the state claims that's a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.983" offset="1583313">He waived his Fifth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.606" offset="1593762">I think the evidence will show as we go along that there was no such waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.033" offset="1611525">Neither the trial court and the prosecutor or any of the lower courts reviewed this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.569" offset="1629602">Everyone suggested there was a waiver and not once during argument to the jury or at anytime during trial did the judge ever tell petitioner that he was in danger of waiving his Fifth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.297" offset="1672547">The other issue is a jurisdictional point is raise for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.426" offset="1689057">The state now says, the court can't hear the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.379" offset="1700864">It made a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.680" offset="1706088">The state says that, the Court should not have remanded the second time for further consideration in light of Chapman and it shouldn't have granted cert this last time.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.311" offset="1752586">The reason as according to the state is that because after each remand, petitioner didn't come back and file a petition for discretionary review in the California Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.758" offset="1794382">As to that point, suffice to say that at the very outset of these whole proceeding, petitioner in pro per went to the California Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.258" offset="1824371">He was denied a hearing under California law that judgment then became final.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.171" offset="1844015">After that, this case was bouncing back and forth between this Court and the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.514" offset="1869406">What petitioner was seeking when he came back here each time was enforcement of this Court's mandate, enforcement of the directions of this Court to give him a hearing, the court below and for that it was proper that he come back here to the Court that issue the mandate rather than to a stranger court.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.655" offset="1930010">Now, the state --</text>

            <text syncTime="1306.962" offset="5331257">Then petitioner got up in his argument and he said, “You've tried to go through the facts and went through about showing a photographs and so forth.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1319.423" offset="5381099">The prosecutor got right back up after that and said to the jury, “Look here he said, you can't expect all the witnesses to agree in what they saw and besides the line up showed to you is guilty.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.719" offset="5426239">Pick him out right there these people and beside that there's lot of circumstantial evidence in this case, lots of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.472" offset="5449226">Let's look at the circumstantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.676" offset="5458108">The prosecutor said, “This is the whole last part of his argument to the jury, closing argument.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.781" offset="5478484">He said, “Petitioner here was cool -- cool, you saw him in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.998" offset="5491336">How cool he was defending himself.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.937" offset="5499068">Well, the robber was described as cool.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.734" offset="5510353">You saw that -- heard the evidence that there was some crumpled money in petitioner's pockets, that's circumstantial evidence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.974" offset="5531251">Other circumstantial evidence is that when petitioner was accused of being the robber by the policeman at the time of the arrest and one of the witnesses said to him in the line up quarter, “that's the man”, when petitioner remains silent there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.051" offset="5579525">That's evidence, that's circumstantial evidence of guilt and you can take into consideration of fact that petitioner didn't testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.092" offset="5607737">And the courts going to tell you and I'm telling you now that you -- if he could have denied it, you'll be instructed that that you can infer that he wasn't able to deny it and you can take his failure to testify in consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.842" offset="5654758">Now, petitioner's defense basically was -- it was former.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.542" offset="5669491">He earned his money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.210" offset="5676178">He's been working in Pittsburgh, a little town outside of Concord, outside of Oakland and if prosecutor got up and he said, well, we know that as his last punch of petitioner after this other failure to testify business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.585" offset="5729677">He got up and said, well, you know petitioner says he earned his money and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.279" offset="5748485">But we all know lots of people have bills and things like that and we don't know that the money of the petitioner had in his pocket was the same money he earned because he hasn't got to understand and told you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.564" offset="5789654">And then he says petitioner asked why people rob?</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.505" offset="5801357">He said, you can ask lots of people why people rob.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.971" offset="5815254">Lots of persons you could ask that question too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.062" offset="5823613">And then he says to the jury at the very end winding up, you can take in consideration not just the direct evidence but look at all these circumstantial evidence, who have just been talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.185" offset="5860080">You can reach your verdict on that and then the Court went on to instruct on this accusations that that was something jury could consider in his admission of guilt, instructed on a failure to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.788" offset="5914520">The state makes a big deal out of petitioner coping somewhere from the California standard instruction book in the long hand, an instruction on the failure to testify and giving it to the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.285" offset="5960495">The judge had already told petitioner he's going to give the instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.169" offset="5972093">The judge didn't give the instruction, petitioner tried to write out to give a far more damning one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.597" offset="5989752">They told the jury that if petitioner was in the position to understand all these and know the facts and then deny him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.681" offset="6014098">Then the jury could take that into consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.339" offset="6028727">There is one point, the other point I want to test -- bring up not testify to and that's the denial of counsel of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.204" offset="6064149">Now, petitioner had been represented by the public defender at the preliminary hearing and at the arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.538" offset="6109497">And as you can see from the bringing of briefs there are three crimes it was important that if he could as a tactical matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.484" offset="6137292">The petitioner would be tried separately on each of those crimes because any avoid that overlap and the modus operandi argument that the like the prosecutor made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.427" offset="6173132">So, petitioner goes to your -- to the arraignment and that public defender tells the judge, he wants to make a motion for separate trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.038" offset="6215555">Alright, but then instead of arguing the motion, he tells the judge, we'll take it under submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.553" offset="6237602">Next week or so, they come back to Court for a hearing and the judge turns to the public -- to the prosecutor and says, what do you have to say about this motion for separate trials that prosecutor, the DA makes his speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.631" offset="6297893">Then petitioner, his lawyer gets up and says, “Well, the pleadings are defective.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.827" offset="6314715">That's about it and the Court overrules the motion for separate trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.193" offset="6328195">Petitioner then the next time they go to Court, petitioner asked that public defender if he can ask the Court a question you -- it says the judge, "So Your Honor, I don't think its constitutional, if the (Inaudible) at the same time for these crimes and instead of defending the standing up for his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.227" offset="6400293">The public defender says the judge, “Well Your Honor, you said the -- this is the same thing I raised before a couple of weeks ago and you already ruled against petitioner on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.909" offset="6431013">He's just raising the same point now on put on a different constitutional ground.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.125" offset="6451911">And then the defendant says, “I think it's reasonable but so forth, and the judges out hearing from the DA simply goes ahead and denies the motion.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.940" offset="6483153">Two weeks later petitioner comes back before the judge for a hearing to set a trial date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.384" offset="6500916">He says to the judge butts in, it says, Your Honor, can you take care of this constitutional thing for me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.920" offset="6527039">And that -- and on similar facts and the public defendant says, “I don't know his talking about now” to the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.765" offset="6558386">He says, “You've already ruled on the motion for separate trials.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.785" offset="6570506">And then the judge denied, the judge law is talking about separate trial in each of the three counts and the motion is denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.643" offset="6593912">And then petitioner said, “I don't want to be represented anymore by the public defender.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.219" offset="6612198">The Court looks at the charges so you can't put a serious crimes can't waive it, can't waive a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.140" offset="6643963">But the petitioner says, I don't want to be represented by this man anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.854" offset="6654830">It doesn't look to me like public defender's office is any match for the DA around here not qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.425" offset="6681057">That will and the judge says, alright, you can go to trial by yourself but we'll have someone from the public defender's office sit inside the courtroom with you behind there and will help you out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.229" offset="6712299">And just then the public defender apply his evidence says, “Wait a minute, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.394" offset="6724942">Can I be heard?</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.476" offset="6729226">Looks this guy looks like a wise guy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.124" offset="6735914">He's trying to pull something off and his trying to look like a poor little man infront of the public, infront of the DA being picked upon.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.467" offset="6761200">If one of his legal points bounces on him, it's going to be real tough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.600" offset="6773739">He says, “I don't want any part of this mixed merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.428" offset="6781053">Either we go -- either he goes along or he goes with us.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.160" offset="6795995">And the Court then said to the public defender, listen, you have someone here in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.495" offset="6817311">So the next day -- about two weeks later, petitioner comes up for trial before a different judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.014" offset="6835388">This judge hears about petitioner wanting counsel and he requires in the petitioners background.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.314" offset="6852629">He finds out that he's got a record, a young man in Illinois have been convicted for murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.469" offset="6869243">He's been out for parole in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.436" offset="6877080">Working as a plumber up in Pittsburgh, sixth grade education, mentally defective, he's been in the hospital for mental treatment and emotionally upset about the charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.453" offset="6909158">The judge says, “Look!”</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.611" offset="6913860">He says, “You can't defend yourself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.069" offset="6919607">This is -- no man should defend himself in felony charge.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.423" offset="6929115">And petitioner says, “I'm not going to stick with this public defender.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.386" offset="6940923">I want someone that qualified, someone I have confidence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.735" offset="6954297">The judge says, “Well, take the public defender or nobody.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.799" offset="6966523">Meanwhile, while all of these are going on of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.892" offset="6974986">There's an assistant public defender listening to it, happens at trial what was being said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.330" offset="6992645">The case comes back, the judge says, “Well alright, you have to go by yourself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.805" offset="7010617">I can't give any help.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.201" offset="7016155">Then petitioner in the real flash of brilliance says the judge, “Well, I look better on appeal if I go up without counsel.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.292" offset="7040502">And the judge jump up and said, “What do you mean by that?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.765" offset="7050428">Petitioner said, “What I mean is, I think I still have a right to counsel that points some other than the public defender.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.218" offset="7072266">So, he goes before the next judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.716" offset="7086268">He disqualifies the judge, he asked for change of venue to go back before the first guy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.873" offset="7102882">He gets back before the first judge, the one who heard the public defender call him a wise guy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.652" offset="7122004">Petitioner and this judge says, “Well, you can still have the public defender.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.534" offset="7133497">Petitioner says, “I don't want the public defender.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.062" offset="7139662">Just appoint anybody from the open bar, just anybody, other than a public defender.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.362" offset="7156799">Somebody I can believe in.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.907" offset="7162964">The judge says, “Go to trial as a public defender without anybody.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.556" offset="7177592">And then he says, “Well.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.224" offset="7184280">Then petitioner says, “Well, how about this guy who's been sitting here, the assistant public defender.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.372" offset="7200893">The assistant public defender was present during the second proceeding when all this come out of our petitioner's background and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.901" offset="7227016">He didn't say a word to the judge about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.396" offset="7236942">He just kept his mouth shut.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.098" offset="7243734">So the third judge, I mean with the first judge, who heard petitioner call the wise guy was it -- finally the judge who tried this case but the public defender who was in between him, both didn't report back to this -- to the trial judge the way heard at the prior proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.937" offset="7303084">The petitioner had a sixth grade education and he was all -- he was a plumber and so forth, and so petitioner goes to trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1866.548" offset="7569533">The initial point that I wish to bring to this Court's attention is that of this Court's jurisdiction to review the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.952" offset="7615195">This Court's jurisdiction in reviewing state courts' decisions is of course limited to those judgments rendered by the highest court of a state in which decision could be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.986" offset="7667336">After this Court remanded, the Banks case to be reviewed in light of Chapman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.378" offset="7688861">The Court of Appeals of California rendered its position on October 2, 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.838" offset="7714774">The petitioner did not thereafter petition for a hearing in the California Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.210" offset="7736195">It is well settled that the judgment of an intermediate appellate court is not that of a highest state court where discretionary review is available and not sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.046" offset="7791574">That is precisely the situation here under California Constitution and laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.576" offset="7813726">The California Supreme Court has discretionary power to review the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.233" offset="7836296">And therefore, the judgment in this case is not of the highest court of state.</text>

            <text syncTime="1945.480" offset="7885302">On the remand, he sent a letter into the Court of Appeals stating that he wished a second counsel or a different counsel and gave as his reason that the counsel, his appointed counsel on the original appeal decided in 1964 did not raise the Griffin constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.680" offset="7990105">But the Court of Appeals answered petitioner's letter and pointed out to him that he was not in effect that he could not expect counsel to anticipate that to be clairvoyant to spot the Griffin issue in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.454" offset="8057187">Indeed, this Court has said as much in the O'Connor versus Ohio case and he gave no other reason to the Court of Appeals as to why he should be entitled to a second or different counsel.</text>
