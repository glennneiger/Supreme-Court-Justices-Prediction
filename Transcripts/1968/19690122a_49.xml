            <label>Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell</label>
            <text syncTime="153.233" offset="716257">I'm going to reach that in the course of my argument.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="155.551" offset="725556">That's why I didn't really understand why you made your opening statement because there is that issue.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_c_mcconnell" startTime="161.283" stopTime="1158.542">
            <label>Mr. Thomas C. Mcconnell</label>
            <text syncTime="161.283" offset="748544">There is that issue, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.945" offset="767143">I simply made a statement because -- as part of the facts in the case that there was that pretrial stipulation and I'm treating, for this portion of the argument, the two corporations as the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.291" offset="832554">In that suit, Zenith answered by setting up a patent and other patents of Hazeltine have been misused by putting them into foreign patent pools, which foreign patent pools had refused to license imports and had restricted commerce between United States and foreign countries, namely Canada, England, and Australia, contrary to the provisions of the antitrust law, the federal antitrust law that any restriction or any combination, conspiracy, or arrangement between competitors which restrain commerce not only between the states of the United States but between the comp -- the country of the United States and foreign countries, violated Section 4 of the Clayton Act, Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.989" offset="1099316">And, under those two sections, also Section 16 of the Clayton Act, alleging the same facts as we'd set up in the misused answer we filed in counterclaim and, in that counterclaim, asked for travel damages and asked for an injunction against the activities of these foreign patent tools.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.576" offset="1221674">After a trial and findings of fact in detail made by the District Court, a judgment was entered on April 5, 1965 pursuant to Rule 54 (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for damages which have been occasioned by the plaintiff or by the counterclaim in the amount of $19,042,173 for the loss of sales and profits in the Canadian market in the sale of home receiving sets in television and radio.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.336" offset="1440684">At the time the findings came down, Hazeltine obtained new counsel and came in and made various motions which are discussed in the briefs, purport of which was to reopen the case on evidence which was available at the time of the trial and for further proceedings on the claim that there were embargoes imposed by the government as opposed to private patent pools and conspiracies in England and Australia.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.558" offset="1625631">And, for that limited purpose, the case was reopened and after further hearing, on December 13, 1965, the Trial Court awarded petitioner trouble damages in the amount of $15,919,458 for loss of sales and profits in England and Australia during the damage period.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.430" offset="1761050">In the first judgment, an injunction was added against the continuance by the respondent companies and these pools for putting their patents in the pools or in any way furthering the activities of these pools, and this is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.407" offset="1856972">No supercedias was ever foiled to that judgment, even though there was an appeal, and since that first judgment was entered on April 15, 19 -- or April 5, 1965, Zenith has been operating under the protection of the injunction of the United States District Court in their activities in Kent.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.495" offset="1993331">On appeal or in entering the last judgment after the Trial Court had heard all the evidence that was produced on the original trial press, all of the different matters which were urged and argued in a three or four-day hearing on the motions to reopen the case and after hearing everything that was submitted in the case, Trial Court made this comment, "there could be no question in my mind that Zenith suffered damages during the damage period by a virtue of the pools which I have found and, reiterate, existed at the time of the damage period."</text>
            <text syncTime="531.832" offset="2230732">The Court of Appeals reversed both the judgments on the ground that there is no substantial evidence in this record that Zenith was injured by the activities of these pools in its business or property, and held as a matter of law that, on this record, Zenith was not even threatened with injury by the activities of these pools.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.908" offset="2391019">Now, the proof of injury to Zenith's business in Canada was, in a large part, documentary and I'm going into it in some detail in the course of this argument, and was not denied by any single witness or document in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.652" offset="2498017">So, It is my submission to this Court that what is presented is whether on admitted facts, which we claim in the District Court, found was unequivocal in its proof of actual substantial damage to the Zenith Corporation, whether under those admitted facts, as a matter of law, the federal antitrust laws, namely 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act, do not reach and have no sanction which will stop that country.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.082" offset="2707728">Now, before going to the individual markets, I want to -- if the Court will bear with me, I want to take just a few minutes to give some of the background of this conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.682" offset="2782124">And, this Court in 1962 and in subsequent cases has held, namely in the Continental Ore case, that conspiracies which are designed to control a complete market and which are put together by competitors to exclude competition permanent should not be judged by taking particular parts of the proofs and examining them and passing on to something else, but that the proof should be looked at as a whole and, in the Continental Ore case, that it was highly relevant to go back and look at the proofs at the inception of the conspiracy and the proofs out of which the conspiracy was created to show its intendment, its purpose, its effect, and its result.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.230" offset="3044289">Now, I've been in this litigation with these pools on behalf of Zenith since 1953 and I'm not going to refer any of my own personal knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.421" offset="3113044">Everything I'm going to tell this Court with reference to the beginning is in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.799" offset="3142614">And, may I say at the threshold of this case, the documentary evidence in this case came in by a pretrial stipulation without any objection that documents as to their varied, all admitted, no objection to them whatever, no contravening evidence of any kind, and some of it and most of it and the part I'm now going to talk about, put in by my opponents in the Trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.330" offset="3304678">From 1919 until 1935, through some-50 cross licensing agreements, the leading electronic companies of the world divided up the markets of the world, I'm leaving out the Iron Curtain countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.811" offset="3402585">I'm talking now about the free world countries where competition is possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.196" offset="3436126">Among those companies were the telephone companies: the Westinghouse Company, RCA, General Electric Company, English Electric Company, the Telefunken Company, the General Electric Company of Germany, GTS, the French Company, Standard Cables and Wireless, the Australian Company, and the Philips Company of Harland which we find everywhere which is the largest electronics company and probably the largest aggregation of capital and business in the entire world.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.218" offset="3636224">Now, all of these companies shoulder-to-shoulder and by cross licensing agreement divided the free world up into markets and part of that was the North American Continent which was assigned to the so-called radio group.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.614" offset="3709785">And, the radio group was composed of the telephone company, that's American telephone and telegraph company, General Electric, RCA, the Westinghouse Company, and the Philips Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.724" offset="3786271">Zenith came into conflict and confrontation with this worldwide conspiracy when, in 1933, RCA with 10,000 patents in the pool which was composed of patents contributed by all the companies that I have now mentioned, some-10,000 of them, asserted them against Zenith and demanded that we take a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.967" offset="3891284">And, we took the position and said so in our pleadings which are in this case that the whole industry in the United States had paid tribute to this pool for years and $1,300,000.00 or so have been paid in tribute to the pool, that the pools were illegal and we filed a suit in the United States District Court down in Delaware asking for a determination that the pools were illegal, and the case was before Judge Leigh, now dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.184" offset="4064110">Immediately, the pool countered with 63 patent suits against us in that proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.262" offset="4104443">Parenthetically, we got the trial and one of them, it took 18 months to try it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.355" offset="4128789">If we tried them all, there wouldn't have been a lawyer left alive who'd ever had any connection with the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.456" offset="4173197">They countered out of that suit by suing Zenith in the United States District Court in Chicago on two patents: the telephone company, RCA and General Electric.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.924" offset="4227114">And, in that suit, Zenith counterclaimed and set up a suit for trouble damages claiming that they had been excluded from the market in Canada and couldn't sell their goods there because of the pool which was part of the overall conspiracy, the pool known as Canadian Radio Patents Limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.920" offset="4339022">That suit got down to trial that they go to trial on September 9, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.821" offset="4362637">The Sunday before it went to trial, the parties settled the case by paying Zenith $10 million, giving Zenith the patent rights inventing these black and white monochrome patents in all markets and in the -- and, the suit down at Delaware was dismissed upon there and, in effect, dedicate the patents, 10,000 of them, to the train.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.897" offset="4502967">Now, I brought that in for a purpose because Zenith is represented here as, in some way, taking advantage of the antitrust laws when, I submit, on the entire record, they have done very constructive service under the antitrust laws, and they free the entire American market so that, from that time on, and the relevance of this is on the damage proof that from that time on, we had a free market in United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.164" offset="4663986">And, with a free market, Zenith came from a little small company hardly known to the leading company in television and, I think, the second or third producer in the United States in radio.</text>

            <text syncTime="2799.331" offset="11300655">And, by the way, the District Court found that the instant suit, which was brought in a Hazeltine patent which was in the pool, was brought pursuant to the pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.172" offset="11360110">Hazeltine came into this pool in 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.591" offset="11373693">The record shows that they volunteered their patents to be used in litigation against importers, documentary evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.269" offset="11408488">The record shows that they were in these pools by their own admission knowing that the purpose of the pool was to exclude importation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2845.077" offset="11483721">And, they said they were in the pool, the Canadian pool, and they intended -- right in the trial they said they were in the pool and they intended to stay in that pool, flaunted their participation in the pool, and they said the reason for it was to get more bucks for Hazeltine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.950" offset="11591137">Well, I suppose every illegal activity from the beginning of time down to date has had something about getting more bucks or more money out of the illegal activity, and that, certainly, is no justification with all due deference.</text>

            <text syncTime="3558.274" offset="14336502">After the 1957 settlement, as I said this morning, the Zenith Company undertook to go into the Canadian market with their radio and television sets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.875" offset="14410898">Now, here are two contiguous markets, Canada and United States, fighting alongside each other so far as the boring areas are concerned, Canadian listeners can pick up broadcast from television and radio along the border of American stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.550" offset="14501595">There's no difference in the sets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.132" offset="14507865">They had the same lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.401" offset="14512985">They had the same cycles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.360" offset="14524792">Testimony was that the two products -- of the two products, that the American product was far superior than to the Canadian product, that the contiguous markets had essentially the same competition, although there was more competition in the United States market than there was in United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.944" offset="14655195">Mr. Wright testified that he went up there and tried to establish distribution in that market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.381" offset="14684871">There was a ready demand for a product, survey had shown that, and he couldn't find distributors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.516" offset="14729488">Distributors, as I pointed out this morning, were in these associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.347" offset="14752789">We have the minutes of some of their meetings tied up with the pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.191" offset="14784136">He couldn't get distributors for the reason that they had been conditioned like Pablo's dog for years and years to the sounding of the gong of the Canadian Radio Patents, the threat the constant inherent threat against everybody in the trade with the warning notices, with the investigations, with the lawsuits, and that was the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.001" offset="14919346">And, the pool was there, still in existence, run by a General Electric even though the government had started the suit against them and had gotten a consent decree whereby three of the conspiring companies had agreed to license their sets without importation which, by the way, negative any thought that there was anything in Canadian law that would prevent them from licensing for importation, but permitted the General Electric Company to continue to run that pool and General, I think, continued to run the pool with a permitted organization, managers, investigators, and what have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.697" offset="15086111">So, Mr. Wright testified that he couldn't get distribution, the kind of distribution to which a product of Zenith was entitled to in a market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.598" offset="15129788">And, the reason he couldn't get it was because of the threats of the pool against the potential distributors which he tried to get.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.483" offset="15161344">He said he could get some distribution in the western provinces where there are very sparse settlements out there and some in the maritime province.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.330" offset="15200737">But, along the contiguous territories, he couldn't get them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.813" offset="15214634">So, he had to use the hearing aid distributor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.630" offset="15233860">We had a hearing aid distributor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.478" offset="15241279">That's another product of Zenith.</text>

            <text syncTime="5234.116" offset="21039835">Well, it's unique so far as the Courts that I've been practicing before is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5245.342" offset="21084766">The Court reversed on the ground that the findings were clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="5252.663" offset="21114023">That showed an impact on Zenith's business.</text>
            <text syncTime="5258.079" offset="21135653">The Court followed the rule announced by this Court in Gypsum to the effect that a finding is clearly erroneous and, although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing Court on the entire evidence is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5279.419" offset="21221021">And, the Court said that that was the situation with them in the Court of Appeals in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5287.078" offset="21251636">Now, Mr. McConnell said nothing about England, although the amount of damages awarded by the Court on the English pool was approximately the same in the neighborhood of $15 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="5303.030" offset="21315480">The reason, I think, that Mr. McConnell said nothing about England, the reason was that the testimony in connection with the English pool demonstrated, I think, to the Court of Appeals that the statements of Mr. Wright, President of Zenith, and Mr. Kaplan, Executive Vice-President of Zenith were not believable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5339.607" offset="21461765">And, in the -- in connection with the analysis of the Court of Appeals of the record with respect to England, that fact is demonstrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5350.985" offset="21507323">These two men not only testified with respect to the English pool, they testified with respect to impact, as Mr. McConnell said, and with respect to the amount of damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="5362.685" offset="21554134">They testified on those subjects with respect to the Canadian pool as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="5371.940" offset="21591124">Now, the Zenith evidence submitted by Mr. Wright through Mr. Wright and Mr. Kaplan, is unbelievable on crucial issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5394.983" offset="21683284">It was either repudiated and recanted by the witnesses themselves, it was shown to be incorrect by later evidence and undisputed findings, or it was directly contradicted by a contemporaneous documents which are in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5412.790" offset="21754546">Now, in connection with the English pool, the -- we went in on a motion to reopen the case as to the English pool upon getting into the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5427.116" offset="21811806">And, we made the motion on the ground that we would be able to show that embargos, governmental -- English governmental embargos prohibited and made impossible the importation of radio and television sets for 20 years before 1959 and there were, as a result, two separate hearings as to England.</text>
            <text syncTime="5453.424" offset="21917027">The first was in 1964, after which the Court entered finding 36, read by Mr. McConnell exactly as submitted by Zenith, awarding damages in the amount of $24 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="5468.298" offset="21976586">Now, that finding and that award in England was based upon testimony of these two men as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="5479.338" offset="22020681">I want to briefly summarize it and then show what they said when they came back on the second trial which was awarded to us limitedly on embargos as to England, but which we were not permitted to have as to Canada.</text>

            <text syncTime="5755.554" offset="23125556">I'm sure that was the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="5758.902" offset="23138931">May I say that the -- first, it was said that for many years, as I said, Zenith had tried to import to England.</text>
            <text syncTime="5767.607" offset="23173831">On each occasion, it was said the British pool threatened distributors until they seized buying Zenith products.</text>
            <text syncTime="5774.811" offset="23202565">And, it was claimed that Zenith -- that the English pool had prevented Zenith from building up its market.</text>
            <text syncTime="5781.167" offset="23228061">They testified that during the four-year period, 1959-1963, Zenith had in fact attempted to market its TV sets in England converted from the American standard, the 525-line standard in America, to a unique British 405-line system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5800.517" offset="23305488">They testified that Zenith had so-converted its sets, and said sets converted to its English distributor with kits and parts to make conversions where necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5811.685" offset="23350105">They testified further that the conversion was so simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="5814.672" offset="23362017">Ramsey, the English Distributor, did it in his backroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="5818.044" offset="23375600">That he had made such conversions, had made an effort to sell these sets after the embargo was lifted in 1959, but was unable to do so because he was precluded by the pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="5829.186" offset="23420113">Now, that was the testimony of these men at their -- at the first hearing, precisely what I have said.</text>
            <text syncTime="5836.213" offset="23448221">Now, they all -- with all -- then, they make two basic contentions by their testimony, that these things had happened, that that's what had hurt them, that that's how they were damaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="5848.416" offset="23497017">Now, turning to the first point that, for many years prior to 1959, the pool had blocked Zenith's attempts to sell and that they had been unable to build up a market.</text>
            <text syncTime="5862.049" offset="23551561">Now, the government's brief, the Solicitor General said that this contention of long exclusion of the pool was Zenith's basic theory of recovery which, indeed, it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="5872.546" offset="23593566">Now, after the Court's findings were entered, as I say, we file this motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5877.832" offset="23614673">We urge that we could prove that there was nothing to this contention with respect to the impos -- the blocking by the pool in England before 1959 where there's nothing it, we could prove that government embargos was what did it and it was not the pools at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5899.266" offset="23700459">Now, on that motion and in the course of that argument, Zenith counsel denied that there were any embargos.</text>
            <text syncTime="5907.581" offset="23733687">He objected to reopening the case on the ground there were no embargos and he said, and I quote from page 3034 -- 3035 to 3039 of the record, "there never was an embargo, never.</text>
            <text syncTime="5921.080" offset="23787708">We can prove just the opposite."</text>
            <text syncTime="5924.820" offset="23802650">Zenith's counsel further asserted to the Trial Court, "contrary to the representations made in open Court by counsel for Hazeltine, there never has been an embargo, that is, there never has been a governmental prohibition against importation of radios and television receivers either in England or Australia."</text>
            <text syncTime="5947.486" offset="23893347">Now, that's what he argued to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5949.913" offset="23903065">That's what he said in opposing our motion to reopen, but the Court did reopened to enable us to put in proof of embargos limited to that question, and we did put in proof of the embargos and we did show that the embargos existed and that was the reason we were kept out of the English pool for 20 years, from 1930 -- 1920 -- 1939 to 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="5979.953" offset="24023228">That was proof beyond a doubt, and the Court then held that the iron curtain of the governmental embargos and nothing else kept Zenith out of England prior to June 1959 and out of Australia prior to April 1960, which was the date of lifting the embargos of Australia.</text>

            <text syncTime="6040.571" offset="24265644">It was Wright and Kaplan who led the Trial Court to believe that the pool had kept Zenith out of England during those periods, and I would like to make this reading from the record, this question on the second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6057.487" offset="24333354">Question: "Now, is it a fact, Mr. Kaplan," this is cross-examination by Mr. Kayser, "that Zenith has taken the position from the beginning of this litigation that, for many years, it was excluded with a patent pool from importing radio and television sets into all three countries?"</text>
            <text syncTime="6073.537" offset="24397511">The court, well, it has not only taken that position, but they persuaded the Court to so-find and Mr. Kaplan said, "that is correct."</text>
            <text syncTime="6082.901" offset="24435022">When Mr. Wright was recalled he said "now, you told this Court that you had been excluded from England, Canada, and Australia for many years by the patent pools."</text>
            <text syncTime="6094.347" offset="24480789">Answer: "yes, sir."</text>
            <text syncTime="6095.634" offset="24485909">"You told this Court that, based on that exclusion, you were entitled to damages during the statutory period."</text>
            <text syncTime="6101.383" offset="24508897">"Yes, sir, and, the fact is that they were precluded and kept out of England by the embargos and nothing but the embargoes."</text>
            <text syncTime="6109.786" offset="24542542">Now, at the second hearing, faced with proof of the embargos, they testified that they'd known about the embargos all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6118.819" offset="24578696">Now, they hadn't mentioned it at the first trial, hadn't mentioned it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6122.409" offset="24593011">They said, "why, we knew about that all the time."</text>

            <text syncTime="6132.221" offset="24632299">He said, as I read to the Court, "there were no embargos.</text>

            <text syncTime="6462.082" offset="25951692">We did that, and the reason we did that was that we wanted to show that their contention was incorrect, that the pool had been keeping them out, as finding 36 said, the pool had been keeping them out all these years.</text>
            <text syncTime="6474.948" offset="26003205">The pool didn't keep them out.</text>

            <text syncTime="6481.283" offset="26028492">They had contended that they were -- that they -- had the pool not kept them up -- kept them out all those years, they would have build up a market in England to a very high level which would have yielded them profits during the damage period that they were unable to earn.</text>
            <text syncTime="6499.805" offset="26102575">Now, that is the reason for it, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="6502.551" offset="26113546">Now, I want to say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6504.695" offset="26122115">This is a point specifically mentioned by the Court of Appeals in the Court of Appeals' opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6510.489" offset="26145311">Their contention was that Zenith had intended to import TV sets to England beginning in 1959 but were blocked by the pool and, as I say, the testimony was the uncontradicted documents or the contrary but Zenith's counsel characterized Kaplan's testimony as being that he was able to convert to the English standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="6533.317" offset="26236635">He was able to convert from the 525-line to the 409-line and it was so simple that Ramsey could do it in his backroom with a screwdriver, as Mr. McConnell characterizes, that they were converting these American-made sets to the English standard throughout the damage period and that they were trying to sell them, but couldn't sell them because of the activities of the pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="6560.886" offset="26346872">Now, on recall, they were forced to say, contrary what they had said at the first hearing, no television sets had been converted by Zenith to the English 5 -- 405-line standard, no conversion kits had been furnished to Ramsey, as they had said, no sets had been adopted by the English distributor to the English 405-line standard, and no sets had been offered by Zenith in the English market at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="6590.273" offset="26464423">Now, I think this testimony of Mr. Wright, when confronted with this testimony he had given at the first trial compared to what he said at the second trial, is revealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6608.392" offset="26536939">Question: "When you told the Court back in 1964 that Zenith had sent a few television sets to Mr. Ramsey which he had attempted to market, you did not know whether or not those sets were equipped to receive English television?"</text>
            <text syncTime="6624.226" offset="26600260">"No, sir, I did not."</text>
            <text syncTime="6626.004" offset="26607365">"When you told the Court that Mr. Ramsey had attempted to market these sets, did you know whether or not he did in fact attempt to market them?"</text>
            <text syncTime="6634.241" offset="26640384">Answer: "I did not know specifically what he had done."</text>
            <text syncTime="6639.907" offset="26662954">Now, the government agrees that there were variations in the testimony of these men.</text>
            <text syncTime="6645.132" offset="26683852">I'm talking about the Solicitor General's brief now, that there were variations in their testimony, that they had modified their testimony by the 1965 assertions, and the Solicitor General states that this change in their testimony could justify the conclusion for the Trial Court that other aspects of their testimony were also unworthy of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6667.658" offset="26774026">Now, in Zenith's brief to this Court, and I'm referring to their -- to pages 86-88, they quote from the some of the same discredited testimony about the distributor converting sets and asserts "there was no denial of this testimony and there is no other evidence in this record on the issue where the other evidence in the record on the issue is their recanting the testimony when they got to trial the second time."</text>

            <text syncTime="7002.692" offset="28114108">I think that the Court was right in relying upon the decision of the Gypsum case that a finding is clearly erroneous when, although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing Court on the entire record is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="7022.678" offset="28194043">Now, that is the rule that has been followed in the question of the power of the Court of Appeals to reverse a decision of the Trial Court since the DuPont decision which, I believe, was some-25 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="7039.438" offset="28261125">Now, the contention is raised here that the jury rule should apply in this case despite the fact that this was a case tried by the Court and without a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="7056.830" offset="28330715">The -- Mr. McConnell also has made that contention and that, I assume, is -- and I think also the suggestion of the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="7070.346" offset="28384737">But, for the -- there's no doubt at all that Rule 52 (a) makes the provision that I've referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="7077.065" offset="28411591">There's no doubt at all that, under the decision in the Gypsum case, the rule is that the Court of Appeals has the right to reverse even though there's some evidence to support the findings when they're left with this definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed, and the Court said -- stated that it was left with the definite and firm commitment -- conviction that a mistake had been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="7101.845" offset="28510751">And, I must say, that the government, as much as it admits, that applying the standard -- the established standard under 52 (a) as gov -- as stated in the Gypsum case that the Court of Appeals was right in reversing on that ground if you assume that that ground is the correct one.</text>

            <text syncTime="7888.804" offset="31658611">Before getting to the subject of Canada, I'd like to devote just another minute on the subject of England and, I think, possibly clarify what may be somewhat of a misunderstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="7908.365" offset="31736874">The fact is that, as to England, the testimony of Wright and Kaplan which had formed the basis of the findings was two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="7922.103" offset="31791835">First, the testimony about having been kept out of England by the pools for many years, which was disproved by the later proof of the embargo, this was one part of their factual damage theory as to England, that the pools had kept them from developing a market by June 1959 from which developed market they could then profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="7947.779" offset="31894444">And then, the second part of their assertion was that, in fact, during the four years, they were interested in an intent in going into England and does -- the testimony that Mr. Chadwell has referred to, having to do with the contention they built a few sets or converted a few sets and that the English distributor had tried to sell them, that evidence had been put in to indicate interest in the English market.</text>
            <text syncTime="7977.185" offset="32012100">And, that was the evidence that they relied on to show interest and readiness to go into the English market during that four-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="7988.990" offset="32059329">Now, when they got back on the stand and were forced to admit that that testimony was not true, they were forced to admit it because we had taken the distributor's deposition and he admitted that there was nothing to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="8005.400" offset="32124949">When they were forced to admit that there was nothing to their original testimony, that did two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="8012.281" offset="32152534">Number one, it seriously impaired, we submit, their credibility on all aspects but, secondly, it knocked out the second of the two aspects upon which their English claim was based.</text>
            <text syncTime="8029.189" offset="32220139">So, at that point in fact, they have no evidence in this record on which to base any claim as to England other than their -- they had this question of exhibit 220, the inferences to be drawn from that, which I will come to later.</text>
            <text syncTime="8048.520" offset="32297462">Now, secondly, before going into Canada, I would like to answer the questions or respond to the inquiry this morning as concerns the matter of a release.</text>

            <text syncTime="8355.190" offset="33524172">It was a matter of judgment to put our thrust where we thought it was the most clear that the judgment below -- judgments below were wrong, and that's what we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="8368.269" offset="33576417">Now, on the issue of release, I think, it, and I will spend just a moment on that but, it should be clear that the releases were in fact pleaded in the District Court by leave of Court and before entry of judgment there.</text>
            <text syncTime="8394.557" offset="33681638">And, we have covered that point in our reply to the Solicitor General's brief where the point was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="8405.904" offset="33726986">Also, I think it should be pointed out that, on Zenith's reply brief filed in this Court on page 16, Zenith admitted that the Trial Court permitted the filing of the briefs -- of the pleas as of a date a year after the trial and then properly overruled a motion to dismiss the counterclaim on these grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="8428.158" offset="33816012">The releases were, in fact, pleaded admittedly after the original trial but before judgment by leave of the Trial Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="8442.796" offset="33874526">Your Honor, again, we were not counsel but I think the reason they were not pleaded at the first trial was because, under the theory of action which was set forth in the original counterclaim, there would've been no conceivable basis to plead them because, as set forth in that counterclaim and in that motion to file it and, in the affidavit of Mr. Carodi, counsel -- one of counsel for Zenith, it was recited that the acts complained of which formed the basis of this counterclaim which was not filed until 1963, three years after the answer had taken place, after the filing of the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="8480.401" offset="34024991">Well now, that was a span of three years before filing of the answer, and I would submit it would be quite obvious that, under those circumstances, the release would have no possible applicability.</text>
            <text syncTime="8492.775" offset="34074520">And, it was only after, as we pointed out in brief, Zenith switched its theory of action to claim not that the action in the past three years had caused damage but that, by reason of the Acts going back to 1926, as you -- if you heard, Zenith had been damaged in the effect of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="8513.206" offset="34156231">It wasn't until that point that the release became applicable and, at that time, when we got into the case we pleaded it and we're permitted to plead it.</text>
            <text syncTime="8524.104" offset="34199803">Now, as to the question of Canada, I think we must remember that the issue that we have here is whether or not there was a damaging impact by the Canadian pool upon Zenith's Canadian business during the four-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="8549.615" offset="34301785">And, by reason of the testimony given by the Zenith witnesses, the final ultimate issue or question there is, we believe, as the Solicitor General correctly stated it, namely whether Zenith was unable to obtain a full-fledged Canadian distribution system during the period from June 1959 through May 1963 and, if not, whether such inability was attributable to the actions of the Canadian pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="8584.173" offset="34440025">Now, that is the issue as to Canada as to fact of damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="8590.137" offset="34463953">Now, we've heard a great deal this morning about this alleged gigantic international worldwide conspiracy and, incidentally, the proofs and the findings do not support that.</text>
            <text syncTime="8601.509" offset="34509406">But, in any event, we have heard that language about these alleged conspiracies or giant conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="8609.843" offset="34542738">Well, there are several observations to be made there.</text>
            <text syncTime="8612.640" offset="34553919">First, Mr. McConnell has said, as to Canada, that its evidence is almost entirely documentary and, yes, it is and it is all before 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="8626.799" offset="34610552">Secondly, I think we should remember that Zenith is not entitled to any recovery here by reason of any alleged illegality of the Canadian pool or any other pool or by reason of any overt act which may have been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="8643.270" offset="34676485">It is entitled to recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="8644.811" offset="34682650">It is asking that it'd be paid money.</text>
            <text syncTime="8647.831" offset="34694666">It's entitled to that only if it can show that there was an impact -- a damaging impact by those pools upon Zenith's business during the four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="8660.169" offset="34744090">Now, what does the record show, incidentally, as to Canada after the 1957 releases?</text>
            <text syncTime="8667.175" offset="34772093">It shows, yes, as Mr. McConnell says, it shows that there was a trade builder ad in August 1958 warning about infringement, but it also shows that Mr. Wright sent a telegram and a letter, a very strong letter, to the Canadian pool and said "we are fully licensed under all Canadian patents which the pool controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="8697.549" offset="34893615">Thus, we consider this advertisement detrimental and, if you ever send another one or issue another one, we'll see you in Court."</text>

            <text syncTime="9085.478" offset="36445288">Mr. Wright testified as to two alleged effects of the Canadian pool and its activities during the period, and he said they had to do with the holding fact on advertising and promotion and they had an effect on the ability to get distributors.</text>
            <text syncTime="9101.508" offset="36509445">At least that is the way Zenith has characterized that testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="9105.803" offset="36526582">Now, on the first point of holding back on advertising and promotion, I submit that that point is no longer in the case because when we got Mr. Kaplan back on the stand in November 1965, we asked him about Zenith's advertising in Canada, and he said it was typical to what you would expect in the new market.</text>
            <text syncTime="9126.960" offset="36611218">In fact, he implied it was a bit larger and, further, Zenith only did a 218 in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="9133.709" offset="36638177">Shows that we're, in fact, substantial expenditures and advertising, radio, television, newspapers, magazines, billboards, you name it, they used it.</text>
            <text syncTime="9143.686" offset="36678092">The Government feels that -- has indicated that they recognize the rights that this is out of the case and we most certainly agree, but I think it should be pointed out, and the Court of Appeals took note of this fact, that this was evidence given by a witness later shown to be untrue by his own fellow executive.</text>
            <text syncTime="9172.620" offset="36793866">We turn then to the second question, that of whether or not has -- and the government, I think, put it fairly, whether or not Zenith was in fact unable to obtain a full-fledged Canadian distribution during the four-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="9188.011" offset="36855411">And, I submit, that is the crux of Zenith's entire claim as to Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="9195.303" offset="36884564">Now, Zenith asserts that Mr. Wright testified that he tried to get distributors but he had problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="9205.410" offset="36925001">He could get some at western Canada but he couldn't get them in the other portions of Canada because of the Canadian pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="9213.147" offset="36955930">But, actually, if you read Mr. Wright's testimony very closely, you will say that even though someone might get that impression, he didn't say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="9223.498" offset="36997413">He made some comments to the effect that the August 1958 trade builder ad, things of that type, would cause a serious problem of getting distributors, but he never testified that, in fact, there's a single -- that there was a single instance where he had failed to get a distributor or where a distributor had left Zenith.</text>

            <text syncTime="9261.336" offset="37148714">That may very well have been the theory that they should be awarded damages because the pool, for many years prior to that, had prevented them from building up a mature market.</text>
            <text syncTime="9271.819" offset="37190614">Of course, as we pointed out, any damage based on that theory is gone, is not relevant because of the 1956 releases.</text>

            <text syncTime="9292.461" offset="37273266">But, the fact is that, if his testimony is examined, all he said was that they could get distributors in western Canada.</text>

            <text syncTime="9368.304" offset="37576600">One of the questions before us on this branch of the case could be phrased this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="9374.267" offset="37600423">Was there a basis for the Trial Court concluding that, on account of threats by the pool to prevent the importation into Canada of products, Zenith products manufactured in the United States, Zenith was unable -- Zenith was deterred, prohibited, prevented, or -- from shipping its products into Canada and selling those products there, number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="9411.651" offset="37749948">Number two, because of the activities of the pool in Canada, the distributor that Zenith was unable to obtain a full-fledge distribution system, as you have put it, and that Zenith -- And, third, that was an adequate basis for a District Court conclusion that Zenith wanted to and, but four of the activities of the pool either with respect to prohibiting forbidding importation or with respect to threats against distributors, Zenith would have distributed and sold its product in Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="9458.911" offset="37938970">Should not about what it comes down to in this branch of the case?</text>
            <text syncTime="9464.098" offset="37959764">You've got two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="9465.127" offset="37963839">One, the pool or the finding 29 with respect to the pool activities in prohibiting importation of product made in the United States and, two, the distribution system.</text>
            <text syncTime="9483.480" offset="38037295">And, either of those at this remote distance, I suggest to you, arguably might support a finding that the pool has damaged Zenith in violation of the antitrust laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="9621.770" offset="38590464">Now, I would like then to come back to this matter of alleged inability to get distributors.</text>
            <text syncTime="9630.393" offset="38624946">Now, the Solicitor General in his brief recognized that the proof on this issue, I believe he recognized that it was lacking or certainly of very low standard, and he made the comment "no person can be certain whether Zenith would've been able to obtain a Canadian wide group of distributors notwithstanding the pool."</text>
            <text syncTime="9658.713" offset="38738213">He made that as a comment and as a justification and as an argument for possibly supporting the decision of the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="10304.942" offset="41323186">And, I must do so very briefly and make only the points as quickly as I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="10314.186" offset="41360071">First, that Hazeltine Corporation, the parent, was never named a party to the litigation, was never served of the process, never filed an appearance, and the litigation was solely between Hazeltine research and Zenith Radio.</text>
            <text syncTime="10331.260" offset="41428407">The only purported basis for holding the parent liable was the stipulation entered into May 7, 1963 and, as Mr. McConnell himself said this morning, that stipulation was between the parties, namely Hazeltine Research and Zenith, and Hazeltine Corporation was never a party to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="10354.270" offset="41520462">And, it should be noticed also that in the counterclaim filed in this case which was some-three weeks after the stipulation, although Zenith referred to Hazeltine Corporation as the parent, it never named it as a party and, in fact, in the claim for judgment for treble damages, a judgment was asked only -- a judgment against counter-defendant Hazeltine Research, never Hazeltine Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="10380.042" offset="41623489">Now, the fact is also that both Zenith and the Trial Court knew that Hazeltine Corporation was not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="10388.221" offset="41656299">Zenith, in its brief constantly distinguished between the parent and the subsidiary, said that Mr. Dodds represented the subsidiary, not the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="10397.092" offset="41691721">The trial judge himself, in a colloquy, when I raised the question that Hazeltine Corporation was not a party, what did Judge Austin say?</text>
            <text syncTime="10405.264" offset="41724426">"Well, of course, Hazeltine Corporation wasn't a party to the lawsuit."</text>
            <text syncTime="10411.022" offset="41747414">That's the trial judge speaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="10414.422" offset="41761102">Now, finally, and I think this is really very significant in this picture, the first time Hazeltine Corporation even knew that there was any thought that it was to be bound by the judgments, was the day after the original findings calling for the enormous award of $49 million were entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="10433.600" offset="41837798">And then, Hazeltine Corporation heard about it over a Doll Jones tape to the effect that Zenith counsel has advised that he intends to ask the Hazeltine Corporation be bound by the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="10447.962" offset="41895267">The reason for this, I suggest, is obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="10450.423" offset="41905089">These findings for $49 million were 15-16-times the network of Hazeltine Research, in fact, substantially greater than the total assets of Hazeltine Corporation and its subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="10462.276" offset="41952528">But at least, Hazeltine Corporation had more assets that Hazeltine Research and, therefore, Zenith decided at that point that the judgment should be asserted against the parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="10479.035" offset="42019506">They succeeded in getting the Trial Court to do that, even though the Trial Court himself had admitted that Hazeltine Corporation wasn't a party to the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="10501.723" offset="42110307">I -- Your Honor, I see I still have a moment more of time, but I would ask if anyone has any questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="10509.729" offset="42142281">I've hurried to finish within my time.</text>
            <text syncTime="10514.597" offset="42161716">Unless has any, I shall sit down.</text>

            <text syncTime="10548.504" offset="42297344">After this case had been submitted, and we've heard about the findings being entered, Hazeltine entered the findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="10561.303" offset="42348544">They presented complete findings of every aspect in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="10568.912" offset="42379055">And, in those findings, time after time after time, they asked the Trial Court to approve Hazeltine Corporation's entry into the pools, the use of their patents in the pools, that there was no illegal use of Hazeltine Corporation's patents, foreign patents, and Hazeltine Research, Inc. had no foreign patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="10599.334" offset="42500681">They were the patents of Hazeltine Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="10602.641" offset="42513951">If they had entered those findings, I couldn't have said one single word about their not being res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="10611.540" offset="42549582">I was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="10613.068" offset="42555643">They presented them.</text>
            <text syncTime="10614.611" offset="42561808">We'd stipulated that the companies were the same and they were there asking for relief from that Court, and it was owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="10624.664" offset="42602036">You talk about the findings being written, but they wrote findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="10629.345" offset="42620740">The Court asked both sides to present findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="10633.797" offset="42638608">They wrote them.</text>
            <text syncTime="10635.152" offset="42643937">We wrote them.</text>
            <text syncTime="10636.394" offset="42648952">And, the Court entered our findings and it's done and approved by the Court of Appeals in the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="10644.539" offset="42681553">Further than that, all of their officials were there during the whole course of the trial and knew that the two companies were stipulated to be one and the same, and that Hazeltine was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="10657.713" offset="42734216">Their counsel for the parent cor -- company trying to justify their participation in these pools, trying to get a complete bill of health from the District Court on their violation of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="10677.743" offset="42814360">And, there isn't the slightest question in the world about that and the rule is that a party that comes in and asks relief from a Court submits itself to the jurisdiction of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="10691.108" offset="42867754">Not only that, this isn't a case where a judgment was entered against somebody who wasn't there, off in a left field somewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="10703.327" offset="42916655">They came into the Court before a judgment was entered and they raised the contention that we're not bound by what's going on in this Court, and they raised the question of whether or not the submission that these findings brought them into the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="10719.077" offset="42979662">And, they lost on that issue and the District Court said they were in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="10723.908" offset="42998993">True, he referred to the stipulation, but here we were dealing with a situation in the stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="10733.137" offset="43035878">And, why was the stipulation entered?</text>
            <text syncTime="10735.275" offset="43044446">We don't have to speculate about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="10738.808" offset="43058552">They presented a stipulation in which they said, for the purposes of this suit, these two companies are to be considered the same, and why?</text>
            <text syncTime="10749.633" offset="43101915">They spelled it out, to avoid the necessity of looking through the corporate veil from the subsidiary to the parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="10762.176" offset="43152071">That was why.</text>
            <text syncTime="10763.295" offset="43156564">So, he wouldn't have to go into the -- I could've made the proof that they were -- one was the agent of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="10769.224" offset="43180283">One was the alter ego of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="10773.028" offset="43195434">No problem of proof, they were there.</text>
            <text syncTime="10776.400" offset="43209017">This isn't a case where you're trying to hold somebody who wasn't there.</text>
