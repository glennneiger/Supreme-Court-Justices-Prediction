            <text syncTime="50.266" offset="347948">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="53.016" offset="358920">This case presents two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.601" offset="369264">The first issue is whether the plaintiff, Monfort of Colorado, in seeking to prevent the acquisition by one of its rivals, Excel Corporation, of another of its rivals, Spencer Beef, established the kind of injury to itself necessary to support relief under Section 16 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.548" offset="445019">The second issue is whether the acquisition could be thought substantially to lessen competition under the standards this Court has employed in applying Section 7's prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.320" offset="488174">Under this Court's decision in the Brunswick case, these two issues necessarily are interrelated, analytically, and in light of the purposes of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.628" offset="529343">In Brunswick, the Court held that a damages plaintiff, in order to get relief, must establish that his injury will flow from the anticompetitive effects of the act he challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.935" offset="578557">In other words, the plaintiff's theory and proof of violation must be congruent with his theory and proof of injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.505" offset="608859">The injury must flow from what makes the act in question unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.409" offset="628503">All of the purposes that the Brunswick requirement was intended to serve apply just as much under Section 16 as they do under Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.681" offset="669568">The basic purpose of the Brunswick rule was to assure that the antitrust remedies are invoked and are deployed in circumstances that serve the pro-competitive purposes of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.124" offset="723380">In Section 16 actions quite as much, and perhaps even more, than Section 4 actions this purpose is implicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.512" offset="752951">Indeed, in Section 16 actions, if the injunction can be applied to what may he pro-competitive conduct, the public loses the benefit of that enhanced competition altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.855" offset="806241">In this case, exactly that problem is revealed by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.759" offset="829855">And the rulings below would allow that danger to take place, and disserve the purposes of the antitrust laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="1251.025" offset="5150926">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.250" offset="5191886">The Court of Appeals recognized in this case that a competitor cannot legitimately object to the merger of two of its rivals on the ground that the merger will reduce competition and raise prices, but because, the Court of Appeals said, the competitor would surely benefit from such a transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.246" offset="5271821">The transaction might violation Section 7, and consumers or customers... here, we're talking about customers like Safeway and A &amp; P... customers might have... would have standing to challenge a merger on that ground; but not competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.725" offset="5345800">Let me answer the question that I think was implicit in some of the questions addressed to Mr. Carr, which is, why shouldn't we let any interested person, particularly, a well informed competitor, challenge a merger on the ground that it will reduce competition?</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.984" offset="5410792">First, the statute, Section 16, says that the plaintiff must allege threatened loss or damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.006" offset="5446841">And this Court said as long ago as the Borden case in 1954 that this must be of a sort personal to the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.429" offset="5480592">Perhaps more important, though, the statute was wise, because there's a real fox-guarding-the-henhouse problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.320" offset="5520089">The competitors' incentive is to favor mergers that will decrease competition and raise prices, and to oppose mergers that will increase competition and lower prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.996" offset="5578812">And if the only person opposing a merger is a competitor, as here, that's probably because his instinct tells him the merger will intensify competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.269" offset="5623952">And I mean no respect to overworked District judges when I say that the competitor's informed instinct may be more reliable than the outcome of a trial full of economists' charts on whether... on issues as elusive as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.164" offset="5691557">Monfort in fact brought this case because it feared intensified competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.635" offset="5717366">Mr. Monfort testified on direct examination eloquently on the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.087" offset="5735233">He said, IBP decides they want to stay number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.657" offset="5753519">Excel decides they want to be number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.524" offset="5760938">They simply increase their production by working Saturdays, by being very aggressive in the marketplace, and that without ever talking to each question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.528" offset="5793016">Question: Do you believe this would occur if this acquisition is approved?</text>

            <text syncTime="1456.555" offset="5973052">But how do you find a rule of law in the statute that says competitors can't sue?</text>

            <text syncTime="1887.737" offset="7697761">Before turning to the question of standing, I'd like to take just a moment to describe why this suit was brought and what, substantively, is at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.896" offset="7754394">Monfort brought this suit because Mr. Monfort believed the acquisition seriously would affect competitive conditions in the beef packing industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.936" offset="7798593">Monfort's father had been a cattle feeder since the 1920s.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.823" offset="7818133">The company went into the beef packing business in the early 1960s.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.775" offset="7833911">As the industry moved through a period of transition following, inefficient firms disappeared, and efficient firms, including Monfort, survived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.214" offset="7875707">A leading firm, IBP, emerged; a second leading firm, Excel, assumed a strong second position; both with resources vastly in excess of those of my client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.021" offset="7926907">By 1983, when this suit was brought, this was a no-growth industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.108" offset="7951253">It had gone through a period of transition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.727" offset="7961806">It had stabilized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.910" offset="7966508">And it was not growing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.662" offset="7973509">Monfort perceived that this acquisition would significantly increase the power of Excel, and would result in the leading companies becoming even more dominant than they previously had been.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.820" offset="8026172">He saw that future growth in this industry would not be due to efficiencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.974" offset="8046757">He believed that the increased market power created in Excel by this acquisition would ultimately force his company out of business not because it was less efficient but because it had fewer... far fewer... financial resources than the dominant firms.</text>

            <text syncTime="2013.832" offset="8202237">Following the acquisition here, Excel would have a very substantially increased market share, something over 20 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.723" offset="8241734">It would also have the enormous financial resources of its parent and related companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.425" offset="8264513">And thirdly, and most importantly, it would have the intent, which we demonstrated, to take market share from particularly its smaller rivals, of whom my client is one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.166" offset="8311534">And lastly, what this acquisition did for Excel was to give it plants in a geographic location where it could, and indeed as the District Court found, there was a distinct possibility that it would, target one of my client's plants for selective price cutting, below-cost pricing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2896.470" offset="11732739">Now, as one of the members of the Court suggested, there really isn't anything in the language of Section 7 that says you can draw a distinction between permitting or a competitor or a supplier or a consumer to bring this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.110" offset="11783312">And I quite agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.377" offset="11788327">The notion, however, that the government advances here is that somehow allowing a competitor to bring a suit will cause all manner of spurious suits is simply belied by the record that we cite; the fact that there have been, I guess, a half a dozen competitor lawsuits in the last several years out of 5,000 or thereabouts acquisition transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.845" offset="11886234">There really are all manner of tools that courts use everyday... Rule 11, Rule 12, Rule 56... to deal with anything that is perceived to be an abusive suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2955.156" offset="11967527">The other point that I think deserves making, and it is noted in the briefs, and that is, there really are only two issues before this Court, in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.845" offset="12006188">The first is, do we have standing to bring a suit?</text>

            <text syncTime="2971.766" offset="12033878">And the second point is: Did we prove a violation of Section 7?</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.152" offset="12055508">It is a fact that the Tenth Circuit did not review the finding of threatened injury.</text>
