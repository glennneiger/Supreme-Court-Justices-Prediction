            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="71.080" offset="425039">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="75.939" offset="444474">In 1966, and again in 1984, Congress restructured and rationalized the law relating to pretrial detention of persons accused of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.199" offset="493480">The guiding principles of that restructuring was, first of all, to minimize the amount of pretrial detention; and subsidiary to that, to make sure... and I quote from the statute here... that a judicial officer may not impose a financial condition that results in pretrial detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.923" offset="592327">Now, complementary to that principle was a second principle, that in a defined class of serious charges, where it is found on facts established by clear and convincing evidence that no conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required, and the safety of any other person in the community, there shall be detention prior to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.522" offset="702773">Factors guiding such a decision are set out, and the judgment of the court must be supported by reasons given in writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.955" offset="752510">Now, the legislative history... and most observers agree that prior to the enactment of this 1984 provision, the very same purposes, the purposes of protecting the community were accomplished sub rosa by the setting of, in effect, impossibly high bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.117" offset="841117">The purpose of this statute was to accomplish this same purpose, the purpose of protecting the community against pretrial criminality by those who have been indicted, by a frank and fair and open proceeding, which puts it out all on the table, and allows an open discussion under legislatively defined terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.964" offset="960549">In this case, the respondents were charged with crimes of violence, and ordered detained after two lengthy hearings in which it was found by, and I quote the court, overwhelming evidence that they were lethally dangerous; that if returned to the street they would continue business as usual; and that business involved frequent episodes of murder and mayhem.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.016" offset="1076742">Now, these findings and the procedure, and the length of detention suffered here are not an issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.886" offset="1116239">This case presents one stark proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.134" offset="1137241">It is said by the Court of Appeals below that a mere prediction or concern for dangerousness cannot, consistently with substantive due process, justify detention of an adult charged with crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.033" offset="1208817">Detention, by reason of feared criminality, can only be effected by trial and conviction by the usual processes of criminal law... this is the Court of Appeals' proposition, as it was the proposition of Judge Newman in the Melendez-Carrion case on which the Court of Appeals relied heavily.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.868" offset="1296170">Now, Chief Judge Feinberg, in his dissent, sharpened this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.897" offset="1324278">He put this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.240" offset="1329607">A member of a terrorist organization has been indicted for blowing up an airliner for political reasons, and there is clear and persuasive evidence that he will do so again if not confined.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.828" offset="1395958">That is the case Judge Feinberg put.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.452" offset="1410482">And the Court of Appeals' answer was clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.058" offset="1424902">The Court of Appeals stated: Even the risk of serious crime, such as destruction of an airliner, must under our Constitution be guarded against by surveillance of the suspect and prompt trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.943" offset="1484461">I would suppose that it is an inevitable corollary of the Court of Appeals' proposition that even if such an accused should be apprehended again, in some fresh act of violence, he would once again have to be released and remain at large until finally tried and convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.622" offset="1571187">Now, what justifies so extreme and counter-intuitive a proposition?</text>
            <text syncTime="365.119" offset="1601176">First of all, no authority of this Court plainly holds that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.977" offset="1624582">Respondents, although not the Court of Appeals, argue that the detention here is punitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.817" offset="1651958">Now, there is no doubt that the detention is incapacitive, and that punitive detention also is.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.468" offset="1690515">But if all detention were punitive, then the detention of juveniles, of deportable aliens, of persons thought to be associated with the enemy in wartime, of insane persons, would also be punitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.557" offset="1750910">And it's quite plain that that is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.634" offset="1763240">Punishment is pain or disability inflicted for a past offense in order to exact retribution or to make an example of the offender.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="418.302" stopTime="460.066">
            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="418.302" offset="1813917">But in fact, General Fried, to go back to your terrorist example, had the same situation, except he isn't arrested for a past offense yet; he has just gone around saying, I am going to blow up an airline.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.151" offset="1897300">Now, you acknowledge that in that situation, this legislation would not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.414" offset="1922378">There would be no way to detain the individual unless and until he commits an offense for which he's arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.286" offset="1949858">That's what causes... that's what produces the argument that there has to be some punitive element to this detention.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_fried" startTime="460.066" stopTime="756.384">
            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="460.066" offset="1980892">That is correct, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.877" offset="1988206">And in fact, there are even more telling examples which, if you like, put it to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.873" offset="2020180">Judge Newman put the case of a person who has been acquitted on a technicality of some such offense, and at the trial it was perfectly clear that this is an extremely dangerous person who has done very bad things; or a person who has served his sentence and is now free.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.911" offset="2116311">Now, I think all of those cases make the point about what kind of a statute this is.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.734" offset="2159569">This is a statute which is intended to be ancillary to... it is clearly auxilliary to... the normal working of the criminal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.353" offset="2210038">It's like the usual detention of a person who it is feared might flee, or might intimidate witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.976" offset="2248595">This is not... this is not a free standing attempt to supplant or to have a predictive regime replace the normal criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.843" offset="2312020">The criminal charge is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.656" offset="2319334">And this is a way of dealing with a problem in the interim.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.873" offset="2336157">It's not a independent way of getting at dangerous people.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.542" offset="2366877">Now, the Court of Appeals did not find this to be a punitive... a punitive statute or to have a punitive purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.503" offset="2430720">Rather it was found to be regulatory in much the same way as the detention in Schall v. Martin was regulatory; in much the same way that the detention in Greenwood was regulatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.106" offset="2497071">And the question is: Is the regulation here justified?</text>
            <text syncTime="594.542" offset="2518805">Does the regulation not impose too heavily?</text>
            <text syncTime="598.619" offset="2535106">Is the government's justification for that regulation not insufficient?</text>
            <text syncTime="605.195" offset="2561437">That's the question which the Court of Appeals faced, and we think that is the correct question.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.036" offset="2588813">Now, there's no doubt that the burden here on the individual is indeed a heavy burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.673" offset="2615354">And there is no doubt, therefore, that the government bears a weighty burden of justifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.342" offset="2641999">Now, the respondents argue that no justification will work; that no justification is sufficient to permit the detention on account of dangerousness of an adult, competent citizen in time of peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.492" offset="2710649">Now, of course, all this line, which the respondent draws... adult, competent, time of peace, citizen not alien... what this line represents is a compendium of all of this Court's cases in which it was said that regulatory detention would be permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.858" offset="2792151">And it's not surprising, since this is a new scheme, and the Court granted certiorari to decide an issue it has not previously decided, that the line so drawn will not pass through this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.696" offset="2851501">But the principles of this Court, we think, plainly dispose of this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.366" offset="2878146">The Court of Appeals and the respondents do, I think, raise a serious and important issue about detention as regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.908" offset="2920255">They are concerned that what is undoubtedly a regulatory scheme here should not oust the familiar constitutionally structured system for redressing crime by condemnation and punishment and replace it with a forward-looking regulatory scheme of detention, however fair and procedurally nice it might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.789" offset="3015863">The picture, I suppose, that worries them is the world of the novel of the Clockwork Orange, or what happens in some other countries, which we're very glad not to live in.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.800" offset="3071870">And that is why Judge Newman's anomalies, which Justice Scalia referred to, are indeed appropriate concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.950" offset="3116487">Now, I confess that these anomalies and this concern makes me nervous too, as does the idea of displacing the criminal law as the paradigm for dealing--</text>

            <text syncTime="1062.402" offset="4390322">There is a question, of course: How are you going to calibrate the prediction?</text>

            <text syncTime="1391.743" offset="5707625">Those rebuttable presumptions have, I believe, universally been interpreted by the Courts of Appeals to simply shift the burden of going forward onto the defendant, the burden of going forward as to dangerousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.641" offset="5787246">In those Courts of Appeal, the presumption then remains in the case, as it were, as a bit of evidence, but they are not... they are not dispositive, and they have not been treated in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.853" offset="5848059">Once again, I think with a new scheme like this, it would be much better to confront the issues raised by those presumptions in a case where really they were litigated and there was a real worry about them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.316" offset="5905946">I note that the respondents, on the very last page of their brief, shrink from... it seems to me they shrink from the conclusion... that society is entirely helpless to protect itself against a determined lawbreaker who is apprehended in several acts of violence while awaiting trial.</text>

            <label>Mr. Anthony M. Cardinale</label>
            <text syncTime="1510.445" offset="6182426">May it please the Court, Justices:</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.647" offset="6195279">As I listen to General Fried's address, I must confess that I got more and more afraid of what I perceive in this issue before the Court a very great danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.360" offset="6258077">And the danger is not only to the rights of Mr. Salerno, the rights of Mr. Cafaro, but to everyone's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.468" offset="6290573">Because up until this point, I think I certainly have lived under the assumption, and have practised law under the assumption, that you got punished, you went to jail, only after the government was able, after trial, after proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, to inflict punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.833" offset="6371971">And I think that's the starting point, certainly, of our brief, and the starting point of the issues now before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.924" offset="6404363">In response to what Justice Marshall brought up about the Eighth Amendment, I submit, Your Honor, that we didn't drop the ball.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.561" offset="6446890">The Eighth Amendment is a very, very vital part of our argument in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.106" offset="6469146">It's a vital part as that right is encompassed within every defendant's due process rights, substantive due process rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.365" offset="6506136">Because they don't just deal with one simple right versus another, but embodied in the substantive due process claim that we make, and a very large part of it, is, that the Eighth Amendment must mean something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.938" offset="6568412">As this Court has pointed out in prior decisions, particularly Stack v. Boyle, where you found... and the language used there I don't believe can be termed mere dicta... but the language speaks of the right to bail in certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.103" offset="6645107">To be sure, our argument is not that there is a right to bail in each and every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.383" offset="6666214">For there is certainly historical reasons, and valid ancillary reasons, to the criminal justice system to deny bail in very extreme circumstances, and only, I submit, where the risk to society is not that there's going to be danger, or that perhaps we can predict somehow that there will be a crime committed by this individual, but only where the threat to the system is that he will not reappear, subject himself to the jurisdiction of the court, or where the actions, as we point out in our brief, the actions may demonstrate to the courts that this individual is a dangerous to particular persons who are necessary to the very operation of the particular function that the court is about to embark on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.939" offset="6888464">Now, what we say, again, if Stack v. Boyle is to mean anything, and certainly in reference to the dissents that were brought up, if the dissents in the Carlson v. Landon case are to mean anything, the Eighth Amendment is very much a part of this issue before the Court.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1712.365" stopTime="1717.536">
            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="1712.365" offset="6990133">Well, do you think that dissents in Carlson v. Landon ought to mean more than the Court opinion?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_cardinale" startTime="1717.536" stopTime="1979.041">
            <label>Mr. Anthony M. Cardinale</label>
            <text syncTime="1717.536" offset="7010822">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.504" offset="7014688">And I say that only because of the very particular facts that the Court addressed in Carlson v. Landon, facts, as we point out, and as General Fried must agree, facts that are very dispositive in their distinction with the facts before the Court and the issue before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.841" offset="7088040">In Carlson v. Landon, it wasn't a... it was not a criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.556" offset="7110923">And the Court, very easily, in those circumstances, I submit, perhaps too easily... but that's my personal view as opposed to what the jurisprudence shows... said that the Eighth Amendment in these circumstances, and bail, simply doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.458" offset="7174453">In conjunction with that, we had a very, very strong right that the Court recognized in Carlson v. Landon that the executive branch has to keep out of our country, whether by expulsion or refusal to enter, aliens; in that case, those that were deemed to be dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.262" offset="7265672">So those are the types of dispositive differences that I think are made up in each one of the examples that we have brought to this Court's attention that have, in the past, allowed for preventive detention, as it were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.973" offset="7344562">And they do not exist in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.612" offset="7355115">Schall v. Martin, we point out, I believe very aptly, is like the mental deficient cases, a situation where you have not only an admitted societal interest being propounded and enforced by the government, that is, the safety of the community, but also, a very necessary dual purpose without which, I submit, this Court would not have come to the conclusion it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.381" offset="7474234">And that dual purpose being that there was a subject of that preventive detention who was not clearly free of detentive aspects in general; it was always, as the Court has pointed out, juveniles always in some form of custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.281" offset="7533793">And in a situation where the custodial interests of the parents of this individual had somehow broken down, and it was not the duality coming in, the state's parens patria power, in conjunction with the very specific interest in protecting society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.100" offset="7625117">That duality you see throughout the only cases that this Court has ever addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.722" offset="7651553">There has always been a conjunction between not only the... the government interest in protecting society, but also the party to whom this protection was being addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.904" offset="7708291">And it deals again, with aliens, with incompetents, with juveniles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.325" offset="7721979">But it has never, and this Court has never held, that it would ever in any way, shape, or form apply to the people we describe as competent adult citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.679" offset="7775373">Now, General Fried makes a very big distinction, saying that, well, the respondents can't simply carve out a niche, a new class, that has heretofore never existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.017" offset="7832738">I somewhat agree with that analysis, but I submit to the Court that what we are talking about here is not a class that is being carved out; but we're talking about 99.999 percent of the population, and people about whom this Courthas never had to step over the line and address the issues that thiscase brings before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.850" offset="7932108">You've never had to do that when you were faced, again, with competent citizens who were adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.081" offset="7972964">And there is no effort to gerrymander, as the court puts it, the prior jurisprudence of this Court in an effort to create something that doesn't exist.</text>

            <text syncTime="3399.455" offset="13738502">There is a extensive record, extensive appendix, available for the hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.186" offset="13773401">There were two hearings before two different judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.654" offset="13791269">I don't agree with the characterization of those hearings as perfunctory.</text>

            <text syncTime="3429.290" offset="13857829">But these two motions fill two very large volumes of records.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.067" offset="13896908">If Mr. Cardinale had felt those rather extensive hearings were perfunctory, then he should have made an objection on that score, and allowed this Court to consider it on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.529" offset="13954795">Mr. Cardinale refers to, and the Court referred to, conditions of release.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.261" offset="13981754">One of the conditions of release, a mandatory condition of release, and a traditional one is, that a person released pretrial is subject to the condition that he not commit a federal, state or local crime during the period of release.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.284" offset="14061793">The case that haunts me is this: A person is released on that condition, perhaps as a result of Mr. Cardinale's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.186" offset="14105365">He then does indeed commit such a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.934" offset="14120412">What is to be done about such a person?</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.729" offset="14131592">I take it on the logic of the argument, and on the logic of the argument of the court below, he must again be released pending conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.053" offset="14180911">And if he commits yet another crime, he must again be released, until such time as there is a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.471" offset="14222603">That, I think, is a situation, describes a state of affairs, describes a mode of criminal procedure, which I don't think we are constitutionally required to admit in the face of a reasonable statute which seeks to do the opposite.</text>
