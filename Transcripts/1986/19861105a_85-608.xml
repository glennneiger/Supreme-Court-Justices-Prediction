            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="141657">We will hear argument first this morning in No. 85-608, Illinois versus Krull.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.654" offset="176243">Mr. Angarola, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="michael_j_angarola" startTime="12.891" stopTime="229.231">
            <label>Mr. Michael J. Angarola</label>
            <text syncTime="12.891" offset="193170">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue in this case is whether the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule should be applied to a warrantless search conducted pursuant to a presumptively valid statute later declared unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.333" offset="258895">Petitioners' position is that the Illinois Supreme Court erred when it required suppression of evidence seized in the search of a junkyard, thus rejecting the state's position that the exclusionary rule should not be applied where the search was made in good faith reliance of a presumptively valid statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.481" offset="331515">The Illinois statute is a comprehensive scheme regulating used auto parts and auto metal dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.568" offset="363907">That statute required that books and records be kept on the premises and that the premises of the yard, the junkyard, be available for inspection in order to determine the accuracy of the books and records of those kinds of businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.096" offset="429944">The Illinois statute has been in existence in one form or another since 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.916" offset="453246">The Illinois Supreme Court has not previously ruled on the statute but it has ruled on recordkeeping aspects of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.772" offset="484697">The facts in this case are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.558" offset="495877">On July 5th, 1981, a Chicago police officer went to the Action Iron and Metal Junkyard and there observed a towtruck bringing cars onto the premises and leaving without cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.449" offset="547391">He entered the premises and identified himself to respondent Lucas.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.650" offset="564214">He asked Lucas if the yard was open for business.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.387" offset="579156">The Chicago police officer asked to see the books and records, and he asked to see the license of the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.708" offset="604442">Lucas said he could not locate them.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.875" offset="613115">Lucas showed McNally, however, a yellow pad of paper that contained a list of approximately five vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.481" offset="643521">The Chicago police officer asked if he could go onto the yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.532" offset="659717">Lucas said go right ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.301" offset="670793">The Chicago police officer then recorded while on the yard vehicle identification numbers of cars on the yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.407" offset="699215">He checked with the computer in the squad car and determined that three of the vehicles that he observed in the yard were listed as stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.596" offset="732024">Those three vehicles were taken from the lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.548" offset="747802">A fourth vehicle which did not have any vehicle identification number on it was also taken from the lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.285" offset="774761">Thus the police officer's conduct was objectively reasonable in regard to his time of entry, the manner of entry, the fact that he identified himself, the fact that he asked if the business was open for business, the fact that he asked to see the records, and the fact that he asked to go out onto the premises of the yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.049" offset="853755">On July 6th, the day after the search in this matter, 1981, in a case unrelated to the instant search, the United States District Court held the Illinois statute unconstitutional because it did not sufficiently limit the discretion of police officers who had the authority to enforce the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.160" offset="922196">On September 25th, 1981, respondents filed a motion to suppress which was sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.997" offset="949572">The Illinois Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.116" offset="962111">In affirming the trial court the Illinois Supreme Court erroneously applied the Court's case of Michigan versus DeFillippo cited at 443 US, a 1979 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.991" offset="1009549">DeFillippo is distinguishable from the instant case because the DeFillippo case involved the question of whether a Detroit ordinance later found unconstitutional, could form the basis of probable cause to arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.881" offset="1057092">Secondly--</text>

            <text syncTime="232.933" offset="1073288">Is it not correct that by the time the case reached the Illinois Supreme Court Judge Schader's order in the Federal Court had already been vacated and set aside, and so the Supreme Court of Illinois had to make its own determination of the the constitutionality of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.276" offset="1130757">It didn't just rely on the Federal decision, but it was in this very case that the statute was held unconstitutional.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="294.888" offset="1321138">So the question, what you are really asking us to do is to say not to apply the exclusionary rule in the case in which the constitutionality of the statute itself is challenged and found invalid.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_j_angarola" startTime="305.410" stopTime="406.860">
            <label>Mr. Michael J. Angarola</label>
            <text syncTime="305.410" offset="1363247">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.446" offset="1379339">The search that occurred in the DeFillippo case was a search incident to an arrest, and the search presently before the Court involves a warrantless entry onto the premises of a closely regulated business.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.104" offset="1426046">The exclusionary rule is meant to further a logical public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.258" offset="1450601">That public policy is to deter police misconduct by applying the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.261" offset="1470663">You can't deter police misconduct by applying the exclusionary rule to possible mistakes by the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.417" offset="1499293">United States versus Leon allowed a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule where a search which was later found defective was executed and evidence was seized where the officers acted in good faith reliance on the search warrant and that court determined that the standard of reasonableness was an objective standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.295" offset="1570764">The statute of the sort here where the warrantless entry onto the premises of a closely regulated business is allowed, the statute stands in the place of a warrant, but the Leon court said that where some limitations on the officer's good faith reliance... excuse me, that there were some limitations on the officer's good faith reliance on a search warrant, and Leon listed three examples of those limitations, that when affidavits for a search warrant contain reckless falsities or when a magistrate abandons his neutral role, or when the affidavits do not provide a substantial basis for the existence of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.933" offset="1705347">Thus this Court recognized some limitations to those search warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.754" offset="1728648">Those three factors articulated in Leon state a reasonableness standard, and such a standard could be applied to situations where a statute stands in the place of a warrant.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="406.860" offset="1769086">Mr. Angarola, what do you make of Footnote 8 in Leon dealing with this particular problem?</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael J. Angarola</label>
            <text syncTime="415.715" offset="1804508">Footnote 8, dealing with the DeFillippo or the cases of Ubara, Torres?</text>
            <text syncTime="424.773" offset="1840661">Your Honor, those cases deal with statutes that provided that there either was no need for probable cause or there was no need for aspects of a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.831" offset="1896981">Here our situation is distinguishable because we are dealing with a closely regulated type business or a pervasively regulated type business, a category of businesses that this Court has recognized as to allowing statutes to stand in the place of search warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.375" offset="1963123">So I think that the situations here are different than the Torres case, which was, of course, a statute that required people traveling from the United States into Puerto Rico to have their luggage searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.100" offset="2010039">There was no requirement of probable cause in that case, and there was no establishment or need for a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.354" offset="2038983">The legislature there was attempting to enact a provision which would eliminate the need for a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.158" offset="2062284">It is not in this pervasively regulated businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.210" offset="2074405">Therefore it was something improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.578" offset="2083913">In Ubara, the State of Illinois had a statute which provided for the search of all persons present at a location where a search warrant was executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.535" offset="2127695">There again, this Court found that because the Illinois legislature in this case was attempting to enact the provision that eliminated probable cause, that those were improper statutes, and those statutes were unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="524.787" offset="2240753">The point is that the officers acting in good faith and having good faith reliance on a statute is the significant controlling fact, and the fact whether the statute is constitutional or not is not important to our position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.314" offset="2306895">In other words, it of course should be considered.</text>

            <text syncTime="559.110" offset="2378052">Here, in this instance, because we are discussing these pervasively regulated businesses, closely regulated businesses, an area where this Court has allowed statutes to stand in the place of warrants, I think that those cases are distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.386" offset="2435104">I think the substantive effect of what this Court did in Ubara and Torres would remain the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.873" offset="2461121">If this Court were to consider a good faith exception where police officers act in reliance upon a statute, a presumptively valid statute, the result might change, but the substantive holding of those cases would remain the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="982.770" offset="4072668">There were no findings made in this case whether or not Detective McNally's conduct was objectively reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.389" offset="4095133">The reason was both the trial court and the Illinois Supreme Court believed they were not allowed to make those types of findings because both courts concluded that the good faith exception that this Court adopted in Leon should not be extended to this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.732" offset="4148527">So, since they decided the threshold question against the state there was no need or reason for them to go on and make these types of findings, but they wouldn't have to be findings as to the officer's subjective intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1057.152" offset="4370255">--No, because the benefits of bringing a suppression motion, as the Court recognized in Leon, are the termination of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.973" offset="4393451">So even if viewed outside the judicial system, it would be clear that a judge should rule in the government's favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.143" offset="4418215">The defense counsel is not going to be certain of that and he will still bring his motion, but in addition, in statutes like this you have the possibility of challenging the statute in ways that you don't have in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.982" offset="4457504">For example, a declaratory judgment proceeding can be brought, and that can be brought early on and before the searches are executed, so it is possible to have the substantive rules of Fourth Amendment law in a case where there is a statute rather than a warrant authorizing the conduct to be clearly defined perhaps even before any search occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.277" offset="4522705">So in that case if the decision is clearly settled that it is permissible or not, then you have an entirely different type of calculus that goes into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.881" offset="4557082">The two substantive... the two central principles that this Court adopted in Leon we believe control this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.870" offset="4585086">The first is that the purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter police misconduct, and the second and related one is that the exclusionary rule will not serve that purpose where a police officer acts in an objectively reasonable fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.260" offset="4630643">In those circumstances the officer acts as any other officer would, and imposing the remedy of exclusion penalizes the officer and the government without producing any corresponding benefit to the privacy interest protected by the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.918" offset="4681321">Now, although the question in this case involves the application of those principles that were adopted in Leon to a slightly different factual situation, we believe those principles are fully controlling here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.108" offset="4722072">That, I believe, is clear when you look at the question from the perspective of the officer attempting to execute the search.</text>

            <text syncTime="2401.333" offset="9746986">It doesn't depend on the law being slightly unconstitutional or very unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="2412.491" offset="9791603">I have to say that is true, Your Honor, because to the... now, that doesn't mean in your example that we have to find the whole statute unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.014" offset="9821696">We can say this portion of the statute is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.366" offset="9835071">You can continue to operate under the rest of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.067" offset="9845833">And then all the legislature has to do, Mr. Justice, is to reenact that portion of the statute and make it constitutional, and then the issue disappears.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.327" offset="9906960">I would reemphasize that there can be no objective good faith reliance on a procedural statute which is crafted by the legislature to violate the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.919" offset="9965265">And when a police officer acts beyond the limited authority of the regulatory inspection scheme on his frolic and detour he is relying on no statute whatsoever, and the issue of good faith is inapposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.346" offset="10027019">The officer is merely acting indiscriminately, and that perhaps is the best reason why the Court should not reach the constitutional issue in this case, because this officer was indeed acting indiscriminately.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.487" offset="10075502">He was not acting within good faith because he did not comply with the requirements even of the unconstitutional regulatory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.961" offset="10117402">Also, again, I would point out that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule has only been defined within the context of a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.650" offset="10156168">For the Court to extend it beyond the context of a warrant would, I think, take it out of the context in which it is currently defined.</text>

            <text syncTime="2601.195" offset="10546437">But again, this results in widespread abuses whereas that situation I think the Court recognizes that a magistrate may make an error in judgment as to a probable cause determination but that it the warrant is still required, the exercise of determining probable cause is still required, and in our circumstance we have abrogated those requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.743" offset="10636612">You are in essence saying that if the state enacts an unconstitutional statute and authorizes a warrantless search which this Court has determined is per se unreasonable, the evidence must be excluded when it violates the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2655.532" offset="10763776">The legislature's judgment should be entitled to deference just as a judge's judgment regarding the execution of search warrants should be given deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.541" offset="10819783">There is no reason that this Court should desire a public policy that would require police to be timid in their execution of search warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.313" offset="10862833">This Court, of course, has dealt with a public policy called the exclusionary rule for some time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.817" offset="10888850">The question is is whether that public policy should be such so that police officers acting in good faith reliance upon the existence of a statute should have evidence that is seized suppressed in court, and the question is whether that public policy should be greater than a public policy of, for example, requiring police officers to enforce statutes as they know them to be.</text>

            <text syncTime="2783.662" offset="11276299">If criminal charges occur there can be judicial review in the form of a motion to suppress, and that judicial review should be the same, I would think, to respond to Justice O'Connor's question, whether it is a motion to suppress that is filed pursuant to a search that occurred regarding a statute or whether that is regarding the execution of a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.794" offset="11368772">Citizens can express their views to legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.079" offset="11381938">Proposed legislation can be reviewed by legislative bodies themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.466" offset="11399492">They can be reviewed by Bar Association committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.918" offset="11409314">They can be viewed by the Governor of the state, and in Illinois the Governor has the authority to mandatorily veto statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.989" offset="11437526">Thus there is a significant amount of degree of review of proposed legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.094" offset="11470023">So citizens in fact have more avenue of redress and more avenues to express their views regarding statutes than they do regarding the execution of a search warrant.</text>
