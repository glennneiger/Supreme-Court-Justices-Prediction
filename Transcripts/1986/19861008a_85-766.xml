            <label>Mr. Elliot F. Gerson</label>
            <text syncTime="56.253" offset="378596">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case involves a conflict between Section 9-431 of the Connecticut General Statutes which requires that persons be enrolled members of a political party when they vote in that party's primary election, and a rule adopted by the Republican Party of the State of Connecticut that would, contrary to that state law, allow unaffiliated voters to vote in Republican primaries for United States Senate, United States House of Representatives, Governor, and certain other state executive offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.615" offset="556019">The rule would not, however, apply to other elective offices in the state, including state house and state senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.102" offset="586008">The issues in this appeal are whether this law, which sets voter qualifications in a major party state primary is unconstitutional simply because a state party adopts a conflicting rule, and whether the particular rule adopted by the appellee party in this case is itself violative of Article 1, Section 2, and the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.705" offset="700424">When Connecticut enacted its primary electoral scheme, which has now been in effect for greater than 30 years, the legislature thoroughly debated the implications of the various electoral codes that had already been adopted in the various states.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.131" offset="762073">Connecticut, in fact, was one of the last states to adopt a primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.916" offset="777224">The legislature selected a system that recognized the important role played by major political parties in the electoral and governmental process.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.241" offset="822573">The legislature sought, while opening up the process to the party rank and file, to at the same time maintain party responsibility and accountability by limiting participation in primary voting to party members.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.917" offset="885267">The legislature thus struck a balance between a convention system and a wide open direct primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.089" offset="913897">Simply stated, the law in this case allows a candidate of a major party in Connecticut who obtains 20 percent of a roll call vote at a party convention to wage a primary in which all party members may participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.182" offset="978262">Connecticut law further provides for automatic and preferential ballot access for major parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.705" offset="1008356">The primaries in Connecticut are financed by the state and its towns and administered by the state and its towns, and enrollment is a very simple process involving completion of a short form up to noon the last business day before the primary.</text>

            <text syncTime="369.305" offset="1630801">The basic points I wish to discuss today may be simply stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.157" offset="1650236">First, that this case does not involve the merely internal affairs of a private association, but rather the public electoral functions of a major political party, that the state has a real and substantial interest in assuring the accountability and responsibility of the major political parties in view of the party's major governmental and electoral roles, that the decision of the Court of Appeals and particularly the analysis and the test that it employs have profound implications for the electoral codes of Connecticut and all the other states, and we also wish to demonstrate in the particular context of the rule adopted in this state the significant administrative burdens that would be imposed on Connecticut's electoral officials if this rule were in fact implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.923" offset="1845319">Fourth, that there is no real showing of any injury to the constitutional right of appellees that this statute has caused.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.945" offset="1881368">The state is merely regulating appellees' interaction with people who do not want to join them in membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.051" offset="1913760">And finally, we will argue that the rule itself in this case is unconstitutional as violative of Article 1, Section 2 and the Seventeenth Amendment of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.692" offset="1960362">First, we wish to stress that this case does not involve the merely internal affairs of a private association or a private debating society, but rather the public electoral function of a major political party.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.683" offset="2016264">Major political parties dominate the electoral process, dominate the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.503" offset="2039565">As a practical matter, the choices that voters will have as to who will govern them are made when the major parties nominate their candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.294" offset="2078749">Accordingly, people have a right to say through their elected representatives how those people are selected and what electoral system best promotes governmental goals.</text>

            <text syncTime="572.238" offset="2442478">The state in no way regulates the nominating process of those minor parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="1581.940" offset="6481322">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, there are two fundamental disagreements between the parties on the issues in this lawsuit, and one is involved with the questions that Justice O'Connor was just asking Mr. Gerson about the nature of the freedom of association issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.305" offset="6574840">And the state in its argument today has characterized it as one based on membership, that it is an attempt to force people who don't want to become members to participate without assuming the mantle of membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.280" offset="6626667">That is not the freedom of association issue that we rely on solely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.101" offset="6645998">It is true we want them to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.917" offset="6653208">It is true that the Republican Party has adopted this rule in the ultimate hope that independent voters will become members of the party in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.957" offset="6685391">But the reason the rule is adopted goes beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.492" offset="6699497">The reason the rule was adopted is because whether or not independent voters become members of the party, their numbers are so great in the State of Connecticut they outnumber the number of Republicans significantly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.649" offset="6748189">The present numbers are 700,000 Democrats, 600,000 independents, and 475,000 Republicans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.405" offset="6783193">Whether or not those independent voters become members of the party, their participation, whether through a formal affiliation or an informal affiliation in party affairs, their participation in supporting party candidates at an early stage, their participation in helping the party select candidates with enough popular support to win general elections by getting other independent support or even support from other groups, those kinds of feelings were what prompted the Republican Party to adopt this rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="3384.773" offset="13692685">The holding in Oregon against Mitchell relied on Congress's power under Article 1 to override a determination by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.379" offset="13735108">The pertinent opinion in Oregon against Mitchell that relates to the state's position here is Justice Stewart's opinion that was joined by Justice Blackmun and Chief Justice Burger which stated very clearly that the states are not free to prescribe qualifications for voters in Federal elections which differ from those prescribed for the more numerous branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.375" offset="13819118">In this case the qualifications differ.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.077" offset="13829880">Article 1, Section 2, and the Seventeenth Amendment invalidate it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3426.933" offset="13861332">It invalidates it very simply because many voters in Republican primaries in Connecticut for Senate and House of Representatives would lack the qualifications for voting in Republican primaries for the Connecticut State House of Representatives.</text>
