            <label>Ms. Maureen Phelan</label>
            <text syncTime="53.718" offset="349667">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="56.920" offset="362415">This case is here today on a petition... or for a writ, rather, of certiorari to the Colorado Supreme Court, which did suppress a statement made by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.477" offset="408704">I will very briefly summarize the facts, and then I'll explain why the court below misconstrued this Court's decision in Miranda v. Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.750" offset="445798">And I would like to point out that in my opening brief in this Court I really did not go into all of the facts that supported the trial court's conclusion that this waiver was knowing and voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.558" offset="493027">So this is really my opportunity to get those facts out.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.878" offset="518314">Again, the case involves the validity of this Miranda waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.414" offset="532420">The facts are that the defendant here agreed to sell some stolen guns to Federal agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.068" offset="559065">They were Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents working undercover.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.953" offset="574634">He was arrested during the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.838" offset="586127">He was put into a police car, and he was given his Miranda warnings at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.475" offset="608697">In addition, he was also given an additional warning that he had the right to stop questioning at any time; and he also had the right to stop questioning for the purpose of obtaining counsel at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.551" offset="660942">He was then driven down to the local ATF offices... this was in Kansas City... and he was again given the warnings, and again, given the additional warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.507" offset="700857">At that time, he signed a written waiver, and this written waiver is included in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.977" offset="722696">It's very specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.194" offset="727607">It states that he did not want an attorney at this time; that he was willing to answer questions; that he understood what he was doing; and that no promises, threats, pressure or force had been placed upon him.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.153" offset="787375">Some of the additional factors showing that this waiver was voluntary is the fact that this defendant was 23 years old, and at the time of this transaction, had quite a lot of prior involvement with the criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.663" offset="849442">He had murdered his aunt when he was 10 years old, and shot another aunt at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.102" offset="875146">And then when he was 18 and first released from his juvenile detention, he was convicted in Iowa of a robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.624" offset="909314">About two weeks later, he was convicted also in Iowa of a forgery case.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.076" offset="927078">And a couple of years later, at the age of 20, convicted again in Iowa of robbery without aggravation.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.199" offset="959574">There's nothing in the record to show that this defendant was anything less than average intelligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.134" offset="979323">There's no indication of any sort of incompetence, no claim of any--</text>

            <label>Ms. Maureen Phelan</label>
            <text syncTime="236.468" offset="1080678">The fact... the other factors would also show there was no long, intensive interrogation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.188" offset="1103561">He spoke quite readily and quite freely with the officers when he did agree to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.692" offset="1129579">This interrogation did occur during normal business hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.561" offset="1141073">It was at 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.430" offset="1152462">He was asked during this interrogation about the gun charges, where he had obtained the guns, things of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.786" offset="1181928">And at the end of it, he was asked several questions concerning a homicide in Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.988" offset="1202722">The ATF agents knew about this homicide because the informant who had told them about the gun transactions had also told them that this defendant had admitted to them that... or had admitted to him, the informant, that he had murdered someone in Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.765" offset="1273879">Based on all of these factors, the trial court found that the defendant here was properly advised; that he was aware of his rights; that he responded freely, voluntarily and intelligently; and specifically found that there was no element of duress or coercion used against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.815" offset="1362069">The Colorado Supreme Court, however, agreed with the defendant that his waiver could not have been knowing and intelligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.219" offset="1391639">What the Colorado Supreme Court did was apply the totality of the circumstances test, and they held that his awareness that they might question him... or rather, actually, his lack of awareness that they might question him about this Colorado murder was one factor to consider in the totality of the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.298" offset="1471992">However, then the Colorado Supreme Court took that one step further and held that this was a determinative factor, because if he didn't know all of the possible subjects of interrogation, then he couldn't be aware of the consequences of his waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.708" offset="1533641">And in fact, the Colorado Supreme Court took the entire analysis another step further and held that this factor, his lack of awareness of the possible subjects of interrogation, is such an important factor that the totality of the circumstances test has to actually be applied to that sole factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.538" offset="1608978">And so it must be determined now, in Colorado, apparently in each case, whether or not the defendant understands all of the possible subjects that he could be interrogated upon after he agrees to speak with the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.596" offset="1661118">So based upon this, the Colorado Supreme Court held that this waiver was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.202" offset="1691629">And I would insert at this time that the defense has tried to raise an issue here of voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.724" offset="1725693">And although the Colorado Supreme Court's opinion is written in that classic formula of, found to be... or not proven to be knowing, intelligent and voluntary, if we look back at the Colorado Supreme Court's opinion, it's written completely in terms of, and it discusses only, the knowing and intelligent aspects of this waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.471" offset="1812629">So it's clear that the Colorado Supreme Court confused this knowing and intelligent aspects with a wise waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.260" offset="1843871">They have found that--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="432.496" offset="1864769">They confused it with some kind of a waiver, you said.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.281" offset="1875949">And I just didn't catch the adjective in front of waiver.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="maureen_phelan" startTime="437.282" stopTime="543.385">
            <label>Ms. Maureen Phelan</label>
            <text syncTime="437.282" offset="1883891">It's a wise waiver, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.317" offset="1896012">In other words, they have confused this issue of knowing and intelligent, or especially intelligent, I suspect; they think that in order to be an intelligent waiver, it has to be a wise waiver; and that the consequences that the defendant must be aware of go far beyond the consequence that his statement can and will be used against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.798" offset="1977932">It has to... he has to be aware of far-reaching circumstances surrounding his circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.571" offset="2017115">Miranda simply does not go so far by its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.926" offset="2042506">Miranda requires that the defendant makes his waiver knowing what his rights are.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.746" offset="2069778">Miranda requires that he makes his waiver knowing the consequences of waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.150" offset="2091407">And Miranda specifically states what those consequences are.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.269" offset="2103842">He must know that the State can, and will, use this statement against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.440" offset="2132576">So we would simply submit that by its terms, the Colorado Supreme Court went way too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.696" offset="2161520">Miranda has described traditional police methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.564" offset="2177089">But Miranda did not, by its own terms, actually condemn those methods, as the defendant has tried to imply in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.455" offset="2224632">What Miranda did was, describe certain traditional police interrogation methods, and then impose a balancing test on this; and has given to criminal suspects something of a shield against these traditional police interrogation methods.</text>

            <text syncTime="600.139" offset="2535385">But we have, on the opposite end of that scale, the possible risk that police will go too far in their efforts and compel admissions in violation of the Fifth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1320.096" offset="5415123">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.465" offset="5428603">I'd like to begin my remarks by addressing the questions regarding deception that were posed at the tail end of my co-counsel's argument a few moments ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.440" offset="5476563">First, a factual question raised by Justice O'Connor about what it is exactly the Supreme Court of Colorado said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.879" offset="5510314">As I recollect the opinion, Your Honor, what they said was that there's some suggestion that the police may have told respondent that their questions would be in connection with a particular subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.305" offset="5571963">The Colorado Supreme Court, I don't think, goes further than to say that that might be reflected in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.542" offset="5592965">My reading of the record suggests that there's no... not even a whisper of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.261" offset="5611878">In point of fact, the written waiver executed by respondent on March the 30, 1979, is not even in the slightest tied in to a particular crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.735" offset="5657749">And that written waiver, which acknowledged the receipt of the rights, the understanding of the rights, and the decision to waive the rights, which respondent signed, and which this Court in North Carolina v. Butler said is strong evidence that the waiver is valid, was in no respect... did in no respect incorporate any specific crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.814" offset="5750013">There's no testimony that the agents, the ATF agents, in proposing the waiver to the respondent told him that it would be in connection with a particular crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.039" offset="5794944">With all respect to the Colorado Supreme Court, I suggest that that is simply an invention that is in no respect reflected in anybody's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.478" offset="5832665">Mr. Spring, by the way, did not testify at the suppression hearing, so that point couldn't have emerged from his testimony either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.232" offset="5867669">There's simply nothing to suggest that kind of trickery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.285" offset="5879894">More fundamentally, however... and this addresses, I think, the questions posed by Justices Scalia and Stevens... it does not seem to the United States that trickery and deception within the meaning of Miranda could possibly comprehend the kind of deception and trickery that the Supreme Court of Colorado may have been averting to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.334" offset="5976129">In point of fact, respondent suggests in his brief that the agents structured their questions in such a way as to enshroud their real agenda.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.673" offset="6017507">As respondent sees it, the agents tricked him into believing that they were simply investigating a firearms case; not a homicide case; and so deceived, the respondent involuntarily waived his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.397" offset="6072364">Well, there's no disputing that under Miranda a waiver cannot be the product of trickery or deception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.235" offset="6099740">There's no quarrel about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.619" offset="6109249">But even if the failure, the simple failure, to disclose the topics of interrogation were part of a calculated effort by the agents to deceive the respondent... a conclusion, by the way, which the trial court flatly rejected, and which neither appellate court disturbed in the slightest... that is simply not the kind of deception that Miranda is talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.618" offset="6201305">As this Court held last term in Moran v. Burbine the kind of trickery that can vitiate a waiver is conduct,</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.241" offset="6235786">"that deprives a defendant of knowledge essential to his ability to understand the nature of his rights and the consequences of abandoning them. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.429" offset="6276537">I suggest that questions posed of a suspect, even if structured in such a way as to camouflage the officers' true agenda, cannot fit within this closely cabined rubric of deception as proscribed by Miranda.</text>

            <text syncTime="1568.051" offset="6406940">But I think as Moran against Burbine makes plain, Justice Scalia, consequence is a bounded concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.455" offset="6436616">It doesn't refer to every consequence that may emanate from the choice a suspect makes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.143" offset="6463365">The only consequence... the only consequence... that Miranda is intended to inform the suspect about is the simple and single consequence that anything he says can be used against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.885" offset="6518327">The respondent knew that much, and more than that, he's not entitled to know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.772" offset="6537866">It follows from this Court's explanation of the concept of deception in Moran, the kind... the limited concept of deception that Miranda forbids, that hiding the ball, as it were, in this fashion, could not be the kind of deception that Miranda forbids.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence S. Robbins</label>
            <text syncTime="1682.657" offset="6865442">Although it does seem to me that that particular case is foreclosed by certain of the decisions of this Court about misstating the nature of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.048" offset="6906924">And I think this Court catalogued some of those cases in deciding the issue of trickery in Moran v. Burbine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.153" offset="6943391">More fundamentally, it seems to me, the complaint that respondent suggests about trickery in this case, betrays an aversion to the very concept of interrogation that simply cannot be squared with what this Court has uniformly said about the necessity of conducting lawful interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.198" offset="7015594">Simply to assert, as respondent does, that the agents played their cards close to the vest during the interrogation, says no more than that they did their job well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.840" offset="7058121">Police interrogation obviously may not take the coercive forms forbidden by this Court over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.077" offset="7083094">But neither, I suggest, is it to be governed by the rules of Victorian etiquette.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.980" offset="7102738">Simply to describe police methods as deceptive substitutes metaphor for analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.717" offset="7129696">Indeed, a good deal of what constitutes effective and lawful police work is effective precisely because it is deceptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.990" offset="7166790">Wire-tapping is deceptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.692" offset="7173582">Using informants is deceptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.609" offset="7181210">Consensual monitors are deceptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.827" offset="7190092">Body recorders are deceptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.679" offset="7197510">They are all deceptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.946" offset="7206601">But when used appropriately and lawfully, there's nothing unconstitutional about them, and nothing forbidden by Miranda about them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.683" offset="7241500">Whereas here, the police did nothing that can be said to have obscured the meaning of the Miranda warnings, nor in any sense intimidated respondent into waiving them, a court has no authority, under the Constitution or under Miranda, to refuse, as the Colorado Supreme Court did, to enforce that waiver.</text>

            <text syncTime="1806.321" offset="7360096">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.677" offset="7397504">The issue presented in this case is a narrow one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.629" offset="7409311">The issue is not whether police officers, prior to questioning, must inform a suspect of all the possible subjects of interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.032" offset="7438882">Rather the issue is whether the Colorado Supreme Court, given the particular facts and circumstances of this case, where Mr. Spring was being investigated on weapons charges, and was then interrogated on a completely unrelated homicide, correctly concluded that in the totality of the circumstances, the prosecution had not met its burden of proving a valid waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.164" offset="7531460">The petitioner has given you its view of the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.950" offset="7542536">I would make the following additions and corrections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.802" offset="7558000">Early in February of 1979, John Spring was involved in the shooting death of Donald Walker in Craig, Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.740" offset="7585794">In mid-February of that year, Spring told George Dennison, of Kansas City, Missouri, about the shooting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.311" offset="7612021">In late February, Dennison contacted Harold Wactor, an agent with the Kansas City office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.583" offset="7649115">Dennison informed Wactor that Spring was involved in a plan to steal firearms, transport them interstate, and sell them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.921" offset="7678477">Dennison also informed Wactor of Spring's involvement in the Walker homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.927" offset="7702509">On March 23rd, 1979, informant Dennison set up a telephone conversation with Spring which was tape recorded by ATF agents, and during which, Spring arguably implicated himself in the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.667" offset="7757471">On March 30th, Spring was arrested in Kansas City, Missouri, curing an actual hand-to-hand sale of stolen firearms to Federal agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.542" offset="7796968">To reiterate, at the time of Spring's arrest on firearms charges, the Federal agents knew of the Colorado homicide; knew of Spring's involvement in the crime; and were in possession of a taped phone conversation in which Spring arguably implicated himself in the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.568" offset="7865096">Following his arrest, Spring was read his rights by Federal agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.206" offset="7879620">Spring waived those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.189" offset="7887561">Spring was not advised that he was a murder suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.341" offset="7900100">And as the Colorado Supreme Court noted, there was no basis to conclude that Spring could reasonably have expected that the interrogation would extend to the to the Walker murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.815" offset="7950046">Spring was questioned first about the firearms transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.119" offset="7963212">He was then asked if he had a criminal record; if he had shot anyone else; if he had been to Colorado; and finally, whether he had shot Donnie Walker west of Denver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.308" offset="8008038">As the Colorado Supreme Court noted, nothing about the interrogation, leading up to the final questions regarding Walker and Colorado, would have suggested to Spring that a topic of inquiry would be the Colorado homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.168" offset="8067492">The Colorado Supreme Court applied the totality of the circumstances test enunciated by this Court in North Carolina v. Butler, and Fare v. Michael C, in holding that Spring had not validly waived his rights with regard to the homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.744" offset="8121723">In reaching its conclusion, the court noted that at the time of the waiver on firearms charges, Spring was totally unaware, and had no reason to be aware, that he was to be questioned about the Colorado homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.568" offset="8169056">The court emphasized that the record offered little with regard to Spring's intelligence, or his acquaintance with the criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.408" offset="8204374">And just to respond to some of the comments of the petitioner, nothing in the record of the suppression hearing... nothing in the transcript of the suppression hearing indicates anything about a prior criminal record, with the exception of a juvenile record for shooting his aunt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.619" offset="8269262">So that information was not before the trial court, and I'm not sure what the source of that information is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.373" offset="8304266">The court took into account the particular circumstances surrounding the interrogation, including the fact that the Federal agents had information about a much more serious crime; withheld that information from Spring; as well as the dramatic shift in the focus of the interrogation which occurred in a misleading fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.187" offset="8379499">It thus seems clear that the court was concerned with the impact of the interrogation techniques employed, on Spring's opportunity to exercise his rights with regard to the homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.244" offset="8427773">Given all these circumstances, the Colorado Supreme Court held that the prosecution had not met its burden of proving a valid waiver with regard to the homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.568" offset="8481063">In Miranda v. Arizona, this Court held that to protect the individual's privilege against self-incrimination, concrete Constitutional guidelines must be established for police officers and for courts to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.228" offset="8531740">The Court thus held that prior to custodial interrogation, a suspect must be advised of the now-familiar Miranda warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.466" offset="8560684">Like the warnings, a suspect's waiver of his rights is indispensable to the admissibility of his statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.785" offset="8581896">This Court has held that a waiver must be knowing, intelligent and voluntary, and must be made with an understanding of the consequences of waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.058" offset="8615019">In deciding whether--</text>

            <text syncTime="2355.610" offset="9557203">Not subtle at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2373.404" offset="9628361">The court was also concerned that there was very little in the record about the defendant's background and his experience with the criminal justice system.</text>

            <text syncTime="2448.037" offset="9926888">And that is the language that the Colorado Supreme Court used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.392" offset="9960325">In the instant case, the Colorado Supreme Court held that one factor to be assessed under the totality approach is the extent to which a suspect is aware, or reasonably should be aware, of the subject matter of the interrogation prior to its commencement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.533" offset="10012883">The court specifically rejected the per se rule, which had been adopted by the Colorado intermediate court for rendering invalid any waiver where a defendant is not specifically advised by the police of the nature of the offense prior to questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.793" offset="10065964">The court held that in all such cases the proper standard for determining the validity of a waiver is the totality of the circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="2546.449" offset="10320606">The Colorado Supreme Court's decision is also supported by this Court's decision in Fare v. Michael C. In Fare, this Court, in upholding the validity of the respondent's Miranda waiver, noted that the respondent was aware that he was to be questioned about a murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.059" offset="10375045">Fare suggests that a suspect's awareness of the nature of the offense is a relevant factor under the totality of the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.947" offset="10402526">Petitioner asserts that the ruling of the Colorado Supreme Court would, in practice, require the police to take on the role of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.033" offset="10430947">According to petitioner, police officers would have to inform the suspect of possible charges, the evidence they have, the legal elements of the offense, possible defenses, likely penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.241" offset="10475773">Simply put, nothing about the Colorado Supreme Court's decision goes so far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.662" offset="10497403">Spring speaks only about the facts of this particular case, where Spring was led, by all the circumstances, to believe he would be questioned only about firearms, where ATF agents obtained a waiver with regard to that offense, but where Spring was then questioned about a totally unrelated homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.024" offset="10566888">It is also important to note that while a number of jurisdictions have adopted the totality of the circumstances approach employed by the Colorado Supreme Court in Spring, they have similarly rejected waiver challenges on the grounds suggested by petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.985" offset="10642748">In Moran v. Burbine, this Court described Miranda as an attempt to reconcile society's interest in effective law enforcement with the coercive nature of the interrogation process by giving the defendant the power to exert some control over the course of the interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.411" offset="10700426">The Colorado Supreme Court's decision in Spring recognized that on the particular facts here, where Spring was unaware that he was a homicide suspect, ATF agents were able to subtly manipulate the custodial process, and elicit incriminating information before Mr. Spring had the opportunity to make a knowing and intelligent decision to exercise his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.258" offset="10787780">The Colorado court assessed the totality of the circumstances in determining that Spring had not validly waived his rights with regard to the homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.864" offset="10822261">The court properly considered Spring's lack of awareness of the nature of the offense and its assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.418" offset="10840443">The court emphasized that the record offered little with regard to Spring's intelligence or acquaintance with the criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.322" offset="10864057">The court took into account the particular interrogation techniques employed, and apparently, their impact on Spring's opportunity to exercise his rights with regard to the homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.094" offset="10903136">Spring reveals a careful and thorough analysis of the totality of the circumstances as is required by this Court's decisions, and its decision should therefore be affirmed.</text>
