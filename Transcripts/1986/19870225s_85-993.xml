            <text syncTime="12.440" offset="141531">First of these cases, Hobbie versus Unemployment Commission, is here on appeal from the Florida District Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.972" offset="183641">Appellant Hobbie was an employee of appellee Lawton and Company a Florida jeweler.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.831" offset="215092">Hobbie's work schedule required that she work on Saturdays, but after she had been working for a while she became a convert to the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and informed her employer that she could no longer work on Saturdays, the Sabbath of the Adventist Church.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.701" offset="294504">Appellee, Lawton and Company, there upon discharged her.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.034" offset="307879">Hobbie filed a claim for unemployment compensation with the Florida Department of Labor and Employment Security.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.039" offset="339853">The claim was denied on the ground that the Florida statute disqualified her for benefits because under that statute, her discharge was for misconduct connected with her work.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.469" offset="397636">The Florida Fifth District Court of Appeals summarily affirmed rejecting Hobbie's contention that her disqualification of unemployment compensation, violated the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.006" offset="451761">We noted probable jurisdiction and we now reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.816" offset="479033">We hold that reversal is required under our decisions in Sherbert v. Verner decided in 1963, and Thomas v. Review Board decided in 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.707" offset="562521">In Sherbert, we considered South Carolina's denial of unemployment compensation to a Sabbatarian of the Adventist faith, like Hobbie who was used to work on a Saturdays.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.020" offset="615810">We held in the Sherbert that the denial violated Sherbert's constitutional right to free exercise of her religion because of forced down to choose between following a precepts of her religion, and forfeiting benefits and the one hand and the bundling one of the precepts of her religion in order to accept work on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.379" offset="705254">Governmental imposition of such a choice puts the same kind of burden upon the exercise of religion as would a fine imposed against her for her Saturday worship.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.545" offset="749871">Justice Powell and Justice Stevens have filed opinion concurring in the judgment; the Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
