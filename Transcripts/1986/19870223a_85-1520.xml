            <label>Mr. Andrew J. Pincus</label>
            <text syncTime="65.191" offset="410932">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="68.910" offset="425770">In Harlow v. Fitzgerald, this Court held that government officials sued for constitutional violations are entitled to immunity as long as their conduct was objectively reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.600" offset="468610">The case presents an important question regarding the application of Harlow, a question that has particularly significant implications for actions against law enforcement officers seeking damages for alleged violations of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.276" offset="527334">The events at issue in this lawsuit relate to the investigation of a bank robbery that occurred in St. Paul, Minnesota, on November 11, 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.733" offset="565159">Petitioner Russell Anderson was a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, assigned to the Bureau's local field office.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.221" offset="595043">He investigated the robbery by obtaining information from the tellers and other witnesses, and concluded that the robbery had been committed by Vadaain Dixon.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.529" offset="636317">Agent Anderson was familiar with Dixon as a result of his investigations of previous bank robberies that Dixon had committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.515" offset="668186">He also knew that Dixon had escaped two days earlier from a halfway house in which he was confined prior to sentencing for some of those previous bank robberies.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.574" offset="708519">Because of what he viewed as Dixon's propensity for violence, Agent Anderson determined that Dixon should be apprehended as soon as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.346" offset="743523">Agent Anderson and several of the local St. Paul police officers went to look for Dixon at the homes of his mother and his grandmother.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.683" offset="776960">Dixon was not found at either of those places.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.320" offset="791484">Based upon information that Dixon's wife had been staying with respondents, who are his sister and brother-in-law, and that a car resembling respondent's car had been used in the bank robbery, the officers then went to respondents' home.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.746" offset="857208">Respondents did not consent to a search of their home, but the officers nonetheless entered and searched the home to look for Vadaain Dixon.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.352" offset="891585">The facts concerning the execution of that search are in dispute, but Vadaain Dixon was not found.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.256" offset="919170">Responients subsequently commenced this action for damages against Agent Anderson and the St. Paul police officers, alleging that the warrantless entry in their home violated the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.516" offset="968281">Agent Anderson moved for summary judgment, and the District Court granted his motion, holding that the entry into the home was lawful because it was justified by probable cause and exigent circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.423" offset="1019899">The Court of Appeals vacated the District Court's judgment but found that factual disputes precluded a determination on summary judgment as to the constitutionality of Agent Anderson's conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.881" offset="1069740">The Court of Appeals then turned to consider an issue that was not decided by the District Court, whether Agent Anderson was entitled to immunity under this Court's decision in Harlow v. Fitzgerald.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.272" offset="1111223">The Court held that Agent Anderson was not entitled to immunity, because the legal standard governing his conduct, the requirement of probable cause and exigent circumstances to execute the warrantless search, had been clearly established at the time of the challenged search.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.214" offset="1175066">And the Court of Appeals remanded the case for a trial concerning the merits of respondents' Fourth Amendment claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.137" offset="1206726">Now let me stress at the outset the limited question that is before the Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.875" offset="1229714">We do not seek review of the portion of the Court of Appeals' judgment regarding the merits of respondents' Fourth Amendment claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.045" offset="1258344">And we do not seek a determination by this Court--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="280.314" stopTime="283.933">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="280.314" offset="1271406">Mr. Pincus, would you repeat that last sentence again?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_j_pincus" startTime="283.933" stopTime="363.601">
            <label>Mr. Andrew J. Pincus</label>
            <text syncTime="283.933" offset="1285930">--Yes, sir, we do not seek a determination in this Court about whether or not the District Court properly granted summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.121" offset="1314664">We haven't sought... we do not raise that issue in our cert petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.906" offset="1329815">And so the merits of the substantive question, whether Agent Anderson actually violated the Fourth Amendment, are not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.231" offset="1375059">And we similarly do not seek a determination by the Court as to whether Agent Anderson is entitled to immunity on the facts of this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.570" offset="1408496">What we are seeking is review of the Court of Appeals' conclusion that Agent Anderson was not entitled to immunity simply because the legal standard was settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.128" offset="1454681">In our view, the Court of Appeals simply applied the wrong test in determining whether immunity was appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.198" offset="1478922">We think the question is not whether the legal standard is appropriate, but whether the particular officer... a reasonable officer in Agent Anderson's position should have known that the conduct was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.689" offset="1532943">The Court of Appeals did not even consider that question, and we think therefore improperly deprived Agent Anderson of his immunity defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.064" offset="1570455">Now the starting point in determining how Harlow should be applied in this context is the Court's decision in Harlow itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.151" offset="1602743">And what--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="363.601" stopTime="447.990">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="363.601" offset="1604623">Mr. Pincus, can I just interrupt you?</text>
            <text syncTime="365.720" offset="1613087">Do you think it's perfectly clear that the Court of Appeals said that he simply does not have an immunity defense, or he doesn't have one that can be decided on summary judgment?</text>
            <text syncTime="375.375" offset="1651644">Well, Justice Stevens, the way we read the Court of Appeals' opinion is that it simply disposed of the immunity issue altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.218" offset="1703053">And I guess in the passage of the opinion that's reprinted on pages 16A and 17A of the petition for certiorari states that Officer Anderson has cited no persuasive reason why he could not reasonably have been aware of this clearly established law.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.830" offset="1777450">And we think that's a determination that the immunity issue is just out of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.699" offset="1788943">Well, he hasn't done that at this stage of the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.834" offset="1805557">But I don't know that that would have foreclosed him from making a further record.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.471" offset="1820081">Because as you point out, the District Court decided the case on the constitutional issue, said there was no probable cause and no exigent circumstances as a matter of law, and it didn't even reach the immunity issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.879" offset="1869714">So I'm not clear whether the record had been fully developed on the question of whether he was entitled to immunity or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.266" offset="1891239">Your submission I take it is that even though the Court of Appeals may not have finally decided the immunity question, they applied the wrong standard in guiding the District Court as to how to decide.</text>

            <text syncTime="649.786" offset="2749309">And in order to decide when a right is clearly established, we think it's necessary to look to the reasons that the Court adopted this immunity test in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.609" offset="2788597">And Harlow makes clear that there are two considerations that are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.795" offset="2805316">On the one side is the interest in permitting recovery for constitutional violations; and on the other side is the need to protect government officials from liability so they will not be reluctant to vigorously perform their duties.</text>

            <text syncTime="708.757" offset="2985247">Well, we think that the question here is whether on the facts of this case it was clearly established that respondents had a right not to... for Officer Anderson not to conduct a warrantless search of their home.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.834" offset="3041463">So the right in this case doesn't turn just on the legal standard, it turns on how the legal standard interacted with the particular facts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.856" offset="3073646">But in any event, I think the Court... although that particular phrase may have been less than clear, the Court in other places in Harlow specifically made clear that the question was whether the officer reasonably could have known that what he was going to do violated the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.382" offset="3139683">In another portion of the opinion, for example, the Court said, where an official could be expected to know that certain conduct would violate statutory or constitutional rights, he should be made to hesitate.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.340" offset="3179494">And it made clear that in that context, that... that that's the context in which a government officer should be held liable, and only that context.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.713" offset="3213035">So Harlow, we think, makes it quite clear that the way the Court struck the balance between liability and immunity was to say that only where an officer reasonably could have known that what he was about to do was unconstitutional should he be held liable in damages for that action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1075.963" offset="4454060">And it's something that the Court has recognized in the Malley case, and also in Leon, where the Court, in both cases, the Court has recognized that although conduct can violate the Fourth Amendment, and thus be unreasonable in that sense, it may have been objectively reasonable for the officer to believe that that conduct was lawful, and therefore he would be entitled to immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1109.267" offset="4587285">The difference, I think, is that the... the objective reasonable test in Harlow is not a general reasonableness inquiry, it's an inquiry that takes as its guide the established case law, and sees what the officer could have thought based on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.193" offset="4646948">Whereas the Fourth Amendment reasonableness inquiry, under the probable cause standard, for example, is a more general type of inquiry, directed toward what a prudent person would have thought.</text>

            <text syncTime="1170.572" offset="4832418">It's hard to predict in advance exactly what might happen in the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.858" offset="4845583">If there's some error that we think this Court should review, we might well be back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.262" offset="4867213">But we think that at this stage what's important is to get right the legal standard that those courts have to apply in deciding immunity in this context, and then it will be necessary to see whether they in fact apply that standard correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.325" offset="4943490">Let me just turn for one moment to the rule advanced by respondents, because we think it makes clear why the Harlow standard has to be interpreted in the manner for which we contend... and in the manner that the Court applied it in the Malley case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.720" offset="5017051">The rule that respondents support and that the Court of Appeals applied is that the existence of a settled legal standard just automatically eliminates all immunity for actions taken where that standard applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.694" offset="5068983">And we think it's clear that that would work quite a breathtaking reduction in the immunity available to government officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.200" offset="5095001">For example, just taking law enforcement officers as a single example, settled Fourth Amendment standards govern a lot of routine law enforcement activities, such as searches, seizures, and investigatory stops.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.508" offset="5144215">And under the Court of Appeals rule, officers would never be entitled to immunity in connection with any of those activities, and thus an officer would have no leeway for miscalculation in the performance of those duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.649" offset="5192803">Everytime he misjudged the requirements of the Fourth Amendment, even if it was a very close question, he would be required to answer in damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.671" offset="5224881">And we think holding officers to that standard is counter to the Court's repeated affirmation that Harlow allows ample room for mistaken judgments, and assures immunity for all but the plainly incompetent or those that knowingly violate the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1292.787" offset="5321326">You don't have to be correct that there's criminal activity, or that it's the product of a crime; you just have to have probable cause to believe, which means a reasonable person would think it's there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1307.212" offset="5379004">Well, Your Honor, the problem with that argument is that the probable cause standard assumes that officers will be able to act up until the limit of where probable cause exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.485" offset="5420068">The reason that the standard is set low is because often at the initial stage of an investigation an officer can't have enough facts to know precisely what's going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.674" offset="5452878">And what society has decided is that where the officer has facts that amount to probable cause, even if they're just barely probable cause, his action is legally correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.649" offset="5496764">And if he was required to be absolutely right in that judgment or answer in damages, an officer would obviously not... would be quite reluctant to take action unless he was quite sure he was way over the boundary, because the alternative would be for him to be liable in damages for any misjudgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.575" offset="5564473">So we think the effect of that approach is necessarily going to be to make officers extremely reluctant to act unless they have something that is quite a lot more than probable cause, and to harm law enforcement activity as a result.</text>

            <text syncTime="1795.607" offset="7332650">I would like to address right up front here some of the questions you've been asking, and there's been a number of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.177" offset="7358877">But to come back to Justice Stevens' question concerning the probable cause requirement at common law, I think it is an interesting point to note that the Malley decision was based on a standard that was appropriate in malicious prosecution, where there would be an immunity without probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.591" offset="7448529">But in a trespass case, or false arrest case, you could never have an immunity without probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.910" offset="7473815">That's my understanding of the common law, and it's derived mainly from the Pierson case, where they said you needed probable cause and good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.116" offset="7506625">That leads me to a point that I'd like to make about the government's claim that our standard of immunity is somehow a breathtaking reduction in the immunity from what Harlow established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.991" offset="7554168">I don't think it is at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.924" offset="7561900">Because Harlow did two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.895" offset="7577783">Harlow eliminated a lawsuit in a case where there was a novel constitutional right being asserted, or a new development.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.751" offset="7621146">And it established an immunity right up front in the case, where you could get summary judgment just based on the state of law, a purely legal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.641" offset="7660748">And I think that's clearly what the Court held in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.343" offset="7675585">And it also did one other thing; It eliminated the malice prong of the standard, which allowed a defendant to get summary judgment more easily right on the merits, because there wouldn't be that factual question still existing that was always a fact-based question that precluded summary judgment when it came to malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.876" offset="7773701">So even accepting our standard, as we formulate it under Harlow, the government has still a broader defense because that malice has been eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.968" offset="7826050">And I don't think that the way we formulate the standard leads to such a drastic reduction as what--</text>

            <text syncTime="1993.016" offset="8122279">Because in doubtful cases, where the officer goes to get the warrant, the search should be upheld.</text>

            <text syncTime="2363.306" offset="9603422">First of all, that simply because an officer violate a right does not mean that somebody is going to receive a huge damage award, and that there are ways to deal with that in the damages area, or in just settling the suit up front if they think there was a violation, or if there's a holding there was a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.969" offset="9694014">You don't have to go through the rigors of litigation necessarily in all these suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.539" offset="9712300">Now the Justice Department, under the regulation I've cited in my brief, takes the position that we'll never settle a lawsuit unless there's a judgment, and that we'll defend to the last ditch attempt in all these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.133" offset="9770710">Now, I think that dealing with it at the damage end is one way to deal with your concern, and the other one is to reimburse the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.607" offset="9816581">If the executive thinks that one of their people made a good faith mistake in applying the standard, you can still preserve the right by being able to sue, like in trespass, for a nominal damage, or establish that you had the right, and they could reimburse the official.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.033" offset="9882305">They certainly provide them with good legal counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.985" offset="9898083">I learned that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.137" offset="9906756">But in any event, we believe that by adopting the petitioner's proposed standard, this Court would inevitably do away with the rule that searches of doubtful legality conducted without a warrant should fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.816" offset="9977391">I can't see any way that that rule could survive this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.736" offset="9997139">It certainly would be the case that innocent people would not be entitled to the benefit of that rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="2486.751" offset="10097136">Here, there was absolutely no deterrent from Russell Anderson proceeding against that rule when he was searching for a fugitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.393" offset="10139768">Because the fugitive would have no standing to suppress any evidence if he was in the home of a third party, and he couldn't suppress his body.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.248" offset="10179161">So in the context of the Steagald case, the only way you can give effect to the Steagald case is to make sure that innocent people have an adequate remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2619.522" offset="10628258">Because if you take Pierson v. Ray, which is a case that would be, I think, one of the cases most directly applicable in this context, the Court there didn't really hold that he had immunity; they just said that in a 1983 action a police officer would have a defense based on probable cause and good faith.</text>

Economou, there's a foot note in the case that says, the government was opposing the Bivens act, the Bivens case, because they were saying, well, the state law tort action gives you a good enough remedy, and that all the probable cause standard would do there is provide a defense to that action, so there should be a federal cause of action like we have here today.</text>

            <text syncTime="2906.858" offset="11777646">The Leon decision gave real meaning to that preference, because when you turn to use a warrant, you are able to use the evidence.</text>
