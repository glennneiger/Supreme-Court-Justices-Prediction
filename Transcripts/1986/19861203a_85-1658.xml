            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="71.987" offset="434512">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="77.563" offset="456873">The Pole Attachments Act of 1978, which the Court of Appeals held unconstitutional in this case, was enacted in response to a particular concern expressed in the Congressional committee reports and hearings, and in a staff report of the Federal Communications Commission that was submitted to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.489" offset="560527">That concern is properly understood against the familiar backdrop of State public utility regulation, under which electric and telephone companies are granted monopoly power through franchising, and are allowed to use public rights of way for their poles, or to acquire easements across private property for that purpose, sometimes by use of power of eminent domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.492" offset="692602">And in return for these monopoly privileges, State public utilities commissions regulate the rates that the utilities can charge their customers to assure that they are just and reasonable, and provide a fair rate of return.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.219" offset="763446">The particular concern that was the focus of Congressional attention was that a new class of customers of these utilities, cablecasters, who were renting excess space on the utility poles, were very frequently being omitted from the protection of rate regulation by the State public utilities commission while being subjected to the superior bargaining position of the utilities companies that resulted from their government-conferred monopoly power.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.829" offset="921957">And the committee reports on the bill, in describing the testimony before Congress, are replete with references to such phrases as "superior bargaining position", "exorbitant rental fees", "extract monopoly rents", "virtual contracts of adhesion"; and at one point pointing out that once the cablecaster has strung his wires on the pole, then he could be subjected to substantial increases in rates without explanation or an opportunity for negotiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.220" offset="1079423">So Congress' solution to this problem that had been brought to it was to give the Federal Communications Commission authority unless and until the State commissions asserted jurisdiction over these rates, authority to resolve disputes between the contracting parties for these rentals regarding the fairness of the fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.928" offset="1194258">The act applies only if the utility has voluntarily agreed to permit an attachment by cablecasters to its poles.</text>

            <text syncTime="636.810" offset="2693791">No, Your Honor, they have taken the position that if they are reducing the rate from the contract rate, they can only reduce it to the maximum allowable under the statute, which is the so-called fully allocated cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.036" offset="2758783">And that includes a component for the so-called cost of capital, and namely, a component for a fair rate of return on the investment, which they calculate by reference to what the State public utility commission uses.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="669.171" offset="2823254">It does.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.405" offset="2828165">Because the complaint is solely about the rates, and not being allowed to adhere to the contractual rates, rather than about the attachment itself, what we have here is an objection to the statute which, while it's in the form of a takings complaint, the objection is at bottom a complaint of loss of a business opportunity or of interference with contractual freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.657" offset="2957210">And of course entirely valid regulation of commerce characteristically restricts business or contractual opportunities that would otherwise exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.700" offset="3005379">Obvious illustrations would be the Fair Labor Standards Act; the securities laws; the food and drug laws; the oil price controls of a few years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.478" offset="3048534">This is the commonest element of regulation of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.446" offset="3064416">And to bring the examples closer to home here, under this Court's jurisprudence upholding public utility rate regulation, appellees would clearly be precluded from making any claim that the State has taken their property rights in their inventory of electric energy by restricting the price at which it may be sold to just and reasonable rates, even though a property owner's bundle of rights includes a right to alienate.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.275" offset="3211642">Now, in this case, the owner has chosen to alienate only a leasehold interest, rather than title to the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.380" offset="3252080">But that is no reason for a different result with respect to rate regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.580" offset="3272873">In the factual context we have, the statutory rate regulation is a form of rent control.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.076" offset="3318849">It regulates the rental rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.670" offset="3329298">And like other instances of rate regulation, rent control, if nonconfiscatory, is constitutionally permissible, and does not constitute a taking of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.321" offset="3379871">That is what this Court's opinion strongly indicated in Loretto v. Teleprompter, and that is what eight Justices squarely held in dismissing for want of a substantial Federal question a Constitutional challenge to the Cambridge, Massachusetts rent control ordinance in Fresh Pond Shopping Center against Callahan, even though the present Chief Justice in dissent correctly pointed cut that a takings question under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments was presented, and that the questions might be postponed or avoided, if I may quote, if the case were here on certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.975" offset="3562519">But the case is in an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.475" offset="3568475">We act on the merits, whatever we do, unquote.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.925" offset="3586343">So our primary submission, relying on the rent control jurisprudence of this Court, is that the Federal act does not effect a taking of appellees' property.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.218" offset="3639423">Our brief also... also shows that the statutory scheme, in any event, provides the appellees with just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.227" offset="3687489">They claim that the statutory formula falls short of awarding them market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.537" offset="3716746">But in the factual context we have here, their use of the term, market value, is a mere euphemism for monopoly profits to which there is no Constitutional entitlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.719" offset="3781425">And contrary to appellees' further contention, the reviewing court is fully able in these cases to hear Constitutional as well as statutory claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="1105.246" offset="4567606">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.821" offset="4585892">I'm appearing on behalf of the cable company and cable association parties that participated in the proceeding below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.397" offset="4616194">In regard to the questions that were propounded to Mr. Wallace, let me just add that only the State of California requires access to utility poles for purposes of cable television.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.391" offset="4668125">No other State has such a statute, although a number of States do regulate this activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.060" offset="4690800">And when they regulate this activity, under the Federal statute, there is an automatic preemption by the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.699" offset="4717340">There is no Federal requirement of access.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.244" offset="4735521">In this case, there was no local compulsion of access.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.977" offset="4750463">The utility voluntarily licensed... in fact, has licensed cable systems for over 20 years, to use excess space on its poles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.239" offset="4783587">I would to just make this observation, that the very purpose of the Pole Attachment Act was to prevent utilities such as Florida Power from charging a rate for the cable attachment that was based on the scarcity value or the hold-up value of the pole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.340" offset="4859969">As Mr. Wallace noted, Congress found that utilities controlled a critical gateway to the provision of an important interstate communication service; that the utilities were seeking to exact a monopoly profit for the use of the gateway; and that the regulation of the gateway was required in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.271" offset="4927678">The statute, we believe, is thus similar to the regulation of a grain elevator in Munn v. Illinois, or other efforts by government or States to regulate an essential... the use of an essential gateway in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.515" offset="4980654">The Eleventh Circuit, we believe, pushed the Loretto analogy far beyond the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.887" offset="5010121">In Loretto, as distinguished from this case, the New York statute mandated that the cable come on the premises of an unwilling property owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.696" offset="5057350">Here, the FCC... neither the FCC nor the statute vests in th cable company any right to have access to utility property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.613" offset="5109072">In its takings analysis in the Loretto case, this Court noted a number of characteristics of the ownership of property that, when disturbed by a government-regulated occupation, will... will rise to a taking of that property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.510" offset="5188589">The Court noted that the property is taken, or that a third party takes possession of the property, against the wishes of the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.602" offset="5217010">The Court noted that the owner cannot repossess the property that has been occupied; and that the owner cannot control the use of the possession of the property after it's been occupied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.161" offset="5255254">Here, for over 20 years, as I noted, Florida Power has voluntarily licensed its poles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.018" offset="5278659">The contract that it employs for that purpose is in the Joint Appendix, and that orders the relationship between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.874" offset="5302065">And the contract provides that at any time Florida Power wishes, it can deny space to a cable operator if it has a need for the space; it can repossess any space that it requires for its own needs; and it can continue to control the pole, irrespective of the occupation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.007" offset="5378656">The Eleventh Circuit engaged in a great deal of speculation about the permanency of the occupation, but it had only to look to the contract between the parties to see that the use was conditional upon the utility getting the pole back at any time that it needed it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1537.482" offset="6296494">Now, I would like to just mention that in the contract that Florida Power has employed for the relationship with cable systems, which is, as I said, in the Joint Appendix, it has precluded an entire class of poles that cannot be used by cable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.257" offset="6363577">And they are concrete poles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.772" offset="6369637">Florida Power, I assume because of the environment in the State of Florida, has elected to use some poles that are made out of concrete.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.988" offset="6402552">And I believe... because I'm not sure... but I believe because they do not have those poles weakened by having a hole drilled through them, for... historically, they have refused to allow cable systems to use them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.875" offset="6446124">And there has never been a case that I'm aware of, at least, in which a cable operator successfully has argued that I should have access to those poles because they're there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.856" offset="6481964">They made a rational decision to exclude cable, and the FCC and States have not interfered with that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.791" offset="6505787">Turning to the issue of compensation, we agree with Mr. Wallace that there's no taking here under the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.178" offset="6551345">But we also believe that even if you accept a taking under the Loretto model, this statute provides for just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.128" offset="6583110">Interestingly, Florida Power did not claim that this statute was unconstitutional before the Eleventh Circuit, but that the order of the FCC constituted a taking of its property without just compensation, because, Florida Power argued, the FCC set the compensation on the basis of fully allocated cost, rather than on the value to the cable system, which is what Florida Power wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.244" offset="6675583">The Eleventh Circuit, on a point that was not briefed by any party, held that the statute was facially unconstitutional because it prevented the FCC from determining just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.521" offset="6720723">But in Alabama Power v. FCC, in a case before the D.C. Circuit, the panel that included Justice... then Judge Scalia... the D.C. Circuit held that the FCC is not bound... is not bound to set compensation at any particular level by the Pole Attachment Act; but indeed, that the FCC is obligated to set the element of... the rate of return at whatever level would be required to avoid a confiscation of the utility's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.539" offset="6856769">We believe, Your Honor... Honors, that the statute is Constitutional.</text>

            <label>Mr. Allan J. Topol</label>
            <text syncTime="1687.143" offset="6895116">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.094" offset="6926986">At the outset, I'd like to be clear as to what it is that this case is about, and what the defect is that we see in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.293" offset="6959796">Congress prescribed a binding formula for the determination of the rates that utilities could charge cable companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.508" offset="6996576">And this is an important point, because Mr. Wallace indicated that the statute is mushy; that it could expand... the scheme was "malleable", his term... it could expand to provide just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.145" offset="7043179">With all due respect, I believe that's incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.768" offset="7057703">The statute, at pages... page 51A of the Government's appendix, indicates Congress set a formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.891" offset="7090199">It said, you may not require the payment of less than X dollars, X being incremental costs; but you may not permit the payment of more than Y dollars, Y being the term that's tossed around in the briefs as allocated costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.822" offset="7161879">And in our view, herein lies the defect in this statutory situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.818" offset="7185912">Congress, which has taken the property, Congress which has authorized the taking, is the same body which has fixed the compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.643" offset="7225200">It has done so by means of a formula: not less than X and not more than Y.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.359" offset="7252054">And in our system of jurisprudence, or the authorities I'm going to discuss, Congress can't both take the property and determine the compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.152" offset="7291237">The Congress can take the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.246" offset="7299596">It can get into the fray between utilities and CATV companies if it wants to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.604" offset="7321017">It can say, as between two monopolists, the cable people who have a monopoly in their area, and the utilities who have a monopoly for utility service, it can address the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.241" offset="7363544">But having decided to take, having decided to have utility customers subsidize, in essence, CATV customers by taking utility property, it can't then fix the rate of compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.673" offset="7413281">And that's our difficulty with this statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1835.215" offset="7487469">And as this Court said in the Monongahela Navigation case is, once the Congress takes, the court has to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.337" offset="7515890">Now the question is, how in each case is the court going to determine what's just compensation?</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.367" offset="7540027">The cases of this Court, for example, the 564 Acres case, says, the standard for just compensation is what will put the party in the same pecuniary situation as he would have been had there been no taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.705" offset="7593422">That's $6 for us in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.375" offset="7604080">The Olson case says, the standard of just compensation is fair market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.279" offset="7627694">It explicitly says in Olson, which we quote in our brief, that it's not enough to look at costs and to look at investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.042" offset="7654757">The inquiry as to just compensation has to be broader.</text>

            <text syncTime="1956.825" offset="7973869">And I think from the record evidence, given the fact that the FCC was operating with such a very, very narrow inquiry and a narrow record, in this statutory scheme, that is simply impossible for a reviewing court to make a determination on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.663" offset="8041265">And that's what bothered the Eleventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.522" offset="8052654">We didn't have an opportunity for a... had this statutory scheme said, very broadly, the FCC should make a determination of just compensation in a Constitutional sense, and that decision would be reviewed by an appellate court, then we would have no difficulty with that scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.263" offset="8135619">But our difficulty is the fact that the FCC isn't given the broad latitude to make a determination, and indeed, to make a record, even, with respect to just compensation in a Constitutional sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="2017.333" offset="8215972">I mean, I believe that what the Eleventh Circuit said the defect in this statute was, and they quoted specifically from the Monongahela Navigation case, if I may, to read just two sentences, because I think that's the essence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.718" offset="8277412">It's the key quote in the Eleventh Circuit and it's the essence of our argument, is the court... this Court, in the navigation case, said:</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.263" offset="8307610">It does not rest with the public taking the property through Congress or the legislature, its representative, to say what compensation shall be paid, or even what shall be the rule of compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.946" offset="8358392">The Constitution has declared that just compensation shall be paid, and the ascertainment of that is a judicial inquiry.</text>

            <text syncTime="2066.878" offset="8414085">And it shouldn't be $6 a pole; it should be $1.79.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.783" offset="8429758">On this issue of whether or not there was just compensation, there's only one court decision... court decision outside of the rubric of this statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2081.827" offset="8473853">It's the Continental Cable television, a 1983 Sixth Circuit opinion which is discussed on page 36 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.418" offset="8512305">It came up from the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.121" offset="8519097">It involved Section 2 charges, the charges that the utility were monopolizing, and there was also a counter-claim in quasi-contract or unjust enrichment for pole space that was occupied that wasn't subject to contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.816" offset="8581895">And in that case, the issue was... factual issue... what's a reasonable rate for a pole attachment?</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.484" offset="8616481">And a District Court... which incidentally, didn't... it could have followed the statute and come out with something like $1.79, but it didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.935" offset="8642290">The District Court decision in that case came up with a conclusion of $5.60 per pole was, quote, reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3111.548" offset="12592736">And we basically hold... the analysis is twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.875" offset="12606111">One, we argue that there is a taking in the Loretto sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.827" offset="12625859">When one looks at Loretto, it's CATV, it's hookups, it's screws, it's bolts, it's precisely the same kind of hardware.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.388" offset="12660132">The voluntary nature, given what the FCC has said in its regulations and in its cases, it's not voluntary as to Florida Power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.775" offset="12697644">So given the fact that the hookup's the same; given the fact that there's no voluntariness; the first part of our argument is that we have a taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.694" offset="12733379">And it seems to me it would distort, as the Eleventh Circuit found, the meaning of Loretto to say, we're going to carve out an exception here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.237" offset="12767547">And I would really--</text>

            <text syncTime="3180.227" offset="12867544">What I'm saying is, indeed, the Federal Government can even authorize the taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.429" offset="12884263">But once it does so, it has to provide for a judicial vehicle for determination of just compensation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3196.191" offset="12931387">That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.113" offset="12935045">And I guess my situation is... my feeling is that the Loretto situation involved, again, monopoly aspects in the same sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.422" offset="12976318">I mean, Loretto was the owner of that particular apartment building.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.515" offset="12992619">One had to go through that apartment building.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.014" offset="13002650">I have difficulty finding any distinction between this factual situation and Loretto.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.075" offset="13026891">And I'm persuaded that the distinction the Court made in Loretto between permanent physical occupations and other regulation for purposes of the taking argument, made very good sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.054" offset="13074852">So I would urge you to continue the Loretto analysis and find no distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.115" offset="13095019">Having made that conclusion, hopefully first, then I would say, if there's a taking, we really are up against Monongahela Navigation, and should the Congress really be permitted to determine in a taking case, it's going to be not less than X and not more than Y.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.277" offset="13183730">And under the jurisprudence of this Court, I have a lot of difficulty with that conclusion; any more than the Department of Highways should be able to take someone's property and say to that person, you will receive only your costs, or your costs plus any improvements to the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.647" offset="13253216">That's not our legal standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.723" offset="13261471">Our legal standard is, you have a judicial determination of just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.329" offset="13279861">And it seems to me what this Court could say to the Congress is, you didn't provide that mechanism in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.233" offset="13315492">You boxed in the determination of just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.670" offset="13329285">Rewrite it, and say in broad terms... leave the FCC in the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.168" offset="13347257">The FCC makes a recommendation first as to whether or not there's just compensation in a Fifth Amendment sense, hearing all the evidence in a full proceeding directed to that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.179" offset="13395322">If the statute were rewritten in this form, if the Court said to the Congress, it has to be rewritten in that form to survive the Constitutional challenge, then Congress could do it and we could deal with the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.206" offset="13451433">But there's a terribly, terribly important principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.829" offset="13461882">And it's the question... back to Monongahela Navigation... should we let the Congress, which is doing the taking, if we find there's a taking, should we let the body, the Congress, that's doing the taking, be the one to make the determination as to just compensation?</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.261" offset="13531681">And we really feel, it shouldn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.947" offset="13542339">So I guess at bottom line we've got, our two basic issues are, one, we feel that under this Court's decision in Loretto... and we talk about the utility cases on poles and pole space... we believe under Loretta there is a taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.862" offset="13606078">And to create an artificial distinction--</text>
