            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="133809">We will hear argument first this afternoon in No. 85-5221, Griffith against Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.018" offset="173829">Mr. Aprile, we will hear from you first.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_vincent_aprile_ii" startTime="12.559" stopTime="127.184">
            <label>Mr. J. Vincent Aprile, II</label>
            <text syncTime="12.559" offset="183964">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.534" offset="203922">The case of Griffith versus Kentucky presents a single issue, and that is in cases pending on direct appeal should the holding in Batson versus Kentucky be given retroactive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.341" offset="251151">As a result of this Court's holding in Allen versus Hardy, there is no question before this Court that Batson will not be given retroactive effect in cases that were final when Batson was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.340" offset="307158">You have ruled Batson will not apply retroactively to those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.531" offset="323876">So it is in this context that Griffith versus Kentucky and the following case, Brown versus United States, present you the opportunity to take one step further than you did in Shea versus Louisiana and embrace the rule that you had prior to Linkletter versus Walker, and that is that you would return to decision that holds that all constitutional rules that are announced will be applied retroactively to all cases on direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.933" offset="449473">You have had 21 years of experimentation since Linkletter versus Walker and, as many of you have expressed in various opinions and past members of the Court have indicated, the difficulty with retroactivity that has been generated by the attempt to draw bright lines, particularly in the area of the question of direct review.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.908" offset="541424">We would submit that the easiest solution and perhaps one that would accommodate factors you have utilized in other contexts would be to go back to the pre-Linkletter versus Walker situation and, even though not constitutionally mandated, embrace the concept that those cases that have raised the same issue that are not final would be entitled to the benefit of the new constitutional principle announced.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="127.184" stopTime="144.547">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="127.184" offset="642465">Well, Mr. Aprile, does your submission embrace what is referred to as Justice Harlan's view on the subject, where I believe he said that all cases on direct review not final should get the benefit of the new rule, but none on habeas corpus should get the benefit?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_vincent_aprile_ii" startTime="144.546" stopTime="299.797">
            <label>Mr. J. Vincent Aprile, II</label>
            <text syncTime="144.546" offset="711951">Well, Your Honor, it is obvious from the context of the situation we are put in by the ruling in Allen versus Hardy that takes away the question of collateral relief in the Batson case, I am obviously not in a position to strongly advocate, as someone who has a client who's involved in that situation, for the adoption of the second part of Justice Harlan's approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.430" offset="799513">But I do feel that you have ideally set the situation and the table here to embrace it in the context of Batson.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.924" offset="825427">I think it's very interesting that if we look at what you decided in Shea versus Louisiana, in the footnote you pointed out that cases such as Brown versus the United States and Griffith versus Kentucky were not even decided on the basis of Shea versus Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.655" offset="888330">But those cases that were pending in this Court on writ of certiorari when Edwards versus United States came down were granted automatic remands.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.782" offset="940888">They were given retroactive application.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.823" offset="949038">And in your most recent case, Shea versus Louisiana, you only addressed the question of those that were really on direct review in state and federal courts and not pending before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.851" offset="989162">It's very difficult to say that there has been a good strong rationale for applying the different doctrines of retroactivity in cases on direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.788" offset="1044960">If I could perhaps subvert for a second, the two concepts that you've often used in the context of retroactivity, reliance and effect on the administration of criminal justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.048" offset="1093966">I submit to you that as you decide a case and announce a new constitutional rule and allow the question of retroactivity on direct appeal to swing and sway in the breeze, the lower courts then go on and make their decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.871" offset="1169198">Some will opt that the decision will be retroactive, some will opt that it will not be retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.234" offset="1190723">That generates much litigation by people on both sides of this podium, because if we lose we're going to come to you on petition for cert and ask that you hold that the case be retroactively applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.261" offset="1238789">If it goes the other way, they will come and ask the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.524" offset="1251850">So as far as impact on the administration of criminal justice and reliance by the courts below, it would seem that a rule that went back to pre-Linkletter and said there will be a presumption that when the case is on direct review, it is not final, it will get the benefit of the constitutional ruling.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="299.797" stopTime="310.162">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="299.797" offset="1332934">Well, what do you conceive the pre-Linkletter law, as you refer to it, to be with respect to cases that had become final and were on habeas corpus review or some sort of collateral attack?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_vincent_aprile_ii" startTime="310.162" stopTime="333.859">
            <label>Mr. J. Vincent Aprile, II</label>
            <text syncTime="310.162" offset="1374416">Well, I may be wrong in this, but it was my basic understanding that in that regard, in that mode, that they oftentimes were granted complete retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.399" offset="1411301">I have no quibble with the need in instances in dealing with full and complete retroactivity focusing on final decisions that perhaps it would be good for you to utilize tests such as the reliance and impact.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="333.859" stopTime="349.849">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="333.859" offset="1469189">Well, but you know, if you're talking about the desirability of a rule that everyone will know it's in effect the minute a decision comes down, isn't there also a good claim for a bright line rule in the collateral attack that it does not get retroactivity?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_vincent_aprile_ii" startTime="349.849" stopTime="377.637">
            <label>Mr. J. Vincent Aprile, II</label>
            <text syncTime="349.849" offset="1533136">Again, Your Honor, obviously there are arguments that could be made for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.053" offset="1549959">I think that some of the exceptions that you have carved out on both sides of the scale would have application there.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.418" offset="1575455">For example, when a case... when a decision announced by this Court significantly impacts on the truth-finding process, it may very well be that that is the type of exception that you will provide full retroactive relief on collateral situations.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="377.637" stopTime="393.259">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="377.637" offset="1644313">If you're getting into kind of the weighing of factors and so forth, certainly the reliance element militates against you here, it seems to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.963" offset="1677646">Obviously, there were people who did rely on the validity of the Swain decision at the time cases were tried, even though they hadn't become final.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_vincent_aprile_ii" startTime="393.259" stopTime="603.715">
            <label>Mr. J. Vincent Aprile, II</label>
            <text syncTime="393.259" offset="1706798">Well, I think that we can look at that in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.770" offset="1716829">I think that the particular case that you have before you today is different from many of the cases that you have decided retroactivity on.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.215" offset="1742638">Number one, the relief that you gave in Batson was not to reverse and grant a new trial, but it was remanded for a simple inquiry, an inquiry that involves, first of all, determining whether or not, usually from official court records, blacks were struck by the prosecutor in a large number; secondly, if that were true, the defendant showing he was a member of a cognizable racial groups; and then putting the prosecutor to the test of stating trial-related reasons why he made those strikes as opposed to racially biased reasons; and the court then deciding whether or not the prosecutor had overcome a prima facie showing of discrimination made, as you pointed out, could be now made under Batson.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.545" offset="1927899">What reliance was there in the past?</text>
            <text syncTime="451.637" offset="1940333">The reliance not to hold a hearing is all that we had.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.637" offset="1948274">As members of this Court pointed out in the Batson decision, certainly no prosecutor should have believed that he had the right to rely on Swain for the proposition that he could challenge people, blacks and other minorities, on the basis of race with no trial-related basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.869" offset="2021208">The only thing he had a right to rely on was that the courts probably were not going to utilize the evolving equal protection test in other contexts to require that the prosecutor respond to an allegation of racial prejudice in the context of one limited case.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.141" offset="2090276">Any prosecutor who had read even Swain would have thought to know that when this challenge was raised against him, the possibility that later he would be called on the carpet for his conduct in many cases and would have kept some sort of trial notebook, some sort of file, that would have allowed him to respond in these situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.811" offset="2161016">As this Court stated in Solem versus Stumes, unjustified reliance is no reliance at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.536" offset="2183899">Now, if there is a price to be paid by conducting hearings after the fact on this limited issue, it is certainly a price that we should pay for guaranteeing the right of participation of blacks in our jury system and secondly the right of a defendant not to have excluded from his particular jury people of his same race simply because the prosecution has a racially biased motive for excluding them.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.365" offset="2295180">So I think when we look at reliance, it's certainly... if you want to go back to the other standards and tests that this Court has utilized in dealing with retroactivity, this client, this Petitioner, Mr. Griffith, is not afraid to be judged under those standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.005" offset="2361740">As we pointed out in the brief, we think we succeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.946" offset="2373548">We do not think that this case is a clear break that mandates retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.151" offset="2398312">You have said in the context of Allen versus Hardy that it is an explicit and substantial break.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.646" offset="2424330">But indeed, in Allen versus Hardy you did not stop there.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.058" offset="2438018">This Court did not say this is an explicit... this is not a clearcut break.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.409" offset="2455363">You did not use the magic language, so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.183" offset="2466439">I find that not to be a conclusion of law finding by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.085" offset="2482113">But secondly, you went on and went through the reliance and the effect on the administration of justice analysis for collateral review.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.932" offset="2513460">I think by the very nature of the steps taken by this Court, it was clear that the majority opinion did not embrace the concept that this was a clear break in the law.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="603.715" offset="2548568">Well, that's only because we use a different test for collateral review.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.047" offset="2561943">I mean, we went through those additional steps because those are the additional steps we use for collateral review.</text>

            <text syncTime="636.867" offset="2681270">There are a number of cases in the last 21 years where this Court--</text>

            <text syncTime="641.141" offset="2698302">Going back 21 years, you can find a lot of different approaches, I'm sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.453" offset="2711572">I'm talking about the approach that we were following at the time of Allen.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.976" offset="2729649">We have followed one set of tests for collateral review and a different set for direct review.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Vincent Aprile, II</label>
            <text syncTime="654.819" offset="2753055">--Well, I would beg to differ with you in this regard, that if you look at a number of the retroactivity cases over that period of time there has often been the statement made that this Court sees no distinction in this case between full and complete retroactivity or limited retroactivity to those cases on direct review.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.575" offset="2848036">I would hope, and I would like to agree with you, that if the decision in Solem versus Stumes and Shea versus Louisiana create two different standards and embraces Johnson from the Fourth Amendment and says, from now on on direct review this is what we do, if Shea versus Louisiana is the controlling precept, then I have no trouble accepting that and saying, fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.138" offset="2938315">Then we will put aside that finding in Allen versus Hardy, as you wish to do, and say that you didn't have to reach that question because you used a different test of retroactivity on collateral review.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.255" offset="2978753">I'm willing to accept that, because I think if we use Shea versus Louisiana's test we are in much the same situation as Petitioner Shea was in, because again, while there was a change of rules, there was no clearcut break in precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.627" offset="3040297">And in that situation, what you did in Shea versus Louisiana was to look at the Harlan approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.340" offset="3063076">And when you looked at the Harlan approach, what did you say?</text>
            <text syncTime="735.503" offset="3075719">You said, if we utilize application of retroactivity of the Edwards decision to cases on direct review, we will provide fairness to each litigant that was before the Court on direct review, because each of them will be judged on the merits of their own case, not on the chance that their case was not the one selected to be the one in which you announced the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.280" offset="3182926">It's ironic that I stand before you today asking for equal treatment for Griffith in this case, when his substantive complaint is that he was denied equal protection by the action of the prosecutor in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.349" offset="3239141">I think it's ironic that I stand before you today and ask that you give him retroactive relief on direct review because of the chances that were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.135" offset="3278325">The same prosecutor that utilized his peremptory strikes in the way that he did in Batson versus Kentucky is the same prosecutor in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.401" offset="3319389">It occurred in the same circuit court.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.404" offset="3331406">The only difference is the division and some difference in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.896" offset="3345303">As this Court has frequently pointed out, litigants such as Mr. Griffith usually have no control over the speed at which their case reaches this Court, and it was only chance--</text>

            <text syncTime="1179.695" offset="4852568">I think it's very important that I point out to you that in looking at Allen versus Hardy I was concerned about the question of whether the impact of the process that's involved here, the new constitutional rule on the truth-finding process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.364" offset="4919233">I think that my case and Mr. Brown's case, the whole Batson concept, is more akin to the decision on retroactivity in Brown versus Louisiana applying Burch Louisiana, and I think it for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.546" offset="4983912">If we look at what happened in Burch versus Louisiana, this Court said that a six man jury had to be unanimous, and when it was a vote of five to one that that was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.805" offset="5044934">And that you said when you addressed that question in retroactivity language in Brown versus Louisiana was how this impeded and impaired the truth-finding function of a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.356" offset="5103135">And although it may not be immediately apparent, I think that what we have in Batson is a very similar situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.250" offset="5126749">If you realize under the facts of the situation, each of the jurors who were struck by the prosecutor, those jurors who were black, under the rules of procedure in Kentucky had survived every test that could be put to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.719" offset="5188607">There was only one way that they would not serve on the jury, and that is if random selection eliminated them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.514" offset="5215775">In many ways, they were like the sixth juror in Burch versus Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.045" offset="5233956">They were going to be on that jury but for one of two things: the prosecutor's improper peremptory challenge or random selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.141" offset="5270318">So in fact, they were pulled away at the very last minute from being able to participate in that jury, in much the same way the Louisiana rule nullified the one vote by not having a non-unanimous verdict when you had a six-man jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="1329.722" offset="5452653">And whether or not there would be any requirement then of random selection or they would have just come up with the number to try the case, 12, 13, 14, depending on the number of alternates, the point is still the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.431" offset="5503435">I used Kentucky because that's the facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.073" offset="5514093">The only way those people were stopped from sitting on the jury if there was no random selection was by the action of the prosecutor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1378.573" offset="5648049">It didn't know which juror would be come the one vote who didn't get counted, who didn't have to be there for a unanimous verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.499" offset="5675739">But here we have, at least on a prima facie showing we will have, that the action that deprived that juror of participating was done by a racially motivated action by a state employee, a prosecutor, when he knew under the statement made by this Court in Swain versus Alabama that it would be improper to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.853" offset="5769153">I say on that basis we make a very strong showing that what occurred in Batson versus Kentucky, the rule that you announced there, does have incredible impact on the truth-finding function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.243" offset="5818681">And on that basis alone, we should be entitled to retroactive application of Batson to cases on direct review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.578" offset="5848042">If we were to go to the Stovall criteria, the Linkletter versus Walker criteria, I believe that we can meet that, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.935" offset="5893496">I believe we can meet that for showing this:</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.317" offset="5906975">Number one, you have effectively removed a large number of cases that could cause impact on the judicial administrations of the state and federal courts by holding in Allen versus Hardy that this will not, Batson will not have collateral retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.010" offset="5981789">Now we are only dealing with the cases that are on direct review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.813" offset="5997045">It stands to reason that the relief that you granted in Batson will require some going back, some jogging of old memories and looking at court records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.341" offset="6043125">But we have put not a clear-cut, finite time line on this, but we know that most of the cases that will be on direct review will be those within a reasonable amount of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.319" offset="6090981">So consequently, it doesn't appear that there will be a large number of cases, nothing like there would have been had you granted full retroactive application of Batson, particularly to those cases on collateral review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.286" offset="6138942">And secondly, with regard to reliance, I think I've addressed that already by discussing, prosecutors and judges really didn't have a right to rely on Swain if it was to say prosecutors had the right to hide behind Swain in makin peremptory challenges based solely on race and not on trial-related conditions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1539.852" offset="6293169">In the 21 years and four months since Linkletter that Mr. Aprile referred to, there have been in our opinion or in our view two bodies or two schools of law that you have handed down with regard to the question, the very narrow question, of the retroactive application to cases on direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.403" offset="6367357">And we feel under either school of law or either body of thought the rule that you have handed down, the new rule of constitutional criminal procedure of April the 30th of this year in Batson versus Kentucky, requires prospective application only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.944" offset="6429528">In the first instance, Batson was a clear break case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.648" offset="6448336">It was a classic clear break case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.707" offset="6460562">Obviously, on this point Petitioner and Respondent disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.620" offset="6476235">The 1982 case of United States versus Johnson set out the standard test for clear break cases, and in effect you said that if there was a clear break case prospectivity is preordained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.088" offset="6522106">Batson meets two of the three criteria: It explicitly overruled a past precedent; that being Swain versus Alabama; and it disapproved a practice which this Court arguably has sanctioned in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.117" offset="6570276">Batson, we make this claim that it was a clear break because not only are there some similarities between Swain and Batson if you put them side by side, especially with regard to the dictates of this Court in the area of equal protection, but more importantly where we come with the clear break argument is that you effectively changed the nature of peremptory challenges, especially the use and purpose to which prosecutors or any litigant could avail himself in this particular case to the use of peremptory challenges in a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.012" offset="6717816">This Court specifically stated that, to the extent that Swain is inconsistent, it is overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.497" offset="6743729">Thus, we feel the argument can be made that Batson was precisely the type of clear break--</text>

            <text syncTime="1666.725" offset="6800676">But again, when you look at the language in Swain, Justice White went into great detail about the history and the system of peremptory challenges, that they would not be... that the use of a peremptory challenge to strike a black individual in a particular case is not a denial of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.900" offset="6885313">Batson, 20 years later, said it was, and that all of a sudden the unfettered, unchallenged right of a prosecutor to use a peremptory challenge, as handed down and as dictated by Swain, completely changed 180 degrees on April the 30th of this year, when now hearings have been indicated, reasons have to be propounded in order to justify such a use of a peremptory challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.737" offset="6992728">So we believe that classically this was a clear break case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.241" offset="7010700">Thirdly, as Mr. Aprile referred to, under Allen versus Hardy, two months to the day after Batson, this Court said Batson was an explicit and substantial break with prior precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.980" offset="7065662">Now, obviously you did not use the words or the magic words it was a clear break.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.963" offset="7081649">But I would submit that it's a very fine line between a clear break and an explicit and substantial break.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.808" offset="7104950">Again, the third point being that Batson was a clear break and deserves prospective application only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.522" offset="7139850">As one attempts to study this body of law, an issue or an element that consistently comes up is the question of whether or not it was foreshadowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.739" offset="7176735">Was Batson, was the demise of Swain foreshadowed?</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.101" offset="7194185">It's interesting, I think, to point out that not even Batson himself attacked Swain as the basis for overturning his particular conviction or the error that he raised in his particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.870" offset="7245280">No case on the basis of federal law claimed that Swain no longer controlled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.213" offset="7266596">In the states... there are two states you asked about the effect, I believe, Justice Blackmunn, that this might have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.996" offset="7289793">There are 48 states similarly situated who rest on your decision on the retroactivity question of Griffith and Batson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.922" offset="7325424">The two states that went their own way, if you will, cited the continued vitality of Swain and the continued application, and grounded their new approach on reasons particular to their own particular state constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1842.752" offset="7504728">The point being that Swain wasn't foreshadowed, and everybody up until April the 30th of this year, every state and every federal, every trial and every appellate court in this country, recognized Swain to be the law and the tenets of Swain to be the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.493" offset="7567736">So again, the argument that I'm trying to proffer to the Court is that when Batson came out it was a clear break and a dramatic clear break.</text>

            <text syncTime="2102.981" offset="8545656">All the earlier cases talk about the governmental action in discrimination with regard to the venire, with regard to jury service, with regard to actual participation on petit juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.930" offset="8589437">And now finally again, why Batson was such a clean break is you address the right of a litigant, the right of the Government, to use that peremptory challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.866" offset="8629247">And in effect what we hear you say is: Trial courts, prosecutors, we're going to change the rules, we're going to change the rules with regard to the use of peremptory challenges, and in the future go out and, if you will, sin no more; go out and follow our dictates in the future, just like you told the police officers in the sixties and in the seventies when a new embodiment of search and seizure law was handed down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.866" offset="8749202">It didn't affect... it wasn't retroactive to everybody else that was waiting in the wings, but you said, in the future go out and make this correction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.121" offset="8778250">We feel that was the purpose of the Swain... or the Batson decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.972" offset="8793610">The truth-finding, again citing this Court in Allen versus Hardy, in June of this year you said there may be, or that Batson may have some impact on truth-finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.143" offset="8854318">But you went on to say, as we believe and as we heard you, that this wasn't the sole purpose, and you talked about to ensure that the Government does not discriminate against citizens who are called for jury service and to strengthen public confidence in our administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.772" offset="8912833">So the rule in Batson we submit serves multiple ends, and only the first of which may have some impact on truth-finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.008" offset="8941776">Your cases, your decisions, have held that the impairment to truth-finding must be substantial and not merely incidental in order to be considered for retroactive application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.876" offset="8989215">The other tests under the traditional rules of reliance and effect I think that we have attempted to cover, that the reliance was universally viewed and upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.954" offset="9037593">It's been great by every court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.326" offset="9051073">And again, the thing to keep in mind, we would submit, is when you address us on this particular point you're not just talking to prosecutors; you're talking to trial and appellate courts, too, who took you at your word in Swain and what you held, and the reluctance that any of those courts had to overturn you until April the 30th.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.049" offset="9129962">The effect, we think, would be significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.141" offset="9150338">It's impossible, very difficult to know how many cases are involved out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.443" offset="9171549">I agree with Mr. Aprile that the reduction... or your language in Allen versus Hardy with regard to the collateral matters, that effectively removed many from consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.733" offset="9216689">But we still feel that the numbers are significant, and the difficulties and the burden on the courts that would be called into play should you hold Batson retroactive we would submit to you calls for prospective relief only.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.431" offset="9279487">So again, under either embodiment of law and principle as we interpret your decisions of the past 21 years, under the clear break test or under the traditional test, either application we feel calls for the prospective relief only of Batson versus Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.222" offset="9342599">I'd be happy to attempt to answer any questions should the Court have any.</text>

          <turn speaker="j_vincent_aprile_ii" startTime="2310.668" stopTime="2557.810">
            <label>Mr. J. Vincent Aprile, II</label>
            <text syncTime="2310.668" offset="9376454">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.459" offset="9379589">I would like to begin by addressing the statement that was made by the attorney general, that being that only two states have dealt with this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.835" offset="9417100">In pages 34 and 35 of the brief for the Petitioner, we point out a large number of states that have dealt with this particular question under their state constitutions or federal courts which have dealt with it under their supervisory power or, like the Sixth Circuit and the Second Circuit, dealing with it under a Sixth Amendment analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.167" offset="9502469">All of those particular analyses would reduce the number of cases that direct... retroactivity on direct review would approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.636" offset="9544265">For example, the attorney general tells us that only, I believe it was, California and Massachusetts had addressed this under their state constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.382" offset="9583239">New Jersey and Florida have both addressed it and, for example, Florida held under their state constitution this type of situation to require retroactive relief to all cases on direct review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.479" offset="9635693">But I won't burden you any longer with that, only to state that it substantially reduces the number of cases that would be affected by a grant of direct review retroactivity, because a lot of these cases have been decided in the state courts on different grounds and accomplished the same purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.251" offset="9706746">So they would not... this would not be a problem for many of those states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.644" offset="9720330">It seems to me as the proponent that if there will be a large impact on the administration of justice it is the obligation of the attorney general representing Kentucky to come forward and demonstrate to you this large number of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.994" offset="9781770">I believe it was in Shea versus Louisiana you looked at it and said that there has not been any showing by anyone that there would be this severe impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.840" offset="9817087">I would also point out that the reliance that has been placed on this particular decision should always be construed in the light that a prosecutor knew that at any time some litigant could come forward and attempt to raise the question of the office's or that particular prosecutor's repeated use under Swain versus Alabama of peremptory challenges in case after case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.117" offset="9930250">It would seem to me that the prosecutors' like criminal defense attorneys, had an obligation also to keep aware of the changes in the law with regard to equal protection violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.526" offset="9979882">This Court in Batson emphasized that the standards of proof continued to change from Swain up until Batson in the context of other equal protection violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.442" offset="10023559">What the representatives of the state of Kentucky say to you today is: We did not have any obligation to see the changes that were occurring with regard to equal protection violations in any other context; we had the right to rely solely upon what was said in Swain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.714" offset="10088656">And yet, they did not wish to rely on the broad teaching, the actual bright rule of Swain that was never changed, and that is that prosecutors could not use peremptory challenges in a way that would use race as a basis for disqualifying blacks from participating in juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.595" offset="10156157">So I don't believe that they have a good faith argument with regard to reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.838" offset="10173084">I believe we have demonstrated the need for a clear bright line test on direct appeal for retroactive application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.845" offset="10205162">I believe that the experience of this Court up until 1965 demonstrates that that can be accomplished without significant harm to the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.970" offset="10245600">And I think that in the right case, were you to find that you needed not to give retroactive application on direct review, it may be the case in which you would give solely prospective application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.230" offset="10298681">And I would suggest that, even if we go to the Shea versus Louisiana test or the Stovall v. Denno test, that we have demonstrated that Mr. Griffith is entitled, because his case was on direct review, to have retroactive application of Batson.</text>
