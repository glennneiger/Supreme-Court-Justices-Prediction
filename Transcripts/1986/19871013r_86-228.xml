            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="152814">The oral argument first this morning in No. 86-228, Kungys against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.272" offset="189803">Mr. Williamson, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="donald_j_williamson" startTime="11.739" stopTime="289.352">
            <label>Mr. Donald J. Williamson</label>
            <text syncTime="11.739" offset="199730">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.843" offset="212164">This is the reargument of a denaturalization case involving whether a final judgment of a federal court granting naturalized citizen to an immigrant can be vacated on the grounds he misrepresented in his immigration papers that he was two years old, and that he was born in a city instead of a town.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.279" offset="329924">At the time the Petitioner was granted his citizenship in 1954, Section 340 A of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which is 8 USC 1451(a), provided, in pertinent part, shall be the duty of the United States attorneys to institute proceedings for the purposes of revoking and setting aside the order admitting such person to citizenship, and cancelling a Certificate of Naturalization on the ground that such order and Certificate of Naturalization were procured by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.593" offset="519155">The District Court expressly found that the Petitioner, had he given the correct information on his visa application form, his visa nevertheless would have been issued, and that there is nothing to suggest that his having been born on September 21, 1915, in Reistru, would have had any effect whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.743" offset="627720">The Court of Appeals agreed with that finding, and, indeed, it did not declare that any of the findings of the District Court were clearly erroneous as was required by Rule 52(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="134.687" offset="691459">Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the District Court and by construing the alternative approach to materiality in Chaunt, as permitting proof that disclosure of Petitioner's true date and town of birth would have resulted in an investigation notwithstanding the fact that the District Court expressly found that the government's own proofs indicated that no investigation would have resulted.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.724" offset="815697">Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals, in effect, drew an inference in favor of the government that the disclosure of the truth of his correct date and place of birth would have led to residency records in Germany, and from those residency records you could draw a further inference that he was not a victim of Nazi persecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.273" offset="917888">A former vice counsel, but one who had not processed the Petitioner's papers, had testified that that was an ultimate disqualifying fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.147" offset="961356">In other words, if you are not a victim of Nazi persecution, you are not eligible for a nonpreference "immigration visa".</text>
            <text syncTime="210.670" offset="995420">However, as indicated by the statement at oral argument by the government, there was no such statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.324" offset="1022065">There was no such regulation, and therefore there is no ultimate fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.109" offset="1041186">So the posture of the case at this point is that the government has no proof of any ultimate disqualifying fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.499" offset="1078803">And their argument, therefore, is that Chaunt does not require proof of an ultimate disqualifying fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.736" offset="1107746">And their further argument is that any misrepresentation, irrespective of materiality, is sufficient to have constituted a legal procurement, because the words 1451 by an amendment in 1965, which was seven years after Mr. Kungys or the Petitioner was granted his citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.886" offset="1216311">The short argument to the fact that a nonmaterial misrepresentation cannot be the basis for denaturalization is that the statute, Section 1451, explicitly requires that the misrepresentation or concealment be as to a material fact.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="289.352" stopTime="307.897">
            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="289.352" offset="1310143">Well, Mr. Williamson, you say in effect then that the part of 1451 that talks about misrepresentation covers the waterfront so far as denaturalization is concerned, and that you can't bring other forms of misrepresentation in under the head of illegally procured?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="donald_j_williamson" startTime="307.897" stopTime="485.262">
            <label>Mr. Donald J. Williamson</label>
            <text syncTime="307.897" offset="1384331">Yes, what I argue, and in fact what I think is reasonable clear is that when Congress sets forth that the basis for denaturalization when it comes explicitly to a misrepresentation must, in effect, be procured by a concealment of a material fact, that is clear language; clear in the sense that it certainly the requirement of materiality is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.964" offset="1496657">To argue, in effect, because there are nonmisrepresentational forms of conduct that can in effect constitute illegal procurement irrespective of whether there is a misrepresentation, i.e., such as if a person has contracted a dangerously contagious disease and is unaware of, they could still be denaturalized; i.e., if a person engaged in rape and if there was no such question asking whether you, in effect, had engaged in rape; or whether or not you had aided the illegal entry of other aliens, those are the examples which were used in the legislative history in 1961 to indicate the reason for the change.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.041" offset="1664886">But that doesn't mean in point of fact that when you attempt to use illegal procurement as the arguments made by the government in the case of Fedorenko, and there is an interesting statement in the brief on page 18 of solicitor general, whether Petitioner's citizenship is considered to be illegally procured, or procured by misrepresentation, the primary basis for its revocation, Petitioner's false representations concerning his whereabouts during World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.647" offset="1799364">Accordingly, we agree that Petitioner's wartime activities, specifically his guard duty at Triblinka must be shown to be material facts within the meaning of 8 USC 1451(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="427.224" offset="1861640">That was the case... the government argued that in Fedorenko in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.259" offset="1873761">This is the brief of the United States in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.561" offset="1887031">And, indeed, that particular portion of the brief, I believe, was the basis when Justice Marshall speaking for the majority in Fedorenko indicated that notwithstanding the fact that the petitioner there had misrepresented his country of birth on his visa, but that did not end the judicial inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.445" offset="1986505">Justice Marshall speaking for the majority court said,</text>
            <text syncTime="461.311" offset="1997999">"We agree with the government that that does not end the judicial inquiry, because the test is still materiality. "</text>
            <text syncTime="467.467" offset="2022659">Indeed, the question there was still materiality as to whether or not the status of being a concentration camp guard, in effect, was a predicate for denaturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.858" offset="2076158">And, indeed, that particular case was an illegal procurement case.</text>

            <text syncTime="886.807" offset="3700034">And it states that it must be procured by the misrepresentation of a material fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.295" offset="3725947">When it comes to illegal procurement, as Justice Brennan indicated in the Costello case, the reason for the inclusion of the language of misrepresentation of material fact was to distinguish between intrinsic fraud and extrinsic fraud, but clearly it was not the situation given a lucid definition of misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.076" offset="3821033">There is nothing in the legislative history to suggest that.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.026" offset="3828870">There is nothing in the legislative history to suggest the incorporation of 1101, or 1101(f)(6).</text>
            <text syncTime="927.968" offset="3864605">So that I would suggest that the distinction goes beyond the mere burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.872" offset="3892295">But in any event, getting back to Justice O'Connor's question if I may, I think that it's more than simply the mere dictionary meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.631" offset="3947256">When we look at Black's Law Dictionary, Black's Law Dictionary addresses I think a more pertinent aspect of it, because it goes to the question of material fact in the context of the law, in the context of a contract, and the contracts of insurance policies, in the context of a pleading, in a context, for example, of a Motion for Summary Judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.926" offset="4028445">In those particular instances the cause and effect relationship of materiality, it's without which the particular contract wouldn't have been granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.816" offset="4068047">The insurance policy wouldn't have issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.102" offset="4077137">So in this particular instance, it has to be more than simply important.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.970" offset="4096677">It is a but for requirement, and I believe the language of the statute indicates that pretty clearly, because it doesn't simply say material fact in the abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.910" offset="4132412">It says procured by, not capable of being procured by, not could have been procured by, but procured by... very strong word.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.968" offset="4176612">And again as indicated by Justice Douglas, it was referred to in the other opinions, fraud and misrepresentations are strong words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.275" offset="4225826">Strong words require a vigorous burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.429" offset="4242440">They require a vigorous application before we vacate a judgment of a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.047" offset="4264905">And what the government is seeking is a soft definition of a harsh term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.635" offset="4287266">So to merely say it's important, I would suggest, does not do justice to the rights that are at stake here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.491" offset="4318718">These consequences of denaturalization are far more serious than fine and imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.545" offset="4338989">And I don't mean to trivialize fine and imprisonment, and I don't mean to trivialize the fact of lying.</text>

            <text syncTime="1054.499" offset="4370754">On the other hand, anytime that a person "lies" it doesn't necessarily mean that under any of the statutes the mere fact of lying results in consequences.</text>

            <text syncTime="1152.897" offset="4764367">When those situations at that time were reviewed by the court such as in the Tepper case, Judge Irving Kaufman indicated in that case the question is not whether or not the vice counsel would have decided that he lied, and therefore would have in effect denied the visa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.490" offset="4830718">The question is whether or not he had done so on a ground specifically excludable by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.978" offset="4848690">And the fact of the matter is that the regulation then in effect specifically stated that the grounds of exclusion are those grounds which are specifically listed in the application for the visa, and any law is not set forth there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.987" offset="4908667">What is set forth in the visa application refers to misrepresentation as to a material fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="1197.843" offset="4944089">Indeed, getting back to Justice Scalia's question about whether or not you could bring in other statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.913" offset="4972406">The fact of the matter is that the courts have never held that any lie even in those statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.817" offset="4996021">They have, in effect, engrafted a judge made interpretation of even 1001, but notwithstanding the language "any misstatement".</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.041" offset="5036876">It means, in effect, any material misstatement, so it excludes innocuous lies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.362" offset="5062163">In addition to which the courts have even accepted the question of the exculpatory no, because, for example, on this visa application what you had was the specific question, 18(c) I believe it was, have you ever in effect made any misrepresentations in order to gain benefits under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.394" offset="5158293">The simple answer is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.763" offset="5163831">The courts have engrafted into similar language under 1001, the defense that's not covered by it because otherwise in effect you would be violating the privilege against self-incrimination and other particular policy considerations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1616.267" offset="6617807">But, Mr. Klonoff, ordinarily when you are construing a statute such as 1451, the section we're talking about, where it covers quite elaborately the ground of misrepresentation as the basis for denaturalization, and then something else is there, illegal procurement, you would not think that illegal procurement embraced also misrepresentation which is elaborately covered in virtually the next sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1643.934" offset="6728461">Well, I have two answers for that, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.302" offset="6737970">First of all, as we have explained, the requirements for false testimony under illegal procurement are quite different than the requirements for material misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.392" offset="6774332">And there are category of cases in which the government could prove illegal procurement, but not material misrepresentation and vice-versa, and I'll get to that in a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.581" offset="6807038">The second point, however, is that that is simply not the way the legislative history suggests Congress was focusing on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.818" offset="6840056">The illegal procurement legislative history in 1961 reveals that Congress' purpose was to bring in all of the 1101(f).</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.292" offset="6881957">Now Mr. Williamson says that this court should pick and choose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.744" offset="6895750">But Congress said that 1101(f) defines who does not have good moral character, and Congress made clear in 1961 that individuals who lacked good moral character could be denaturalized under an illegal procurement theory.</text>

            <text syncTime="3041.114" offset="12317203">It has nothing to do with the issues here for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.983" offset="12328696">It wasn't a construction of 1451, and furthermore, I would urge the court to look at Landon v. Clark which we cite in our brief, the First Circuit case from 1956, which traces the law subsequent to Day, and indicates that even in the Second Circuit the court had backed away from any requirement of a dispositive fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.646" offset="12407377">And we would submit the law is quite clear as we have laid out in our brief, both before and after Chaunt, that the courts have not required a dispositive fact in order to establish materiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.787" offset="12455861">We would submit that there are several reasons why this court should reject the argument of the dispositive fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.124" offset="12485222">First of all, our interpretation is more consistent with the text of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.695" offset="12507583">If you were to require a dispositive fact under the material misrepresentation clause, that would essentially render that ground for denaturalization meaningless, because the government would have demonstrated illegal procurement in every case, and it would be entirely irrelevant whether the person lied or told the truth.</text>

            <text syncTime="3125.720" offset="12655645">If the court is going to retreat from those cases, then it's an open issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.838" offset="12676125">But we would submit that Fedorenko traces the law from Ginsberg to that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.242" offset="12697754">We would submit that that is the law; that illegal procurement dealt with someone who didn't possess the requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.996" offset="12720742">But that is true, our argument depends on that link.</text>

            <text syncTime="3284.305" offset="13290003">Let me say further though, we have argued throughout, and we are quite clear in our supplemental brief that testimony has its limited definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.544" offset="13322917">Petitioner has never quarreled with the government that he had given testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.864" offset="13344233">That's quite clear from the joint appendix, page 157, for example, dealing with the naturalization stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.451" offset="13378610">The testimony of the naturalization examiner is that the preliminary examiner would check off each question that was asked of the applicant under oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.409" offset="13418421">So we would submit that on that issue of whether there is testimony, there really hasn't been any dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3324.063" offset="13449036">We don't know, and again I would submit that I know of no case in which a court has required before it will accept the finding of fact that a district judge lay out in detail its understanding of testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.138" offset="13493340">We think testimony is a well established term in the case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.322" offset="13506087">We think the District Court's finding was supported by the evidence, and consequently, the court should not require that the district judge have given an analysis of what it means by testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.297" offset="13553944">We don't think a remand on that issue would be necessary, particularly since there really has been no dispute on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.301" offset="13581947">Finally, let me make this point in terms of the standard of proof of materiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.140" offset="13617369">Much of Petitioner's argument has rested on the theory that somehow if the court adopts that standard it's going to lead to unfairness in the immigration process that Justice Scalia's question seemed to references that people are going to be denaturalized for inconsequential lies, and that somehow there is going to be an unfairness in the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.970" offset="13700647">Let me point out, however, that since 1952 when the misrepresentation clause was enacted, 1451(a), the courts have almost unanimously interpreted materiality the way the government has urged, and after Chaunt, with the exception of the Tenth Circuit, they have continued to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.384" offset="13778283">So the test of materiality that the government has urged has been the law for over three decades, and we would submit--</text>

            <text syncTime="3464.470" offset="14010669">The key language which they say implied in that brief a coterminous requirement of materiality in illegal procurement was the phrase "to gain admission".</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.826" offset="14056017">I submit that there is no difference in kind between the phrase 1101(f)(6).</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.983" offset="14100739">So although the government wasn't addressing 1106 at that time, it was because of the fact that they recognized that the displaced person argument to gain admission equaled material.</text>

            <text syncTime="3539.268" offset="14309823">But getting back to Justice Scalia's question as to whether or not the court made a finding when it simply was, in effect, addressing itself to the question of the check mark on to gain admission, I think that the court in context was simply indicating that the same misrepresentation was repeated in the petition, because that was contained on page 120 of the Appendix C.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.134" offset="14405327">But if you go back to page 118, the court makes a finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.001" offset="14420791">It says,</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.585" offset="14423090">"I cannot understand what benefit defendant expected to achieve by placing his birth in Kaunas rather than Reistru, by dating his birth October 4, 1913 rather than September 21, 1915. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.528" offset="14478887">And the finding that had defendant given the correct information, his visa would have nevertheless been issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.730" offset="14495710">Later on in the opinion at page 123, the court simply reasserts that the government asserts that he lacked the prerequisite of good moral character because he gave false testimony for purpose of gaining benefits under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.804" offset="14547955">That's not a finding of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.156" offset="14553389">That's a conclusion of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.890" offset="14560285">It's an erroneous conclusion of law, because of the fact of the requirement materiality as perceived in Fedorenko.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.345" offset="14586094">In any event, there is no testimony presented by the government at the District Court level as to what the Petitioner's intent was at the time he made the misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.951" offset="14628517">There is, however, testimony as to why the Petitioner in German gave the documents that he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.723" offset="14659655">That is to say, why did he make everything consistent with his internal Lithuanian passport, and everything consistent with, and I'd point to the joint appendix, and the joint appendix is on page 29, Exhibit 1(s).</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.409" offset="14774385">That's the Lithuanian ex-political prison's certificate dated June 18, 1946, and the significance of that certificate was explained in the testimony at the District Court level that the purpose why the Lithuanian committee in the camps were giving these certificates is because the Soviet representatives on the committee were screening applicants for purposes of expatriation to the Soviet Union, or taking them out of the camps.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.538" offset="14846901">And this further exhibit on page 69, Exhibit 53(d), in which it confirms that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.025" offset="14868843">This is the letter of the War Department, Special Staff, Civil Division, and it refers to,</text>
