            <text syncTime="65.286" offset="393093">The paternity case is not like an ordinary civil case about money, as my opponents would have you believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.752" offset="422977">A paternity case is not like a collection case or a slip and fall case.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.313" offset="441158">If you look at the effects of the judgment entered and the parties involved, you will see the difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="87.168" offset="480551">This is not a judgment which is enforced just against the debtor's property, but it is enforced against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.651" offset="510540">Once the order is entered, the court monitors his address and his employment for the remainder of the effect of that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.772" offset="538961">There is a wage attachment provision, and this is a provision that does not exist in any other civil judgments in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.768" offset="571039">Week to week, paycheck to paycheck, the effect of this judgment is felt.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.937" offset="595699">There is no relief in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.452" offset="605730">The defendant loses the freedom to change his employment based on a court's perception of his earning capacity.</text>

            <text syncTime="131.401" offset="657557">He can't bankrupt out of this judgment, but none of these deal with the most important effect of this judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.820" offset="683157">This judgment makes a permanent decision as to who is the father of this child.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.145" offset="708548">The parties involved... I will get back to that.</text>

            <text syncTime="149.549" offset="730073">Plaintiff's interest, as my opponents concede, is purely economic, getting money.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.156" offset="748567">But the child has what has been termed in Little versus Streeter as a compelling interest in the accuracy of the determination and so does the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.638" offset="782422">The government weighs in heavily on the side of the plaintiff in every support and paternity case, not just the welfare cases, as here, but through the 4D program, this plaintiff and all plaintiffs in support actions have been afforded postponed and reduced filing fees, streamlined pleading systems, subsidized costs of prosecution, and there are two examples in this case which are of particular interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.330" offset="885240">In this case the government provided the plaintiff with an attorney and the government flew in the blood test expert for the trial at no cost to the plaintiff.</text>

            <text syncTime="1040.488" offset="4293906">This Court is required to correct clear constitutional violations in state statutes in order to ensure constitutional fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.266" offset="4332985">An analysis of the due process clause as it relates to the preponderant standard of proof in a paternity proceeding demonstrates that there is no clear constitutional violation in the state's choice of this particular evidentiary standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.743" offset="4398918">Furthermore, the preponderance standard of the evidence in this context assures fairness to all the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.725" offset="4430788">Appellant's main contention is that his rights are the same as the parents in Santosky versus Kramer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.564" offset="4474151">Appellant argues that his lack of parental ties are as deserving of the sane constitutional protection at those parents who had formed a parent-child relationship with their children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.260" offset="4532979">This is incorrect as a general proposition, Fully developed familial relationships involving the assumption of parental duties with mutual love and affection are entitled to a significantly greater level of due process protection than the inchoate relationship at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.487" offset="4621900">No court can impose a parent-child relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.579" offset="4642275">The only thing a court can impose is a support order, and that would mean monetary support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.857" offset="4675398">Practically, the interests at stake in a paternity suit are economic on the parts of all the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.680" offset="4710611">To distinguish Santosky from the case at bar, in Santosky the court was clearly speaking about, as I have already stated, an already established familial relationship with mutual love and affection and a day to day caretaking role on the part of the parents with their children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.345" offset="4785322">In Santosky the state was pitted against the parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.827" offset="4807264">The state came in with both feet upon those parents, I will grant you that, In this case, I submit that these interests deal with private parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.699" offset="4846762">The state is there to facilitate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.698" offset="4854703">The state is there to give a mother an attorney should she need one, if she is on welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.101" offset="4880303">The state in Pennsylvania is also there to give an indigent father an attorney via the public defender system, As far as the HLA blood tests, no one any more since Little versus Streeter is denied that opportunity to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.563" offset="4946131">Anyone in the United States can get HLA blood tests regardless of their financial or their economic status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.201" offset="4976747">The liberty interest at stake in Santosky, as this Court said, could be extinguished forever as a result of this termination proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.978" offset="5019797">Here there is no liberty interest at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.710" offset="5030768">Here there are no familial ties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.303" offset="5041113">The only interests at stake are economic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.708" offset="5050726">In Santosky the Court said the child will lose the right of support and maintenance from their parents forever upon the termination of parental rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.266" offset="5104956">So what the Court did was, they raised the standard in order to prevent this, in order to protect the child's interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.904" offset="5131496">What the appellant is asking you to do here, they are asking for the child to lose the rights to support and maintenance forever, and they are asking you to raise the standard to cause this result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.478" offset="5177785">I submit to you that that result would be unfair and inapposite to what Santosky holds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.678" offset="5202654">In Santosky the Court balances the parents' and the child's interests against the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.080" offset="5232224">It decided that the parents' and the child's interests were served by a higher standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.782" offset="5255003">In this case the parents, the father in particular, comes in as an adversary to the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.654" offset="5282589">The Court is asked to balance these interests as adversaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.825" offset="5299202">In Santosky for the majority of the Court the issue was familial bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.401" offset="5325534">For the dissent in Santosky, the issue was the safety of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.414" offset="5345596">I submit that the concerns of both the majority and the dissent in Santosky were for the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.082" offset="5372241">I would ask this Court to take this case on those terms as well and to consider the child's interests as you did in Santosky.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.235" offset="5404842">The issue in this case, I will repeat, is the monetary support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.155" offset="5428561">In Santoksy the issue was imprecise substantive standards which left determinations open to the subjective values of one particular judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.042" offset="5476104">In Santosky you mentioned the issues of cultural bias because most of these parents happened to come from poor economic statuses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.305" offset="5509122">You mentioned the issue of... there were other issues that you mentioned, the state being able to form the case from the very beginning against the parents and how you as a Court felt that was unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.611" offset="5562412">In this case the decision is left to either one judge or to a jury of 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.640" offset="5590520">In this particular case the decision was left to a jury of 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.077" offset="5604208">It as civil proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.812" offset="5611209">We did not need to have a unanimous decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.342" offset="5621240">However, we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.607" offset="5626360">The HLAs were provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.200" offset="5636704">That is not an imprecise substantive standard, That is empirical medical evidence which is based on the evidence as it comes into the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.634" offset="5666484">Another important issue in Santosky was this Court's concern that the significant prospect of an erroneous termination existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.049" offset="5728133">I submit that in this case there is a small prospect of an erroneous decision due to the medical advancements that we have made in genetic testing, and one of those tests happens to be the HLAs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.826" offset="5779229">I would also like to distinguish Little versus Streeter because I feel that is a very important case when it comes to our case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.634" offset="5822487">You used the word, this Court used the word "compelling interests" of both the father and the child in Little versus Streeter, and I believe that the interests were in the accuracy of the determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.752" offset="5878912">I submit that your decision to allow the HLAs to have them accessible to everyone involved cleared up the problem, and I submit it is just one piece of the problem in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.779" offset="5931052">The HLAs provide empirical scientific evidence they reduce an erroneous determination greatly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.525" offset="5970027">There is no longer one person's word against another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.664" offset="5982566">If the red blood cell tests are run and the man is excluded, the state does not even bring any kind of a paternity suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.693" offset="6014644">No suit is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.566" offset="6018197">If the HLAs are then run, if the man is not excluded by the red blood cell tests an HLA test is run and then the father would be included to a greater percent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1493.027" offset="6103983">Your Honor, I hesitate to answer that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.166" offset="6116626">I have seen them based on different genetic factors to be very high if the parties involved have very rare genetic characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.382" offset="6149436">In this case evidently the genetic characteristics were not all that rare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.897" offset="6163542">I also understand that because the mother was a white Caucasian and the father was of Hispanic dissent that the statistical tables that were used did not allow the PhDs that figure out the statistical results to come up with as high perhaps a standard as they might have had there been two white people involved or two black people involved or something like that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.699" offset="6254762">In Little versus Streeter I submit that the father, the putative father was denied due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.523" offset="6289975">I think it was a horrendous denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.725" offset="6302827">The odds were stacked against that father.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.240" offset="6316933">That is not the facts here, I submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.708" offset="6326755">The facts here, as far as fairness in procedure, this father as well as the mother and child were given the right to a hearing before a domestic relations hearing officer at which time paternity could be acknowledged or denied if paternity was denied the HLA blood tests become a standard procedure then.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.637" offset="6406481">They are automatically ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.558" offset="6410138">The parties appear for HLA blood tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.777" offset="6419020">After the HLA blood tests are returned the father has another hearing before a domestic relations hearing officer, an officer of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.275" offset="6452979">At that time once again he may deny or acknowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.055" offset="6464159">If he continues to deny after the HLA blood tests have included him to a large percentage he has the choice of a jury trial or a bench trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.565" offset="6502193">That choice may be made by the mother as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.862" offset="6511389">She could have opted for a jury or bench trial as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="2103.485" offset="8545909">The issue then is whether the preponderance standard fairly allocates the risk of an erroneous factfinding between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.886" offset="8579451">The answer is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.699" offset="8586765">The interests of the father are economic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.666" offset="8594602">The interests of the child are economic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.338" offset="8601289">The interests of the mother are economic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.321" offset="8609230">The interests are therefore of equivalent constitutional significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.789" offset="8627098">The mandate for placing a greater burden on one party stems from the recognition that the other party has a constitutionally protected interest of greater import at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.989" offset="8663878">The mandate therefore is negated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.863" offset="8675372">The interests are of equal significance and are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.705" offset="8686762">Since the interests are the same how would the due process clause have the risk of error allocated?</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.404" offset="8717586">A higher burden of proof serves no useful constitutional purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.355" offset="8737335">Any advantage accorded to one party by changing the standard of proof imposes a corresponding disadvantage on the other parties, in this case the child and the mother and the state somewhat.</text>

            <text syncTime="2246.100" offset="9116319">There is no principle basis for contending that the child is better served by decreasing the risk of erroneous findings of paternity at the cost of increasing the risk of erroneous findings of nonpaternity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2273.620" offset="9226451">I think they are important enough that perhaps I should reiterate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.416" offset="9237632">The Rules of Civil Procedure require that appellant receive proper notice upon the filing of a paternity suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2291.347" offset="9297295">He is afforded the right to a bench or a jury trial and then 12 of his peers would sit to hear the evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2301.515" offset="9337942">Appellant therefore is afforded the essence of due process, the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.463" offset="9377753">The suit is comparable to a negligence suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2318.665" offset="9406592">The parties here are more private that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.241" offset="9416936">In fact, not all paternity suits have state involvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.006" offset="9431983">Only those in which the child is on welfare have state involvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.707" offset="9446716">Some would argue, as appellant has, that the state is putting pressure on the mother to put the finger on someone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.220" offset="9468763">Perhaps that is how some people view it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.782" offset="9479003">I submit, however, a fairer way to view it is, the state is watching out for the child's best interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.921" offset="9499588">In some instances the child and mother may assume somewhat of an adversarial role.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.216" offset="9520799">The mother may still care for the father and not wish to jeopardize that relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.996" offset="9539921">The father may be paying some voluntary support and the mother may not wish to jeopardize that support.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.087" offset="9560296">The mother may be very young and intimidated by the legal proceeding or the legal system, precluding her from taking any steps to establish the civil legal relationship between the child and the father.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.410" offset="9605540">Furthermore, the state does have a responsibility to the taxpayers of the state to recoup some of the money that is being used to support a child that is born out of wedlock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.720" offset="9646814">I would therefore ask that for the state of Pennsylvania that this Court affirm the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and hold that the preponderance of evidence standard of proof chosen by Pennsylvania and 41 other states to be used in paternity suits does not violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="2423.436" offset="9825700">A few brief remarks in rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.185" offset="9836672">First of all, the quote from Webber was very nice, but what is at question here is not an irresponsible liaison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.728" offset="9866869">The question is, did it ever happen, and did it result in a parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.399" offset="9881498">So those cases have nothing to do with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.898" offset="9891529">Those cases and the adoption cases involve people who say they are the father and the children's rights and the fathers' rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.630" offset="9922458">That has nothing to do with the determining whether or not someone actually is the father of a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.970" offset="9943774">Chief Justice Rehnquist, you asked whether an 18 to 1 odds was a low likelihood or a high likelihood or what could it be, and as I pointed out there is no statute saying below a certain result you can't admit the results, but in the AMA-ABA study which I believe this Court is familiar with due to the numerous times it has been cited there is a table showing degrees of likelihood, and starting with practically proved, extremely likely, very likely, and in the 90 to 95 percent range, which is where the 18 to 1 falls, it says likely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.124" offset="10120466">I think the Court should be aware of that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2503.217" offset="10144812">That's right, but in this case, just another example of why there is tough evidence in this case, in this case I tried to show that Gregg's, my client's brother, had opportunity and access to have sex... this was one of the contentions we were trying to show... that he had sex with her, so he could be the father, and as indicated in the reporter cases and could have been in this case, blood test results don't mean anything else if somebody else had sex with the woman who was related.</text>
