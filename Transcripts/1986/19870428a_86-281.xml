            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>
            <text syncTime="2151.433" offset="8740933">It would be if he were right in his analysis of his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.271" offset="8760264">Let's suppose that his case involved just two counts, the two substantive counts, and did not involve the conspiracy count.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.241" offset="8784192">If that were the case, his first count on which his conviction was affirmed involved one gram of cocaine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.710" offset="8806030">The second count, which the Court of Appeals vacated, involved the six ounces, the substantive count.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.883" offset="8830690">That would have made a big difference in his parole disposition and under the Rubin case and other authorities that would have been enough to require that the Court of Appeals review that second count.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.690" offset="8877919">However, in this case the conspiracy count, as the Court of Appeals analyzed it itself, involved precisely the same conduct that was at issue in the substantive counts, and in fact Mr. Ray agreed specifically in an admission that was part of the record to obtain the cocaine that was on order, said that he had three ounces himself and would go find some more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.726" offset="9006128">That is plenty of evidence to support the conspiracy count, conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute ten ounces of cocaine or at least six ounces of cocaine, and under the parole guidelines a conspiracy is rated the same as the substantive offense even if there is an acquittal on the substantive offense, so that he is in the same boat if he is convicted on the conspiracy as if he is convicted on the substantive offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.960" offset="9111036">He is... if it weren't for the conspiracy count he would be in a different position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.864" offset="9130680">But our position is that he is stuck on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.435" offset="9160982">The one which point he made in his argument which is correct is that the Parole Board did not acknowledge that the Court of Appeals had thrown out, vacated, or whatever it had done, the one count, the Count 3, and the Parole Board went ahead and reviewed this case as if there had been a sustained conviction on the third count.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.104" offset="9271637">Now that, I think, was a mistake, but our position is, he would be in exactly the same position by virtue of the conspiracy count, so that mistake is immaterial to his position, and of course in any event our position is that they are not concurrent sentences in this case and therefore all of that becomes immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.950" offset="9358990">If there are no further questions, I have nothing to add.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.385" offset="9364737">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="2311.854" offset="9382605">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.337" offset="9384590">I just want to address two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.606" offset="9389606">Justice Stevens, you asked about other cases in the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.158" offset="9399846">I have got a couple of them on my brief on Page 89 and 90.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.527" offset="9413325">Montemayor was a big drug case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.479" offset="9421162">I think the man got about 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.512" offset="9429207">And Cardona was the first time the Fifth Circuit used the vacation of convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.299" offset="9448434">In the Fifth Circuit's own opinion they cite another one or two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.918" offset="9462853">ABI is the name of one defendant, but they have been doing it since at least 1981, and now the Eleventh Circuit has picked it up from its sister circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.857" offset="9498589">The other thing I would like to address is the last point that counsel was making.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.225" offset="9512068">At the Parole Commission Mr. Ray will be responsible for the six-ounce delivery because that is part of the conspiracy, and therefore when it is all over the Parole Commission has done the right thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.889" offset="9586778">That is the contention of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.339" offset="9592525">I think that is wrong, and let me call the Court's attention to... one CFR we didn't bring to you, but it is 28 CFR 2.20, which is the normal one on parole, and then under Chapter 13 there is one called Number 4, and it talks about the vicarious liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.268" offset="9660234">And it reminds one of the Pinkerton case that this Court decided in 1946 about vicarious liability, and I will get to that in a second.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.771" offset="9690327">But that particular CFR reads,</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.139" offset="9699731">"The prisoner is held accountable for his own actions and actions done in concert with others. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.943" offset="9727003">"However, the prisoner is not to be held accountable for activities committed by associates over which the prisoner has no control and could not have been reasonably expected to foresee. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.970" offset="9783114">So the only evidence in the record that Mr. Ray is responsible... from which that inference or speculation could be drawn is set out on my brief at Page 20, and may I read that to you, because I don't think it is enough to get there even at the Parole Commission, and so Mr. Ray... that is where we differ with the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.866" offset="9858660">Mr. Ray will not be held accountable because he could not reasonably expect to foresee that Sandoval would find six ounces and make the delivery the following day, it being our contention Ray is not the supplier of those six ounces.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.793" offset="9922399">The quote from the record, and this is Mr. Molina talking... he is the informer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.262" offset="9940267">He is on the stand, and he's telling the jury the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.149" offset="9955836">Sandoval advised Ray about this person that was willing to buy ten ounces of cocaine, and then quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.720" offset="9978092">"and that this person was requesting ten ounces, and they weren't sure if they could come up with the ten ounces but they had three ounces is what I heard John say. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.658" offset="10017798">my client,</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.508" offset="10021247">"and that they would have to go back and see if they could get the rest. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.229" offset="10036084">And that is the extent of Mr. Ray's involvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.014" offset="10047265">I got three ounces, I'll see if I can get any more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.216" offset="10060117">Now, we don't know whether we got any more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.999" offset="10067222">We don't know if Sandoval got the rest... got all six ounces from a third supplier or he got half from Mr. Ray, half from somebody else, and yet the government... that little statement there is enough for the government to say my client is involved in a six-ounce conspiracy when the actual conspiracy pled in this case is... it doesn't say how many ounces.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.880" offset="10142768">It just says a quantity of cocaine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.499" offset="10153217">And so they want that to cover both Counts 1 and 2.</text>
