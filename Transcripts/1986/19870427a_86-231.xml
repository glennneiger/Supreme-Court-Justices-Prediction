            <text syncTime="107.802" offset="579682">Now, when Congress enacted withdrawal liability in 1980 it knew that there are literally thousands of withdrawals from the thousands of multiemployer pension plans in the United States every year, and that it would be difficult if not impossible to set up a Federal bureaucracy to assess and collect these amounts, so it assigned to the trustees of the pension plans the practical task of formulating the initial claims for this liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="475.041" offset="2048704">Because the plan's calculation involves a large number of steps, and the plan would have to come forward and establish the reasonableness of every actuarial assumption, the accuracy of every underlying data, and inapplicability of every exemption provision set forth in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.186" offset="2117249">Congress was concerned that that would be an invitation to employers to lodge vague or nominal challenges or general challenges just to put the plan through the many days, perhaps even weeks of expensive testimony, documentary evidence, and the like that would be necessary to establish the reasonableness of the original claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.198" offset="2197288">Congress decided it would make more sense to have the claim serve essentially as a target at which the employer could take aim at those issues which we had a substantial disagreement, and I should note that in the arbitration proceeding there is no limitation on the issues the employer can raise, no limitation on the facts he may adduce.</text>

            <text syncTime="573.590" offset="2442839">Justice O'Connor, let me state at the outset my agreement that the language is at least curious.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.660" offset="2467186">It is ambiguous in our view and internally inconsistent, and not merely for the reason that you refer to, but also because the language, and this is at Page 65A of our jurisdictional statement, melds a trial type standard, preponderance of the evidence, which is generally understood to mean greater weight of the evidence or more probable than not, with words which appear in Rule 52, an appellate standard, clearly erroneous, which is generally understood again to this Court's decisions in Anderson against the City of Bessemer and so on, to mean that the Appellate Court has a firm and definite conviction that error has been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.118" offset="2628936">Now, we consider, first of all, the melding of the trial type standard with the appellate standard to be an inconsistency in itself, and second, the preponderance standard, to show that something is more likely than not, is a somewhat lower standard in suggesting that the Appellate Court had a firm and definite conviction that error has been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.651" offset="2715140">We suggest in view of the legislative history, also in view of the related provisions of the statute which this must be interpreted alongside, and in view of the possibility of avoiding a somewhat more difficult constitutional question, that the Court construe that language to require the employer to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the plan's determination was unreasonable or incorrect, in other words, that it not give the clearly erroneous language, the strict Rule 52 gloss.</text>

            <text syncTime="800.805" offset="3351692">What makes sense about interpreting the preceding provision to require a more preponderance showing by the employer of error is that the District Court in 1401(c) is reviewing for whether something is correct or not and it would make no sense to have the District Court look for mere error if the arbitrator is applying a clearly erroneous standard, which is a much narrower scope of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.420" offset="3446150">Your scope of review on appeal would be expanding instead of decreasing, and that makes no sense to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.472" offset="3466421">Now, there were two other policy reasons that Congress had in mind when it enacted these presumptions besides the preventing abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.065" offset="3516786">The second was, as it noted in the legislative history, on these exemption provisions which were made much of in the papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.302" offset="3545729">It is the employer that has the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.504" offset="3554506">The facts are in the employer's control.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.537" offset="3562657">This Court has noted in other decisions when you claim an exemption from the statutory provision it is traditional that you have the burden of proof and it makes a lot of practical sense if the employer has the evidence that is relevant to that exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.930" offset="3612185">And finally, Congress wanted at least modestly to encourage uniform treatment of similarly situated employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.802" offset="3651682">These pension plans are amalgamations of a lot of different employers who may many of them be competitors, and the glue that holds them together is the sense that everyone in the plan is being treated the same, evenhandedly, and the presumption, while not guaranteeing that in every case, goes some distance in discouraging arbitrators from issuing inconsistent compromise awards that could undo the basic cohesion of the multiemployer pension plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="2582.177" offset="10477164">Now, I would like to turn to why the trustees have a conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.014" offset="10500570">First of all, they have an adverse legal duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.616" offset="10511019">The plan, the plan involved in this case concedes that the trustees are biased.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.805" offset="10539754">It says at Page 30 of its main brief that</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.940" offset="10556263">"The bias of the trustees is permissible because the trustees are obligated by Congress to be biased in favor of pension plans. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.696" offset="10587297">Now, that may be... that may be all to the good, but the plan concedes that they are biased, but the plan goes on to say at the same page, Page 30 of their main brief,</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.017" offset="10620524">"By its very nature an assessment of withdrawal liability is intended to benefit the interests of the plan over those of a withdrawing employer. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.389" offset="10654066">What that amounts to is nothing more than this Court has said in Amax Coal, which is that the trustees owe an exclusive duty to the beneficiaries, which excludes any consideration of anyone else, including employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.898" offset="10708087">Now, the trustees also have a duty to ensure full funding, and while it is quite true, as the PBGC points out, that they may not get sued in any individual withdrawal liability case for having failed to collect the maximum, if they don't perform their duty over a period of time to ensure full funding they have got a risk, and they have got a risk of personal fiduciary liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.831" offset="10799829">That is what they are there for, is to protect the beneficiaries by ensuring full funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.033" offset="10820622">And in that sense this case is just like Ward versus Monroeville, were the mayor had executive responsibility for the finances of a town.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.923" offset="10860224">These trustees have executive responsibility for the finances of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.808" offset="10875688">Now, second, the employer trustees have an adverse financial interest, and the PBGC concedes that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.712" offset="10903378">The PBGC at Page... at... I am sorry, it is not in its brief, it is in a Federal regulation which is cited in our brief at Page 14, it is 50 Federal Register 34680, PBGC says,</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.741" offset="10967430">"Interests of employers that will withdraw in the future are materially different from those of employers who will not withdraw. "</text>

            <text syncTime="2716.715" offset="11015391">The more that the staying employers can assess from the leaving employers, the less the staying employers are going to have to pay of that liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="3356.112" offset="13572988">Let me note at the outset an important concession that counsel made, and that is that one of the three fundamental bases of the Third Circuit's decision, that is, that the allocation method selection by the trustees was an adjudicative decision, was incorrect, and the appellees agree with the PBGC that it is not an adjudicative decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.409" offset="13654177">Also, the appellees have largely conceded the actuarial matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.879" offset="13676015">They have noted that the standard, the substantive standard enacted by Congress was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.117" offset="13697017">They have noted further that in answer to a question that there may be a case by case determination of the actuarial interest rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.806" offset="13731708">We respectfully disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.423" offset="13738186">This case does not present those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.675" offset="13747173">We are aware of no plan in which the actuarial work has been anything other than planwide and applied evenhandedly to all withdrawn employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.447" offset="13778310">And the statute itself says that they may use the same assumptions for withdrawn employers as they use for ongoing employers, and the Controller General's report states that about two-thirds of them do just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.588" offset="13826898">Now, as to the application of exemption provisions in formulating the initial claim of the plan we would respectfully suggest that this case involves much more limited discretion on the part of the trustees than, for example, the administrator in Marshall against Jericho, who applied broad standards in formulating, determining whether there had been a violation of the child labor laws in formulating claims under the child labor laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.608" offset="13946957">There are detailed provisions set forth in what the Court has called before this comprehensive and reticulated statute, and the suggestion that in merely formulating a civil claim, not deciding one, but formulating one, that they are transformed into judges or like judges, would surprise both the trustees and most of the parties to these plans as well as the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.537" offset="14034624">Now, finally, as to bias, there is no full funding requirement for these plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.675" offset="14055208">There is a mechanical rule set forth in Section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code, and if they meet that mechanical rule or if they obtain a waiver from the rule from the IRS, they have satisfied the basic funding requirements for a pension plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.083" offset="14104841">So standing alone, full funding is not a requirement for a fiduciary under one of these plans and therefore there is not... that may explain why in all the life of the statute there has not been a single suit brought challenging the decisions of the trustees and formulating these withdrawal liability claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.460" offset="14174327">The notion that they are somehow exposed to suit as fiduciaries for funding or other reasons in formulating a withdrawal liability claim is something that occurs entirely in the realm of theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.752" offset="14219466">Now, they have no pecuniary or personal interest of the sort this Court has found offensive in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.239" offset="14245484">They receive salaries if they are paid at all that are not contingent upon their performance in collecting withdrawal liability claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.178" offset="14273174">Withdrawal liability is typically a very small percentage of the revenues of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.547" offset="14290728">They have an interest and bias, if you will, in carrying out faithfully the provisions of law that Congress has assigned them to carry out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.069" offset="14324792">No different from the school board in the Hortonville School District case, and no different from the optometric board in Freeman against Rogers, where this Court has upheld the choice of the state legislatures in assigning that task to people who believe in that law and will faithfully carry it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.697" offset="14391248">And the suggestion that they bring to their job as trustees, as fiduciaries, personal interests as employers or as unions is unsubstantiated on this record, and reads into oblivion this Court's decision in the Amax Coal Case, which in fact trustees generally truly endeavor to follow.</text>
