            <text syncTime="54.468" offset="359594">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="59.622" offset="380179">This case comes forward on appeal from the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, holding unconstitutional a statute of the United States as applied to nonprofit ideological corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.398" offset="439320">The statute in question, that was held unconstitutional, is the provision of the federal code regulating the means by which corporations and labor organizations participate in federal elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.439" offset="491460">The court found the statute unconstitutional because it requires that all expenditures in connection with a federal election be made from fund explicitly and voluntarily given for that purpose, kept separate from all other funds of these organizations, and publicly reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.935" offset="569410">The facts of the case are fairly straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.304" offset="582889">The corporation in question is the Massachusetts Citizens for Life, a non-membership corporation under Massachusetts law whose central purpose is to foster respect for human life and to defend the right to human life, all human beings, born and unborn.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.064" offset="645896">It has carried out its purposes by raising funds and contributions which it uses to further its purposes through dissemination of information, education, and legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.955" offset="693544">It does this in large part through a newsletter which it distributes.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="141.693" offset="708486">It is now a membership corporation, am I correct about that?</text>
            <text syncTime="144.910" offset="721338">At the time the events at issue here occurred it was not, but it now is?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_n_steele" startTime="149.012" stopTime="305.778">
            <label>Mr. Charles N. Steele</label>
            <text syncTime="149.012" offset="737743">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.428" offset="739415">The record seems to reflect that from the discussions.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.047" offset="749864">After 1978 it became a membership corporation, apparently.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.349" offset="767104">The Massachusetts Citizens for Life in 1978, September of 1978, before the Massachusetts primary, distributed an election flyer, labeled a special election edition flyer, which proclaimed that it had in it everything you need to vote pro-life, set forth the MCFL's positions on several issues, indicated the positions in relationship to some 400 candidates, all federal candidates and state candidates, urged the recipients to vote pro-life, depicted some of them with pictures, those who supported the pro-life position.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.957" offset="925511">The question before this Court is whether Congress can require that the funds used for such advocacy can be separate... can be required to be separate and segregated from the funds which consist only of voluntary contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.637" offset="1000221">The court below concluded that the statute in question restricted the simplest method by which Massachusetts Citizens for Life could achieve its advocacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.611" offset="1052153">It said that there was a burden on the rights of speech and association because of the requirement of establishing the separate segregated fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.817" offset="1084962">Before going on to the reasoning of the court, I would like to note explicitly three things that it did not decide:</text>
            <text syncTime="242.871" offset="1113175">It did not decide that the statute prohibited the speech in question, but only that it burdened it;--</text>
            <text syncTime="249.525" offset="1139820">It did not decide that the statute prohibited the distribution of voting records, nor even that the statute required that voting records be distributed through the mechanism of a separate, segregated fund;--</text>
            <text syncTime="262.784" offset="1192796">And it did not prohibit this organization or any other similar organization from distributing in a newsletter to its members voting records which advocated the election and the defeat of candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.776" offset="1244832">What it did hold was that Congress cannot for express advocacy in elections require that any material that is disseminated to the general public, not distributed in the way that a message ordinarily is by an organization, can be required to be from a separately segregated fund, from a fund which apprises everyone that the contributions to it will be used in connection with specific federal elections--</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="305.778" offset="1364786">I take it it's the organization that apprises the people, not the fund?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_n_steele" startTime="309.765" stopTime="384.547">
            <label>Mr. Charles N. Steele</label>
            <text syncTime="309.765" offset="1380773">--Yes, the organization in making the solicitations... those can be done by the organization, would be done by the organization, and they would be the ones that apprised them of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.173" offset="1434376">There are three policies underlying the Act which we think that the court's decision goes against.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.880" offset="1477217">First of all, if the court's decision stands the disclosure aspects of the Act are substantially undercut.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.384" offset="1507206">Again, there are really three purposes put forward by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.955" offset="1521521">One of them is the disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.922" offset="1529357">It has been argued here that the section in question, Section 441(b), whose antecedent goes back to the Federal Corrupt Practices Act, is not a disclosure statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.746" offset="1572616">It does, however, specifically set forth that the corporations' and labor organizations' separate segregated funds are political committees and subjects them therefore to the same requirements that all political committees are required under the Federal Election Campaign Act regarding disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.541" offset="1639803">And if the court's decision were to stand, that disclosure of where money is spent and where it comes from would be considerably lessened.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.897" offset="1673240">The second policy--</text>

            <text syncTime="384.547" offset="1679823">Could Congress require that the publisher of a newspaper along with every edition of the newspaper list all the stockholders of the newspaper?</text>

            <text syncTime="393.986" offset="1717648">--I think Congress felt that it would not do that and, in light of the First Amendment, did not do that, and there was an explicit statutory exception.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="401.973" stopTime="406.293">

            <text syncTime="403.692" offset="1756414">Would a requirement like that be constitutional?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Charles N. Steele</label>
            <text syncTime="406.293" offset="1766863">I think that would be a very difficult requirement to uphold.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="409.078" stopTime="411.114">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>

            <label>Mr. Charles N. Steele</label>
            <text syncTime="411.114" offset="1786089">Because here the purposes of the organization are... again, I think one of the questions here would be, if the purpose of this organization had been to distribute newsletters by subscription and so forth and that was its regular business, that there would be that question there.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.909" offset="1857351">This, however, seems to us crosses over the line from the operation of a newspaper in that sense to pure election advocacy, and that in that sense the Congress is balancing there between two different issues, one of those issues being whether election advocacy in the sense of urging the election or defeat of particular individuals can be financed directly from a corporation's funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.393" offset="1963304">They did not prohibit that speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.093" offset="1970095">They merely said that that should be done through a separate, segregated fund and prescribed the methods for having that fund operated and required the public disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.367" offset="2011160">But again, that is not a prohibition of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.153" offset="2022340">Now, whether the same disclosure for a newspaper... again, I think that there would be a substantial question there, but I think that it could be argued that disclosure of the sources of a newspaper's funding was constitutionally permissible so long as it involved no particular restriction on what the newspaper would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.297" offset="2102902">Laws of general application, going back to the Grosjean case and other cases of that applied to newspapers, would be, could be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.803" offset="2136861">But I don't think that question is here before the Court, certainly not on the basis of the Court of Appeals' decision, because the Court of Appeals' decision explicitly found that this was not the operation of Massachusetts Citizens for Life's newsletter.</text>

            <text syncTime="572.184" offset="2430373">Assuming that the hypothetical related to a corporation, the Commission has explicitly set forth that if voting records were published in a non-partisan fashion it would not consider those to be in connection with a federal election.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.444" offset="2487424">The question here, as the court below found, is not the publication of such voting records, but voting records explicitly combined with express advocacy.</text>

            <text syncTime="606.607" offset="2568091">In effect, I think what is centrally at issue here with regard to this case is what we see as essentially a purpose of Congress in establishing a prophylactic rule with regard to particular types of organizations... corporations and labor organizations.</text>

            <text syncTime="648.600" offset="2736110">And of course, as we've said, we think the fact that it is an 80 year old statute which has been passed back and forth through Congress many times gives some weight to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.140" offset="2774249">But if you go back to the '47 debates which we have set forth, we think that the debates there and the eventual results, and indeed the legislative hearings that led up to that statute, make it quite clear that the sponsors of that Act, particularly Senator Taft, were focusing on this question of all corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.352" offset="2847078">We have set forth in footnotes to our briefs several organizations with which the 1946 hearings had been concerned, which were quite clearly non-profit ideological organizations in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.142" offset="2890233">Senator Taft in discussing the legislation on the floor of the Senate was asked numerous questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.796" offset="2920848">A large number of those were set out in this Court's decision in United States versus CIO.</text>

            <text syncTime="713.793" offset="2996812">And they were drawing, in that sense, and Senator Taft was drawing in the discussions a very precise line relating to the existence or not or whether it was a corporation or a labor organization within the meaning of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1358.608" offset="5576143">Well, I think that the Congressional judgment is that it's not merely the working hard, that it is the relationship of the money that increases that indebtedness, and that there is in their mind a very similar relationship there between the actual contribution under control and the expenditure of money for the same purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.070" offset="5649913">And indeed, that was the purpose of the '47 legislation, was to reach that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.872" offset="5669139">And they were very clear, and I think that in regard to that that in this case, in canvasing the CIO and the UAW cases, recognized there that those were not alleged to be coordinated expenditures, but that those were expenditures that came within the meaning of the Act, and upheld in the UAW case the indictment there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1411.507" offset="5787735">Well, really I think that all three, the three that I was going to mention, come under I think the general heading of corruption, because I think what Congress was saying was that the voluntariness, the individual choice which is protected in the statute, was clearly an important policy; in other words, that the statute, 441(b), makes it clear that in soliciting contributions to these funds that they have to apprise them of the fact that they are going to be used for political purposes, "political purposes" there meaning explicit election-related purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.695" offset="5912495">And the third, the third purpose which I have touched on, but not in that direct sense, was the very choice that Congress was making, I think, that in effect that it was a prophylactic rule, that it would use a term such as "corporations" and not seek... a very neutral term, as I say... and not seek to have an individualized ascertainment of whether or not there was corruption in a particular transaction, would not seek to decide whether a particular corporation was threatening to the process, but would do it in a form of a classification that was as neutral as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.582" offset="6048019">And it seems to me that was a very important Congressional purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="2603.042" offset="10553828">Here's the information on which you may live up to your principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.596" offset="10572113">The newsletter was started as the most important activity of this organization, and has been published since its first one in 1973, maybe four to eight times a years as funds would allow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.490" offset="10647660">Whenever there was as election year, the organization would come out with a special election edition, gathering the votes as it did here, or the statements of position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.132" offset="10694157">As to the constitutional arguments, Section 441 implicates freedom of expression, freedom of association, and freedom of the press: freedom of expression because speech concerning the qualification of candidates or elected officials goes to the heart of the First Amendment's concerns and supports an enlightened electorate; freedom of association because the ability of like-minded individuals to gather together and communicate to the outside world, enhancing the weak voices of the members, goes to the heart of the American way of life and American history, especially where the message concerns those who would be our leaders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.863" offset="10885165">Freedom of the press is implicated because that cherished freedom applies to the humblest handbills handed out on a corner by Tom Payne equally with the slick products of our modern dailies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.920" offset="10937410">Freedom of the press is not a captive of the media conglomerates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.222" offset="10954546">The first Circuit has held that, although the statute applies, overruling three reasons that the district court found the statute should not be deemed to apply, still the statute was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.584" offset="11020061">And legislation which implicates those three concerns to the extend that I have articulated will only be allowed to impose restrictions if they serve the most evil and survive strict scrutiny from this Court, and indeed serve that substantial evil in the least restrictive manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.699" offset="11112430">Now, with respect to corruption, the Court, as I have indicated, has implicated... has said, has held loudly, that contributions do give rise to that propensity because the candidate my repay out of the public trust, but independent expenditures do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.696" offset="11192469">Now, if this Court were to recognize another purpose to be served, a compelling purpose that will allow quantitative restrictions on speech... that is what this is, a quantitative restriction on speech by a quantitative restriction on money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.978" offset="11289645">If this Court were to find that the requirement of keeping business money out of elections were, despite the previous holdings of this Court, a compelling purpose, it can be served by statutes less restrictive than this, because this statute prohibits Mass Citizens for Life from spending $9800 here to distribute voting records of 492 candidates by means of a newsletter, although they never had any business money in their till and they never made a contribution to any candidate or a coodinated expenditure in their whole existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.186" offset="11446380">A statute could be articulated that would try to keep out business money by disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.709" offset="11476473">If you want to make an independent expenditure, Mr. Charitable Corporation, tell us all your business money and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.077" offset="11497997">Lesser restrictive, but still intrusive, methods could be devised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.315" offset="11514925">But these blanket prohibitions that prohibit the independent expenditure of this organization that never had any business money cannot be justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.604" offset="11552123">Now, the disclosure that the FEC says is to be served here justifies this intrusion into the heart of the First Amendment on the grounds of disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.030" offset="11613772">I'll say three things on that:</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.215" offset="11626520">One, Section 441(b) is not a disclosure statute; two, there is disclosure already required in the statutes; three, further disclosure more burdensome and intrusive is not warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.106" offset="11670092">First, Section 441(b) as interpreted by the FEC is not a disclosure statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.094" offset="11698095">It is an absolute prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.212" offset="11706559">It must rise or fall depending upon whether an absolute prohibition is warranted under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.484" offset="11735607">Section 441(b) does not say: You corporations spend what you want, only disclose what you're about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.805" offset="11764864">Section 441(b) says: You people have chosen a tainted form in which to conduct your activities; the assets that you accumulate from your day to day activities are poison; they must be walled off from the political process, even in the form of independent expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.135" offset="11842187">Section 441(b) says, as the FEC points out: If you wish to set up a committee, and if that committee then solicits special contributions from your members, not from people who may be sympathetically inclined but from people whose names appear in your card index, then you may use that money for independent expenditures, but you may not use your corporate till do pay for your message, your political message, no matter how modest the amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.725" offset="11984606">This cannot be squared with freedom of association.</text>

            <text syncTime="3038.475" offset="12295568">It was very loose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.242" offset="12298598">It has been tightened up since the FEC brought this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.444" offset="12311451">But I want to make the point on disclosure that anyone who makes any independent expenditure for $250 or more must disclose it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.818" offset="12352933">That purposes is already served.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.335" offset="12358993">If this organization were allowed to make such independent expenditures, they would have to reveal that they make the expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.857" offset="12393057">But the purpose of keeping business money out of the electoral process is not served by this statute because of its underinclusive impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.850" offset="12449064">A business organization, a partnership, an association, limited partnerships, a joint venture, need not have any limit on the amount of money that it can spend independently, no limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.277" offset="12506742">True, it must disclose if it spends more than $250.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.079" offset="12521997">And if any contribution in furtherance of an independent expenditure is received, that must be disclosed, as must anyone who makes a disclosure making an independent expenditure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.886" offset="12569227">But these entities that are out in the business world making literally millions and millions and millions of dollars from commerce may spend in an unlimited amount, as long as the major purpose does not become the election of candidates, in which case they transform themselves into a political committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.229" offset="12634637">So there is no purpose to be served by allowing an organization making $30 million a year to spend unlimited amounts and not allowing an ideological incorporated organization from spending anything, if your purpose is to keep business money out of the electoral processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.111" offset="12726171">One further statutory point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.963" offset="12737560">There is an exemption under the general definition of expenditure for newspapers and periodical publications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.700" offset="12768489">Those terms are not defined in the statute or in the regs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.919" offset="12781341">I think that this Court should conclude that Congress did not mean to squelch a publication like this when it granted that exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.244" offset="12830660">It would be a non-constitutional way to affirm the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.732" offset="12852603">In conclusion on this matter, when one considers all the election law cases that this Court has had in the last 40 years... UAW, CIO, the Pipefitters in the seventies, NCPAC, National Right to Work... this case involving a $9800 expenditure to publish a newsletter containing 492 candidates' positions, $20 apiece, constitutes the most insignificant, the most puny threat of any case that has come before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.203" offset="12982484">But when you consider the fundamental principles that bind us together... freedom of association, that ability of individual of like minds to gather together and enhance their weak, faint voices; freedom of the press; freedom of speech... this perhaps is the most significant of all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.813" offset="13052910">The idea that even now, in the last two decades of the twentieth century, an organization like Mass Citizens must stand before this bar and justify having produced a newsletter containing voting records is appalling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.258" offset="13118739">The basic problem with the FEC's case is it was brought 200 years too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.079" offset="13142040">Thank you.</text>
