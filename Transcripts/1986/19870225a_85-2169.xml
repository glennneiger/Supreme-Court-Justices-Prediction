            <text syncTime="74.028" offset="438314">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case involves issues similar to that present in the prior discussion, and started by the filing of three complaints in the Western District of Pennsylvania by plaintiff Dr. Al-Khazraji charging various offenses under the civil rights laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.010" offset="570284">I go into the detail only because there is some question as to what the pleadings here actually raise, and therefore you have the question as to the kind of charges that were in fact made.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.501" offset="632247">My brief sets forth the allegations in the various complaints here, and I would note that the operative complaint as viewed by the District Court did not charge any racial discrimination but charged discrimination on the basis of national origin and religion, and that therefore the question then becomes whether or not an Arab under the facts here would be treated as falling within the scope of section 1981 of Title 42 in a situation when in fact there was not a racial allegation made.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.255" offset="839241">Now, I should say in all fairness that District Judge Zigler who had handled the case before it was reassigned to Judge Menser had read the case or had read the various pleadings more broadly than Judge Menser did and more broadly apparently... and as broadly apparently as the Third Circuit did in this particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.338" offset="923564">But the fact remains that the operative complaint as I think it was read by both Judge Zigler and Judge Menser was really the second complaint, the one filed by prior counsel for the plaintiff here, and that complaint basically restricted itself to a national origin and a religion complaint, not a racial one.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.987" offset="1042160">However, the issue here seems to be premised on the notion that in fact a racial complaint at least could arguably be read into the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.985" offset="1090225">That seems to be the basis upon which the Court granted certiorari in this case, and therefore other than mentioning the limitations on the actual pleadings, which is a fact that the Court might take into consideration, I will then deal with the argument as to whether or not Arabs do fall within the scope of Section 1981 of the--</text>

            <text syncTime="328.948" offset="1458030">My position is really a rather simple one in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.465" offset="1488123">The statute basically talks in terms of white citizens and it seems fairly well admitted by the plaintiff himself in the deposition that he gave that he qualifies as a Caucasian, i.e., that he is in fact racially white.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.627" offset="1572759">The charges of discrimination are presumably that he was discriminated against in relation to other people who are racially white, and our position very simply is that in that kind of a factual situation a claim under Section 1981 is not made.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.158" offset="1642872">And it really comes down to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.521" offset="1652276">He has admitted in the deposition that he does qualify as a Caucasian, i.e., a person who is racially white.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.874" offset="1677772">The statute has been construed by this Court to apply on a racial basis, not on a national origin basis, not on a religion basis, not on a sex basis, and therefore once the plaintiff in essence admits that he is a Caucasian, and when his purported complaint is that he was discriminated against in denial of tenure in relation to other Caucasians, that a claim is not made under the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="704.758" offset="2961324">Because otherwise we start getting into the situation that we then start looking for 1981 purposes at the individual shades of the purported plaintiffs and then starting deciding what degree of darkness or lightness, depending on a particular situation, we are going to say is sufficiently distinctive so that we are going to get involved in saying that we are making out a Section 1981 claim because the purported favored group is dark and the purported aggrieved group is light or vice versa.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.531" offset="3104371">And I would suggest that the characterization in the statute, because of the use of the term white does not include ethnic groups even though there were some discussions during the legislative history and even though the dictionary definitions indicate that the term race may have had some meaning beyond or was used in other than the racial sense in which we use it today.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.608" offset="3216697">The fact is that the statute was not written that way, and I would submit that if Congress had in mind the notion that all these various ethnic groups were to be covered, there would be some... much broader language could have been used than was used in the actual statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.382" offset="3291721">I mean, actually, the interesting thing is, if you look at the legislative history, when they start talking about the different kind of ethnic groups and they are described as race, it so often comes up in the question of they are really talking about the legislatures having power to discriminate by saying the Germans, for example, are not allowed to own property and things of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.976" offset="3394121">In some ways we go back to the earlier discussions that the Court had as to whether the statute in fact covers private claims of action, and the decisions of the Court have determined, of course, that it does, so we have to operate on that premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.039" offset="3458382">And you also run into the generalized disagreement that the Court has had over the years whether the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the reenactment in 1870 were in fact designed to deal solely with the freed slaves and the people in the south rather than the broadened scope that has since been given so that it now apparently covers discrimination against whites, at least vis-a-vis people of other races.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.139" offset="3590771">But those decisions have been reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.833" offset="3601533">Unless the Court is prepared to find exceptions to those or overrule those earlier lines of cases, we have to face the fact that this Court has already decided that the scope of the statute goes beyond the mere protection of blacks which was one of the earlier positions that was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.476" offset="3700172">But in light of the history, I would suggest that it would be inappropriate for the Court to go beyond the broad categorizations and extend the reach of the statue to in essence start covering ethnic groups or nationality groups or nation origin groups, which is the suggestion that is being made here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1365.972" offset="5606170">My suggestion is that it really should be done on a national basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.575" offset="5620590">If you do it on a circuit by circuit basis, then I would suggest that as of the time of the accrual of the cause of action here for the reasons basically set forth in the brief when I discussed the Davis case and the way the Pennypacker case had been decided previously, that it was nowhere clear that a six-year statute of limitations rather than a shorter statute of limitations was going to be... was going to be applied, that those cases if you read them carefully simply were not clearcut enough so that one could say that in all 1981 cases regardless of which of the particular subdivisions of 1981 was going to be applied and regardless of the type of case involved, that there was going to be a six-year statute applied rather than a two-year statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.751" offset="5841272">Therefore without getting into the convenience factor and the notion that full retroactivity here gives a much greater degree of certainty than attempting to go through the procedure that has been happening since Wilson versus Garcia came down with this myriad of cases in the circuits trying to decide how much certainty was there and how much certainty was there not, that the certainty aspect would in fact be enhanced by a determination that full retroactivity is appropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2984.398" offset="12079835">Of course, it could be that there is racial retaliation or religious, violent religious conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.263" offset="12123303">That could be, but that wouldn't be covered by 1982.</text>

            <label>Ms. Caroline Mitchell</label>
            <text syncTime="2997.857" offset="12133647">Well, it would be covered by 1981 or 1982 if the belief was an ancestral belief that Arabs are terrorists or that Jews are inferior.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.611" offset="12168652">It is not directed at them because of their Moslem faith or their Jewish faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.915" offset="12185892">It is directed at them because of what society perceives to be a difference between their culture and the cultures of other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.071" offset="12222568">I would like to address one question that Justice Stevens raised in the Shaare Tefila argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.837" offset="12249631">You asked, did the people who passed 1982 think Jews were a separate race.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.569" offset="12268544">Our answer to the questions is yes, they did believe that Jews and Swedes and Irish and Germans were a separate race, and we advocate here today that the 1866 Act was intended to cover that perception, that ancestral use of the term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.679" offset="12328939">With the Court's permission, I would like to move to the Chevron aspect of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.950" offset="12346075">My argument there is, first of all, that the Third Circuit was correct in holding that under Chevron considerations, the claim under 1981 was timely filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.577" offset="12384527">I will call to the Court's attention one fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.098" offset="12394663">The author of the decision in the Third Circuit, Judge Stapleton, was also the author of a 1977 case, Davis, which was the case relied upon by litigants to believe that there was a six-year statute in the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.868" offset="12453700">We believe that Judge Stapleton correctly interprets the law of the circuit in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.072" offset="12478568">Should, however, this Court find that it would be appropriate to apply a two-year statute of limitations to 1981 under Wilson, we ask that this Court, remand our case to the district for consideration of the equitable estoppel arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.872" offset="12537710">These arguments were raised both before the District Court and before the Circuit, but need not have been reached by either of those courts in reaching their determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.449" offset="12576057">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3116.042" offset="12606359">If the Court please, I am just going to take about 30 seconds only to reply to the last matter on the remand, and may I suggest that if the court looks at the chronology of events the discharge of the plaintiff was in May of 1979, well before the statute of limitations... the two-year Pennsylvania statute of limitations would have run if that one is the... if the Court treats it as retroactive, and therefore anything that anybody may have said to the plaintiff about not doing anything and going through internal processes would not really have made any difference, because he still had plenty of time to file within the two-year period, so there is no basis for equitable estoppel in this situation, even if you believe the allegations in his affidavit that certain statements were made.</text>
