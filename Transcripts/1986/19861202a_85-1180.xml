            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="149468">We will hear arguments first this morning in No. 85-1180, Edwin Meese, Attorney General of the United States, versus Barry Keene.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.706" offset="188234">Mr. Ayer, you may begin whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald B. Ayer</label>
            <text syncTime="11.772" offset="196488">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.057" offset="209654">The issue in this case is the power of federal courts to edit an act of Congress at the behest of one who is not directly restricted or obligated under the statute, but who rather quarrels with the indirect impact of the particular words that Congress has chosen.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.899" offset="269004">The Appellee is a California state senator who brought suit in 1983 to enjoin the application of the Foreign Agents Registration Act to three films distributed by the National Film Board of Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.874" offset="316861">He said that he was deterred from showing publicly those films by the Act's use of the term "political propaganda" to apply to the material as to which the Act imposes labeling and reporting requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.182" offset="366180">The Foreign Agents Registration Act as enacted in 1938 and amended several times since then sets up a scheme of registration and reporting by agents of foreign principals.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.322" offset="414663">The agents under the Act are required to first register and provide information concerning themselves and concerning their foreign principals, also to provide information in separate reports about the dissemination of political advocacy material, which is referred to under the statute by the term "political propaganda".</text>
            <text syncTime="84.701" offset="488224">Finally, the agents are required to label any such political propaganda or foreign political advocacy material as defined in the statute with a label setting forth certain information, including their identities and the identities of their procedure principals and a number of other matters as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.663" offset="560113">The label itself which is required to be attached to the material does not use the words "political propaganda".</text>
            <text syncTime="108.666" offset="584041">The district court in this case noted in its rather lengthy opinion that the definition of "political propaganda" as set forth in the statute is in fact neutral and in no way carries negative connotations.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.695" offset="656244">Notwithstanding that and notwithstanding the fact that this statute by its direct requirements and restrictions in no way touches upon this defendant, who is not a foreign agent, who is not an agent of a foreign principal, who is not a foreign principal, and who is not required to file any report under the statute, and indeed is not even barred from removing or omitting to show a label attached to any material which he does have which comes within the statute, the district court nonetheless found:</text>
            <text syncTime="159.016" offset="785497">First, that the Appellee had standing, on the ground that he was a person whose reputation would be impaired by association with material that had been classified as political propaganda;--</text>
            <text syncTime="173.192" offset="842235">And secondly, on the merits of the case, found that the negative impact on the reputation of anyone associated with the material was such as to amount to a First Amendment violation; and indeed, went on to say that Congress in enacting the statute deliberately set forth to suppress speech, that is the category of speech covered by the terms "political propaganda".</text>
            <text syncTime="195.957" offset="933246">And on that basis the district court enjoined the enforcement of four sections of the statute which apply with reference to political propaganda.</text>

            <text syncTime="229.794" offset="1068560">"copies of political propaganda required by this subchapter to be filed with the Attorney General shall be available for public inspection. "</text>
            <text syncTime="236.448" offset="1095205">the district court enjoined the enforcement of that part of the statute?</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald B. Ayer</label>
            <text syncTime="239.983" offset="1109311">I believe that's Section (c), Your Honor, and that is correct, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.285" offset="1122581">We think that the character of the challenge which was brought here... that is, a challenge to terminology rather than a challenge to the substantive requirements of the statute... is very important to both the standing and merits issues that are presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.313" offset="1186634">Because it is that sort of narrow challenge to the precise use of words by Congress, any analysis both for standing purposes and for merits purposes must go forward with the idea in mind that the substantive scheme, leaving aside the words "political propaganda", is itself valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.942" offset="1261135">It has not been challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.008" offset="1265419">It has not been challenged here and it's not been questioned seriously before.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.477" offset="1279316">So that in determining what effect the words have, the words "political propaganda", we must keep in mind that we have in effect a registration requirement for foreign agents, an updating requirement as to that registration requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.920" offset="1337099">A great deal of material is required by those requirements: The singling out of political advocacy material by whatever definition or set of words one wants to describe it, nonetheless the same mechanism is in place by different words, if not by the words 4 of our brief and the filing of dissemination reports with regard to the material that is defined as political propaganda, or by whatever term you would use.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.827" offset="1472727">So that what is at issue here is not the power of the Congress or the Government to in the abstract single out certain material and simply refer to it by the words "political propaganda".</text>
            <text syncTime="343.050" offset="1521628">It is rather whether Congress can use the words "political propaganda" as an internal legislative classification device, defined in the statute in a non-pejorative way consistent with at least one meaning, one common usage meaning of the word "propaganda", and in a statute whose clear purpose is to disclose and to require disclosure of information, rather than to suppress or in any way restrict the flow of material.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.702" offset="1628208">We think the narrow character of that challenge is relevant, first of all, on the question of standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.689" offset="1656211">Just as the Appellee here had no standing, I think, clearly to challenge the substantive provisions of the statute, because he is not affected by them in any way, we think that he had no standing to nitpick about the particular terminology that Congress chose to use.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="392.983" offset="1721308">Mr. Ayer, in that regard I guess Senator Keene submitted uncontroverted affidavits that exhibiting the films would harm his re-election efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.660" offset="1780031">Could that give him sufficient injury to give him standing, do you think?</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald B. Ayer</label>
            <text syncTime="417.016" offset="1817439">Well, when one looks at the declarations that were filed in this case, declarations in particular by Mr. Bistrin and Mr. Freed and Mr. Peterson, at least two of those, Bistrin and Peterson, deal with the re-election campaign problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.291" offset="1882536">I think what one sees is a primary concern with resentments in the district toward foreign influences, particularly foreign competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.797" offset="1920570">There's discussion about a high unemployment rate, people are anxious and concerned about anybody who would be involved with--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="451.670" offset="1956097">Well, he submitted affidavits showing third party resentment or consequences to him if he exhibited the films, isn't that right?</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald B. Ayer</label>
            <text syncTime="461.711" offset="1996221">--Well, I think in a sense yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.580" offset="2007715">But what is important is that those consequences must be measured.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.365" offset="2026836">What you must be measuring, since the challenge is only to the words "political propaganda", we must be looking at how the words "political propaganda" make more severe or distinct or aggravate a harm which I think is clearly implicit to some degree in the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.160" offset="2094023">We're talking about a statute that registers and discloses information about foreign... dissemination of foreign information.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.080" offset="2121713">And what we're having to analyze here for standing purposes is the incremental harm, if any, that results within that statute from the particular selection of the words "political propaganda".</text>
            <text syncTime="504.472" offset="2167270">And my point in looking at these affidavits is that the resentments to foreign competition, the anxiety or concern that would be expressed by the people on what they describe as large naval and military bases within the district toward foreign sources, those kinds of concerns are not alleviated significantly by changing the words "political propaganda" to something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.355" offset="2270820">Taking the conventional approach of analyzing standing in terms of the--</text>

            <text syncTime="542.330" offset="2318781">May I ask one other question on standing, Mr. Ayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.299" offset="2330588">Does he allege at any time that the statute adversely affects the number of people who will see the films that he wants to exhibit?</text>

            <text syncTime="556.253" offset="2374474">In fact, I think in, I think it's footnote 14 of their brief, they specifically indicate that they do not make that allegation.</text>

            <text syncTime="604.317" offset="2566735">Certainly as the case ended up before the district court at the cross-motions for summary judgment, it is completely clear from both the words of the Appellee's attorney and from the words of the district court that the only issue is the use of the words "political propaganda".</text>
            <text syncTime="620.843" offset="2632772">Now, we don't think, therefore, that... for the reasons that I gave in answer to Justice O'Connor, we don't think that a distinct and palpable injury can be said to be fairly traceable to the words, as distinct from the requirements of the statute.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald B. Ayer</label>
            <text syncTime="656.000" offset="2773416">Well, I think at one point in the case an effort was made to complain about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.254" offset="2794418">The district court found at the initial preliminary injunction hearing that there was no standing to complain about the label.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.593" offset="2823780">I think that's at pages 54 and 55 of the joint appendix... I'm sorry, of the appendix to the jurisdictional statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.281" offset="2858575">But more importantly... well, I suppose not more importantly, but in addition to that, it is clear also from the district court and from the law that there is no requirement of showing the label; that when he shows the film he may physically remove the label, if indeed it's on the film, or he may advance the film to the point where the label isn't visible.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.760" offset="2932449">We think that, for the same reasons that there is no distinct and palpable injury fairly traceable to the words "political propaganda", the removal of those words or the substitution of other words for those words would not remedy the injury that's alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.656" offset="3012070">The films would still possess the same label.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.942" offset="3025236">The Appellee would still be associated with foreign source political advocacy material.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.429" offset="3047179">And most of the problems that are cited in the affidavits would still exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.964" offset="3065256">Now, there is the remaining factor of the affidavits of Mr. Newman and Mr. Doob, which relate to the actual connotations of the words "political propaganda".</text>
            <text syncTime="739.772" offset="3108515">And a couple of, I think, points need to be made from the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.093" offset="3129830">One is that the words themselves are defined in the statute in a neutral way, and so we have to assume that people are going to learn about the words, which do not appear on the label, but not learn about how they're defined in the statute and not try to find out, and jump to the conclusion based on common connotations which people do sometimes draw from those words that the material is somehow to be viewed in a negative way and, furthermore, that people associated with it, who show it, giving whatever introduction they may want to give, that they too suffer from whatever the negative connotations are of the material.</text>

            <text syncTime="793.424" offset="3323137">Well, I think in Lamont that the main distinction that was drawn by the Court was the requirement of some affirmative action, which I take to mean something more than private affirmative action like snipping the label off of a film.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.016" offset="3389488">The affirmative action required was the actual request to the post office to deliver what had been described under the statute as "communist political propaganda".</text>

            <text syncTime="858.532" offset="3583525">But I think that the outcome would be the same, primarily because the Congress ought to be free, within some fairly wide parameters, to define its terminology and use it in a way that it desires to.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.507" offset="3631486">And I think the important point here is that Congress has not made up a definition that's completely unrelated to the word.</text>

            <text syncTime="1176.013" offset="4853494">But I do think you would have to look at precisely how the term is being characterized to determine whether that kind of a cognizable interest is involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1385.900" offset="5692965">On the merits of the case, we think first of all that the merits can be resolved without deciding the extent of the First Amendment protection of Government speech as speech, that is Government simply speaking and stating its view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.943" offset="5749181">We think the issue here is simply whether Congress in carrying out on unchallenged legislative scheme, which is what we have, may for internal classification purposes only utilize terminology which it defines in a clear and non-derogatory way consistent with one of several accepted common meanings of those words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.606" offset="5831832">Or on the other side, taking the other view, Congress can be barred from doing that because some terms that it uses and defines neutrally may be misunderstood as having negative connotations, which in everyday usage at times at least it may have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.116" offset="5897870">We think this falls plainly on the permissible side of the First Amendment line, first of all because it is, in terms of sorting different kinds of speech, it is viewpoint neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.173" offset="5942069">Now, I wouldn't say and I wouldn't allege that it is applied completely without regard to any reference to content.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.010" offset="5969445">It applies with regard to a certain category of speech, like the contribution reporting requirements in Buckley versus Valeo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.433" offset="5999120">It applies to the category of foreign source political advocacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.385" offset="6018973">And we think, given the interest that Congress had in mind when they adopted the statute, that that certainly is a suitable categorization to rely on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.209" offset="6062232">We think it's particularly important on the merits to look to the minimal nature of the harm that we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.381" offset="6094937">And again, it's the incremental harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.081" offset="6101729">It's the harm from the words "political propaganda" over and above whatever effect on reputation results from the statute, which is unchallenged, because the only challenge here is to the words "political propaganda".</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.391" offset="6158990">We're not litigating the underlying statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.510" offset="6167453">The closest cases I think that the Appellees have come up with are the compelled disclosure of affiliation cases, NAACP versus Alabama and that line of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.651" offset="6216041">And there are several distinctions to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.770" offset="6228475">I think one is that there is no affirmative disclosure required here at all, as there is in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.189" offset="6250209">Another is that I think the governmental interest here is more substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.458" offset="6267241">And finally, even if you accept that those cases apply and you apply the test which was invoked in those cases for creating an exception to the disclosure requirement, the test is whether they have made a reasonable showing of likely threats, harassment, or reprisals, and I think it's clear that no such showing has been made here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1622.003" offset="6637448">This case is about a regulatory scheme that so denigrates the material within its scope that it imperils the good name and standing within the community of those who associate themselves with it by its use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.049" offset="6705576">It classifies speech as the political propaganda of a foreign power on the basis of no more substantial determination of what that speech contains than that it does contain political material that either is intended to influence the foreign policies of the United States or may reasonably be adapted to be so used, without referring to whether or not that reasonably adaptation should be seen to be on the part of the foreign agent or the foreign government, but in fact if any material spoken, produced, and disseminated by any registered foreign agent, without regard to their interests or furthering their foreign policy interests or domestic policy interests or trying to influence anybody here in this country, but simply is the result of a nonprofit educational association producing material of high quality journalistic standards for dissemination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.753" offset="6948410">If that kind of material is produced without any intent to influence the American public, if somebody in this country who wishes to receive that material may so reasonably adapt that material to influence this country's public policies, persons connected with those public policies, then that material too may be classified as political propaganda under the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1881.016" offset="7673465">And that would be that with regard to the label, particularly in respect to Mr. Justice White's question, that is not a neutral label and we've never conceded that it was.</text>

            <text syncTime="1948.558" offset="7943675">We have, however, come to this Court under Elum-Yaretsky with all the arguments we can bring to bear with respect to the unconstitutionality of this particular statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.366" offset="7986830">One of those arguments is that appending this particular source identification label is not just simply source disclosure, which we don't complain of.</text>

            <text syncTime="1984.584" offset="8087767">What we do complain of is that that label is a red flag.</text>

            <text syncTime="1997.141" offset="8138026">It goes on with regard to statutory language that is to the ordinary viewer intimidating and ends with the statement, after saying that this material is being distributed by a registered foreign agent and all of these records are on file with the Department of Justice, public records, anybody can go look at them, as if ordinarily we examine speakers that way or the government requires speakers to be on record that way, but it ends by saying that the government, by allowing the film to be shown or the material to be distributed, does not approve the contents therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.642" offset="8252025">We do not have a system whereby the government ordinarily stands astride the stream of commerce in the marketplace of ideas, in the stream of ideas in speech and debate, and assumes the power to approve or disapprove speech, foreign or domestic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.186" offset="8322137">If this particular label were required to be affixed to material produced here by domestic speakers and classified on the same basis, that it spoke to the foreign policies of this nation, I don't think this Court would find it to be constitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="2437.939" offset="9901187">But the Film Board through its policies and practices may wish to do so, and distribute the material into this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.743" offset="9924384">And at that point that material, because it mentions a foreign policy of the United States and could, not intended to but could reasonably be adapted to by someone in this country affect those foreign policies, now is going to be designated as political propaganda and, further, must have affixed to it this red flag of a warning label that the government doesn't approve the contents of this material.</text>

            <text syncTime="3379.471" offset="13667313">Thank you, Mr. Donhoff.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald B. Ayer</label>
            <text syncTime="3384.006" offset="13685390">Mr. Donhoff indicated that it would be a mistake to determine these issues piece by piece in this instance by singling out the words "political propaganda" and taking them in isolation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.350" offset="13742859">I would like to agree with that and go a step further with the standing argument which I made earlier, focusing on the injury, the palpable injury, and the redressability of the injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.490" offset="13787372">And I'd like to suggest that perhaps this case is much like other cases that this Court has decided, where it has found no justiciable claim to exist, where the claim is of incidental effects, but there is no direct regulation, proscription, compulsion, or any other kind of direct adverse treatment involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.523" offset="13879532">Allen versus Wright and Laird v. Tatum I think are to such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.241" offset="13898340">And the reason I suggest that is I think that's the only way that one is going to avoid the kind of piecemeal litigation that Mr. Donhoff agrees ought to be avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.449" offset="13939195">If we're going to let people come in and pick at words because they are arguably affected in some remote and incidental way, we're going to end up with litigation focusing on pieces of statutes, rather than going to the main crux of what someone is arguing about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.625" offset="13999904">I think that's particularly important here, where the issue is whether Congress can choose words and indeed also, because this is a case involving foreign policy, where I think if any case is proper to Congress' choice of words and Congress' judgment this is one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.552" offset="14063643">Thank you very much.</text>
