            <text syncTime="12.224" offset="200310">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is a Federal Civil Rights action for damages under 42 USC Section 1983 brought by respondent Ortega against petitioners herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.115" offset="247957">The suit seeks $250,000 in compensatory damages and $500,000 in punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.685" offset="274184">When this case arose in 1981, petitioners were hospital administrators at Napa State Hospital in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.689" offset="302187">Respondent was a full-time state employed psychiatrist who was chief of professional education at that institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.362" offset="332907">He had training and supervision responsibilities over all psychiatric residents of the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.099" offset="355895">In the course of an administrative investigation into charges of work-related wrongdoing on his part, two of the petitioners authorized the entry of respondent's government-assigned office and an inventory of its contents.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.322" offset="408767">Thereafter this suit was filed in United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that the activity constituted an unreasonable search and seizure in violation of respondent's Fourth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.333" offset="460803">Cross-motions for summary judgment were filed by all parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.535" offset="477626">The District Court ruled in favor of petitioners, holding the activity did not constitute an unreasonable search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.558" offset="513675">The District Court concluded that there was a public necessity to secure the office, that the search was efficacious, and that the degree of intrusion was minimal.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.616" offset="553903">Respondent appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals thereafter, which reversed the judgment of the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.935" offset="579190">The Ninth Circuit held that respondent had a subjective expectation of privacy which society was prepared to recognize as reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.923" offset="611164">The matter was thereafter remanded on the issue of damages only.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.243" offset="628404">This Court granted petitioner's petition for writ of certiorari on the single issue--</text>

            <text syncTime="152.112" offset="759957">Mr. Friday, who is the hospital administrator, testified that shortly after the entry and inventory was made he went in himself to see how the progress was going.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.253" offset="808440">In the process he saw boxes of materials, personal items boxed and on the floor at that point, and he indicated that he opened up the right file drawer.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.061" offset="847729">In the record itself it doesn't say whether it was a file drawer to a desk or to a filing cabinet, for the purpose of securing residents' files.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.017" offset="887539">In fact, there were residents' files there, and in addition to that there may have been other state material there.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.272" offset="924529">The secretary to Dr. Ortega, Ms. Sirallo, testified or gave a declaration to the effect that the respondent often took residents' files into his office--</text>

            <text syncTime="1788.107" offset="7303840">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, our argument rests on three propositions: first, that it is both customary and reasonable for a public employee to keep personal papers and effects in his work office and to expect that the privacy of such materials will be protected against arbitrary searches or seizures by his employer; second, that the application of the Fourth Amendment to office searches is not incompatible with the government's responsibilities as an employer.</text>
