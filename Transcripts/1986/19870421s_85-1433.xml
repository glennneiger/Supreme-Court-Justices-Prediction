            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="91772">Richardson versus Marsh which comes to us from the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit also involves a Bruton issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.119" offset="124164">Specifically the question is whether Bruton applies when the non testifying codefendant's confession has been redacted to omit with all reference to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.528" offset="161780">But the defendant is nonetheless linked to the confession by evidence properly admitted later in the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.869" offset="191246">Respondent Clarissa Marsh was tried jointly with Benjamin Williams for murder and robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.290" offset="212876">At their trial Williams confession was admitted over respondent's objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.377" offset="237222">That confession had been redacted to omit all reference to respondent indeed to omit all indication that anyone other than Williams and the third accomplice named Martin had participated in the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.534" offset="285810">In his confession, Williams described the conversion he had had with Martin as they drove to the victims' home, during which Martin said that he would have kill the victims after robbing them.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.803" offset="326979">The jury was admonished at the trial not to use Williams' confession in any way against the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.452" offset="353519">Williams did not testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.788" offset="362923">In her testimony however, respondent admitted being in the car, with Williams and Martin but claimed that she had not heard their conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.291" offset="396882">Respondent insisted that she did not realize that the victims were to be robbed and killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.997" offset="415690">Respondent was convicted in her conviction was affirmed by the State Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.487" offset="429692">Petition for the writ of habeas corpus was denied by the Federal District Court, but the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed holding that respondent was entitled to a new trial under Bruton.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.495" offset="469712">In our opinion filed today, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.231" offset="488624">We hold that the Confrontation Clause is not violated by the admission of a non testifying codefendant's confession with a proper limiting instruction when, as here, the confession is redacted to eliminate all reference to the defendant's existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.868" offset="543168">There are two important distinctions between this case and Bruton which cause it to fall outside of the narrow exception Bruton recognized, to the almost invariable assumption that jurors follow their instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.426" offset="585382">First where a confession is not incriminating on its face as was  the confession in Bruton but becomes incriminating only when linked with evidence introduced later at the trial, it is easier for the jurors to follow their instructions to disregard it.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.063" offset="635955">Second if limited to facially incriminating confessions, Bruton can be complied with through the simple process of redaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.344" offset="665108">When extended to confessions that only become incriminating by reason of evidence introduced later in the trial, application of the Bruton exception becomes inordinately disruptive of the criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.142" offset="712337">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion which is joined by Justices Brennan and Marshall.</text>
