            <text syncTime="19.378" offset="218470">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this appeal brings before the Court two taxes, the axle tax and the marker fee which are imposed by the State of Pennsylvania on trucks that travel over its highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.006" offset="289001">Appellants challenge both of these taxes under the commerce clause as discriminatory against truckers who engage in interstate operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.779" offset="324109">I should make clear at the outset that we do not question the amount of revenues that Pennsylvania seeks to raise by these taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.218" offset="353889">We strongly support the right of every state to raise the funds which it needs to keep its highways safe and unobstructed.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.972" offset="380847">Our objection to these taxes goes only to their discriminatory character and to the penalty which they impose on those who choose to participate in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.577" offset="423270">I would like to begin today with a discussion of our flat tax challenge which relates to both the marker fee and the axle tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.416" offset="454617">The marker fee charged a flat sum of $25 per truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.654" offset="471649">The axle tax charges $36 per axle.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.272" offset="486068">That is $180 for almost every truck that travels in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.510" offset="507071">Under the axle tax a truck that travels a few thousand miles in Pennsylvania pays the same amount as a truck that travels ten, twenty, or fifty times as much.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.116" offset="549494">Truckers from other states who are light users of Pennsylvania's highways end up paying the same amount as local truckers who use the highways on a regular basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.423" offset="590663">The result is a cost per mile that is much higher on the average for the out-of-state trucker than for the in-state trucker, and that, as this Court has pointed out on several occasions, is the inherent discriminatory effect of a flat tax which favors local users and disfavors users from other states whose business requires them to move across the country in interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="226.696" offset="1047805">When a taxpayer moves in interstate commerce from state to state and can only spend a limited amount of time in any particular state, that is where this problem is at its most acute.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.920" offset="1088661">In order to get the full benefit of the flat tax that the local taxpayer gets he'd have to give up the interstate business.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.474" offset="1114888">Inherently he is spending 2 percent or 5 percent of his time in each state around the country, and when he faces a large, unapportioned flat tax in state after state after state, that is what produces the difficulty for the interstate carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.366" offset="1166506">As I have suggested to Justice Scalia, the real problem here is the problem of cumulative burdens which the trucker faces when he passes from state to state and he gets hit by flat taxes again and again.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.625" offset="1215512">We now have these flat taxes in seven different states, and additional states are now considering them.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.993" offset="1236932">This means that the cost of engaging in a multi-state trucking business gets higher and higher the more the taxpayer attempts to participate in our national common market economy.</text>

            <text syncTime="669.819" offset="2820266">We would like to emphasize before turning in greater detail to these flat tax cases that Justice O'Connor has referred to what we believe the governing commerce clause standard is in a case like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.645" offset="2871570">We begin with the Complete Auto Decision, which teaches that judicial review today must focus on the practical economic effect of these statutes and not on the labels which are attached to them, and the Court made clear in Complete Auto that a tax that falls on interstate commerce must be nondiscriminatory in its practical operation and it must be fairly related to the services which are provided by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.111" offset="2965402">Now, in the Nippert case this Court explained the discriminatory practical impact of a flat tax when it invalidated a flat tax that fell on traveling salesmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.949" offset="3004795">The Court explained, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="718.568" offset="3015244">"The very difference between interstate and local trade taken in conjunction with the inherent character of the tax makes equality of application of the tax to these two classes of commerce impossible. "</text>
            <text syncTime="731.309" offset="3066235">The Court emphasized that this discrimination is not just a matter of looking at one single state in isolation, but there are cumulative burdens as these large flat taxes are laid in succession on persons across the country to conduct their business.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.469" offset="3122868">The Court has pointed out in Armco and in other recent cases that the tax must not impose unacceptable discrimination if every state in the United States were to adopt that tax, and we think that the constitutional infirmity here is evident when you project these flat taxes onto a 50-state basis and you ask what would happen if every state had an axle tax and it cost $9,000 to conduct the same business on a multistate basis than it would cost if you confined your operations to a single state.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.255" offset="3241987">Now, in Commonwealth Edison, this Court also explained that under the modern, pragmatic approach to commerce clause issues, a tax won't pass muster unless its measure is fairly related to the services provided by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.665" offset="3299665">The formula for measuring the tax has to be geared to the in-state presence and activity of the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.568" offset="3323280">Now, in this case, it is undisputed that the measure of the tax is not related to the taxpayer's presence or activities in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.340" offset="3354313">The very purpose of this tax is to raise money for highway maintenance and highway upkeep, yet the local trucker who travels 100,000 miles on the highway pays the same thing as an out-of-state trucker who comes in and puts in two or three or four thousand miles on the highway, even though the local trucker may be causing 50 times as much wear on the highway system.</text>

            <text syncTime="867.498" offset="3610940">Now, the Court has said that on many occasions, most recently in the Bacchus case, and these discriminatory effects, I think it is important to point out, have not been overlooked by the other states which now retaliate against flat taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.007" offset="3660991">We have eight states already which retaliate against the axle tax, and in a special report that we have lodged with the Court, the Pennsylvania Legislature has made a study of the effect of that retaliation, and it has found that the retaliation is</text>

            <text syncTime="898.219" offset="3733820">This is the real world interstate impact of the axle tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.420" offset="3746672">It is producing a virtual trade war among the states, and one that is very injurious to interstate trucking activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.524" offset="3775094">Now, despite all these discriminatory effects reliance is placed on the Aero Mayflower line of cases referred to by Justice O'Connor, and I would like to spend a few minutes talking about them because they are quite important.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.982" offset="3820965">The principal rationale in Aero Mayflower was that a flat tax is reasonable because it pays for the "privilege" of highway use.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.738" offset="3855969">The Court reasoned that it wasn't the state's fault if the driver didn't make full use of that privilege after paying for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.142" offset="3881569">This, we say, is the kind of reliance on abstractions rather than dollars and cents effects which Complete Auto has put behind us.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.497" offset="3915005">The privilege rationale ignores the fact that a truck can't be in more than one state at one time.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.401" offset="3938620">So an interstate trucker who is forced to pay a substantial unapportioned flat tax in state after state for a privilege he can use only occasionally in any particular state is placed at a serious competitive disadvantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.911" offset="3992641">The only way to get the full benefit of the privilege, in other words, is to give up the interstate business and become a local operator who can drive 50, 60, or 70,000 miles on the highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.033" offset="4033079">Now, the other point that was relied on in Aero Mayflower was administrative convenience that the Court has referred to in the argument, and I think it is important to bear in mind that almost all of the highway taxes today are raised by nondiscriminatory means.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.609" offset="4091384">The state can simply rely more substantially on existing nondiscriminatory taxes which are already in place.</text>

            <text syncTime="1245.527" offset="5123116">We object to the revenue-raising tax which is laid for the privilege of doing business where the interstate operator gets much less use than the in-state operator for the payment of $180 or $25, but we don't challenge flat taxes categorically, and I think that is an important concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.607" offset="5199394">Now, the last point that was relied on in the Aero Mayflower case was the Court's belief that flat taxes don't create a substantial burden on anybody, and this, as I have been driving at earlier, is simply not a tenable rationale today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.367" offset="5262506">In contrast to the days of Aero Mayflower, the trucking industry today is made up of truckers, many of whom engage in business in all 48 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.556" offset="5295211">These trucks are facing a rising tide of flat taxes across the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.841" offset="5312347">We are talking about smaller companies and we are also talking about larger companies that may have several thousand trucks in their fleet, each of which has to be qualified in every state in the union in order to bring goods from the east coast to the west coast or from the north to the south, and we say that these accumulating burdens are very far from insubstantial or minimal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.422" offset="5394685">These burdens, we say, are also in no sense counterbalanced or justified by the registration fee which Pennsylvania charges to its own truckers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.396" offset="5438571">The argument has been made that a large registration fee is imposed on local truckers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.014" offset="5457066">The fact is that Pennsylvania's registration fee is just at the median in the United States today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.018" offset="5477023">The average was $910 at the beginning of this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.453" offset="5490816">Their fee is $945.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.255" offset="5501996">The range is from $36 up to $2,200 in my home state of Illinois, so there is nothing unusual about their registration fee, and in addition to that it is a nondiscriminatory system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.147" offset="5549539">Everybody gets treated fairly under the registration system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.249" offset="5561974">Everybody gets the benefit of apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.967" offset="5572841">Everybody gets the benefit of reciprocity when they travel over other reciprocity states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.855" offset="5592380">Truckers in each state get the benefit of the nondiscriminatory nationwide registration system, including truckers in the state of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.543" offset="5635116">Now, we submit, in short, that the practical approach to commerce clause issues which has been taken by this Court in its most recent decisions teaches that Aero Mayflower can no longer be invoked to defend flat taxes which impose these cumulative burdens on commerce which fall to satisfy the internal consistency principle when you consider these taxes on a 48-state basis--</text>

            <text syncTime="1461.018" offset="5985053">Now, of course, we have a second commerce clause challenge in this case which relates to the facial or the structural discrimination issue, and that, of course, is focused in solely on the axle tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.028" offset="6037089">The essence of this contention is that this statute discriminated on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.746" offset="6059972">Section 3 of the statute imposed the new tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.198" offset="6069794">Section 1 of the statute granted an offsetting reduction for local business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.001" offset="6089020">We say that this is squarely within the holding of Maryland versus Louisiana, where a general tax was imposed on commerce, offsetting reductions were given to local business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.691" offset="6127786">We are met in defense of the statute with the argument that even though there is no compensatory tax doctrine defense here, that the whole arrangement should be defended and accepted because it constitutes a rational restructuring of tax burdens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.903" offset="6192570">Now, the important thing, I think, to bear in mind about this rational restructuring argument is that there isn't a scintilla of evidence that anyone was engaged in a rational restructuring of tax burdens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.592" offset="6235410">The statute says on its face that its purpose was to rehabilitate bridges and give jobs to local residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.762" offset="6260070">There isn't a single word said about adjusting or rearranging tax burdens to come up with an equitable solution that wouldn't discriminate against interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.570" offset="6299254">The Court is being asked to accept a new doctrine, an unstructured doctrine, this rational readjustment doctrine, with absolutely no basis in the statute or its history to suggest that that was what was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.944" offset="6348782">Now, if the Court please, I would like to rest on our briefs which deal with the facial discrimination issue in greater detail and reserve the balance of our time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1589.669" offset="6499665">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, there are two reasons why Pennsylvania's axle tax is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.627" offset="6547521">First of all, flat user fees have formed a vital part of the tax schemes of all the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.698" offset="6575734">They are easy to administer and fair in their application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.518" offset="6599035">So long as they are reasonably related to the services rendered by the state, they have been considered constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.624" offset="6627456">The constitutionality of these taxes has been upheld for almost 100 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.111" offset="6653474">And the appellants have just pointed out that they do not contest that Pennsylvania's axle tax is excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.765" offset="6684090">The second reason is that the appellants stress the fact that when Pennsylvania enacted its axle tax it reduced registration fees in an equivalent amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.358" offset="6734454">However, what they don't stress is that in 1980 Pennsylvania had raised its registration fees in the same amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.047" offset="6769144">That means the only effect of the 1982 drop in registration fees was to restore Pennsylvania's tax scheme to its status quo before imposing an axle tax on all trucks using Pennsylvania's highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.092" offset="6845317">The appellants request this Court to invalidate flat fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.615" offset="6879485">There is no way to assess a particular user of a user system such as a highway system with his particular portion of the cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.172" offset="6925670">That is because the costs are generated by so many factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.957" offset="6940821">In a highway system it can be generated by weight, by mileage, and by configuration.</text>
