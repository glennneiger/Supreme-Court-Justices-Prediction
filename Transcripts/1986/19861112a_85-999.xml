            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="16.510" offset="205899">The first decree, the first litigated decree in this case in 1972 focused on discrimination in hiring and found that the Alabama state troopers had indeed been engaging in discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.971" offset="271727">Promotions were mentioned only in passing in that decree in general terms forbidding all discrimination in promotions.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.375" offset="301298">In 1975, Judge Johnson appeared to assume that the one for one hiring quota he imposed in '72 and reaffirmed in 1975 would not need to be carried forward to promotions, that it would work itself out.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.301" offset="360961">As he said that time,</text>
            <text syncTime="57.087" offset="368171">"The Court did not order promotional quotas. "</text>
            <text syncTime="59.372" offset="377262">"Rather it set a hiring quota. "</text>
            <text syncTime="62.156" offset="388442">Promotions were only focused on in any decree of the Court in the 1979 consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.810" offset="415087">That consent decree provided, and it was voluntarily entered into by all parties, including the Alabama department and the United States, that promotions to corporal should proceed according to procedures fair to all, racially neutral, with little or no adverse impact on blacks, and in conformity with the 1978 Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selections.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.878" offset="523339">Shortly thereafter the department proposed and all parties agreed that there be a batch of promotions to corporal which batch included four black and six white troopers.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.619" offset="574330">There were no promotions to corporal thereafter until the batch involved in the present proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.058" offset="608080">In 1981, after a certain amount of delay and further prodding by both the United States, the plaintiffs, and the Court, the department did come up with a promotion procedure, including a written exam and the use of factors such as seniority and evaluations.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.824" offset="695120">The plaintiffs, Paradise, and the United States, had concerns that this procedure would in fact have an adverse impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.060" offset="720093">But it was agreed by all that the procedure would go forward, the exam would be administered, and then would look and see what the numbers were.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.916" offset="755515">In the event the numbers were just dreadful and the promotions did not go forward according to that procedure, there would have been no blacks promoted according to the procedure if it had run its course.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.260" offset="812880">Therefore, and here I read from the joint appendix, Page 91, the plaintiffs, respondents here, stated that the department, and I am quoting here,</text>
            <text syncTime="179.382" offset="857288">"in apparent recognition of the adverse impact. "</text>
            <text syncTime="182.751" offset="870767">of the 1981 procedure offered to make the next batch of promotions to corporal in such a way that 20 percent of those promoted would be black troopers.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.410" offset="929490">The plaintiff respondents rejected this offer and began this proceeding to enforce the consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.099" offset="960210">In that proceeding the plaintiffs again offered to make four of the 15 promotions promotions of black candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.007" offset="1003887">That was rejected by the plaintiffs and by the District Court, which instead imposed the one for one hiring quota in question in this case, stating that it would remain in effect not just for that particular batch of promotions, but until the higher ranks of the department reflected the 25 percent goal of the hiring quota or acceptable procedures had been worked out as per the consent decree.</text>

            <text syncTime="255.949" offset="1163652">The next batch of promotions to corporal proceeded on a three black trooper for nine or ten white trooper basis in '84/'85, and to date the promotion procedures have not yet been validated as job related according to the Uniform Guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.379" offset="1245363">There is, in our view, a single issue on certiorari here and that is whether the 1983 one for one promotion quota imposed by the District Court comports with the equal protection guarantees of the Constitution, and we take as our point of departure the law as laid down by this Court in the Sheetmetal Workers case.</text>

            <text syncTime="372.643" offset="1630408">Certainly, there is a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.526" offset="1637931">There is a difference because a hiring quota, as this Court pointed out, has a more diffuse effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.315" offset="1669069">The hiring quota has its burden, and there is a burden, which is why it is troublesome, but nevertheless it has a burden on a whole undifferentiated population of persons applying for a job.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.141" offset="1732390">A promotion quota works on a distinct cohort, people who have worked together, who know each other, and who have embarked on a career with certain expectations, so there is indeed a difference between the two, but we do not have the hiring quota before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.936" offset="1795502">Now, the Sheetmetal Workers case established that, first of all, if there is to be action, state action, and that doesn't matter whether it is legislative, executive, or judicial, which uses a racial classification, there must be a compelling state interest or at least an important state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.366" offset="1885259">Second, this racially preferential means to the end must be shown to have a close fit to the end, and the term that we prefer and that seems to capture the idea is that of narrow tailoring which the Court has used on many occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.895" offset="1955371">And finally, there has to be a most searching inquiry to determine whether this hand in glove relation between means and ends actually obtains.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.286" offset="1996958">The end in view in this case in respect to the action which is before this Court cannot really be disputed because it is designated by the very style of the proceedings out of which the disputed order emerged.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.795" offset="2062996">These were proceedings to enforce the consent decree, and therefore the end in view of the decree was to enforce the 1979, 1981 consent decrees that promotions go forward on procedures fair to all without an adverse impact on black candidates and in conformity with the 1978 Uniform Guidelines, and the only question before this Court is whether the one for one order imposed in 1983 was indeed narrowly tailored to that end.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.919" offset="2207505">Now, narrow tailoring, of course, is a very factual inquiry, and yet it cannot be the case that a court or any other governmental actor can simply run the term "narrow tailoring" up the flagpole and then continue to do whatever it is he wanted to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.132" offset="2280334">It is meant to be a break on ill-considered or unnecessary recourse to race by the courts or by anyone else.</text>

            <text syncTime="1501.776" offset="6146875">Because on this occasion a promotion was ordered by a court on a basis which we consider to be profoundly illegal, and the fact that it happened to a few people only once doesn't change that fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="1567.135" offset="6408308">Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, at the time the one for one promotion requirement was entered in this case three alternative remedies had already failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.478" offset="6461703">The first remedy was imposed in 1970 in a case called United States v. Frazier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.465" offset="6485631">It was a remedy imposed against the Department of Personnel, one of the defendants in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.286" offset="6508932">It was a simple injunction, an injunction that enjoined it from discriminating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.905" offset="6523456">Because the Department of Personnel administers the Alabama merit law, the injunction applied across the board to all Alabama state agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.878" offset="6575283">In 1972 the District Court found that at least as far as the state troopers were concerned the injunction had been ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.853" offset="6615198">In the face of such a blatant violation it ordered, among other things, the one for one hiring requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.357" offset="6649262">The District Court hiring requirement stays into effect or lasts until 25 percent of the trooper force as a whole is black.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.600" offset="6698163">It is not limited to the entry level rank because the judge felt that the defendant's discrimination could not be so neatly characterized as being limited to hiring.</text>

            <text syncTime="1654.276" offset="6756886">You disagree then with the Solicitor General, Mr. Cohen, as to whether the 1972 decree dealt with promotions?</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Richard Cohen</label>
            <text syncTime="1661.897" offset="6787397">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.382" offset="6797324">In 1979, in spite of the fact that the 1972 decree was designed to provide an impetus to promote blacks, not a single black had been promoted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.373" offset="6841314">This time, however, the parties provided a solution, a consent decree that was entered by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.194" offset="6868586">It was a partial decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.879" offset="6875273">It did not disturb the prior orders that had been entered in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.830" offset="6891156">Instead, it provided a mechanism by which blacks could finally advance within the ranks of the Alabama state troopers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.686" offset="6926578">In 1983 the District Court found that the third remedy had failed miserably.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.007" offset="6955835">The Alabama state troopers were still without any acceptable promotion procedures, and according to the District Court it did not appear that they would have any such procedures in the near future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.184" offset="7004527">The Solicitor General writes to this Court that there was no history of recalcitrance by the time 1983 came, that the Department of Public Safety, the Alabama state troopers had made a generous offer of 20 percent in... right prior to the enforcement action beginning in 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.417" offset="7113510">These statements don't stand scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.453" offset="7129601">The 20 percent offer to which the Solicitor referred was not intended to be an offer that recognized that the decree had... that the promotion procedure had an adverse impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.379" offset="7189370">It was designed to instead temporarily postpone the day of reckoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.318" offset="7217059">As a matter of fact, when the plaintiffs brought the point out in the District Court that the 20 percent offer had been made, the defendants objected and said it was a confidential settlement offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.292" offset="7272961">The Solicitor also indicates that the system that was adopted after the consent degree was entered was no different than the system that was in place prior to the adoption of the Court's December 15, 1983, order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.842" offset="7359165">That is false.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.675" offset="7366480">The offer on the table was a one-time proposal, a one time proposal to promote eleven whites and four blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.549" offset="7410052">It was a proposal that was... the numbers were generated, I suppose, as an attempt to modestly comply with the requirement that there be no adverse impact, but the numbers were not generated by any sort of procedure or any sort of selection procedure that was in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.177" offset="7484553">The numbers to which the Solicitor points after the promotion order was entered were numbers that came about through the department's attempt to come up with promotion procedures that complied with its requirements under the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.976" offset="7579743">The department represents that the promotion procedures comply with the decree, and the promotion procedures that they have adopted are far different than the promotion procedures that they had at the time the order was entered.</text>

            <text syncTime="1898.667" offset="7734493">Now, you are contesting that it has to be narrowly tailored.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.655" offset="7750480">You would say one for one is okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.857" offset="7767198">I presume you would also say that all promotions must be of blacks as opposed to whites.</text>

            <text syncTime="1920.700" offset="7822578">I think there would be a significant difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.152" offset="7836370">If all the promotions had gone to blacks, then it would have been the case that white state troopers would have had to perhaps wait an awfully long time in order to have another chance to even compete for promotional opportunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.994" offset="7895825">The District Court's order, on the other hand, leaves white troopers with the opportunity to compete at worst for at least half of the promotional opportunities or the promotion positions available.</text>

            <text syncTime="1980.755" offset="8062800">--I think the District Court had to carefully balance the competing interests at stake, on the one hand the need to enforce the Department's consent decree obligations, and on the other hand the need to minimize any burden imposed on whites.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.931" offset="8123508">The Court chose the one for one requirement for essentially two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.585" offset="8146183">The one for one requirement had existed at the hiring level for quite some time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.056" offset="8168021">The requirement had proven effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.608" offset="8178261">It had also proven to be manageable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.042" offset="8187979">In addition, the District Court looked to this Court's opinion in Webber, an opinion that's... albeit in a different context, to see what type of burden, or to seek guidance on what type of burden could be permissibly imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.136" offset="8244403">The one for one promotion requirement that the District Court did impose also was far better suited to the situation that confronted it for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.610" offset="8294245">First, it compensated the beneficiaries of the department's consent decree commitments for the department's delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.531" offset="8325905">Secondly, it provided a mechanism designed to ensure that the intolerable situation that confronted the District Court would not reoccur.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.953" offset="8359655">If the department... if the department had simply been enjoined to do what it was supposed to do all along, there would be no incentive to end its footdragging.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.344" offset="8401138">Now, the Solicitor does suggest that there were a variety of nonracial alternatives that the District Court could have imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.882" offset="8443352">For example, he mentions contempt or threatening the department with the prospect of taking over its operations through the appointment of an administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.489" offset="8477729">Whether these types of procedures would have served the purpose of the District Court order in ensuring future compliance with the consent decree is a matter, of course, where opinions might differ.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.648" offset="8534362">Nevertheless, two points are clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.850" offset="8543244">The District Court entered its order only after carefully reviewing the failure of prior orders in this case to make the Alabama Department of Public Safety finally promote black troopers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.027" offset="8603952">Secondly, none of the so-called plentiful nonracial alternatives that the Solicitor General puts forward here were ever presented to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.918" offset="8647525">Not a single one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.552" offset="8654003">Now, this Court should not underestimate the ingenuity of litigants to think of new nonracial alternatives after the fact given that the District Court here had a firm basis and a reasoned basis for adopting its race-conscious remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.213" offset="8720668">Sanctioning the Solicitor General's approach here would mean that litigation like this would never come to an end.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.819" offset="8755045">Defendants with an egregious record of discrimination would have incentives to delay, and appellate courts, not having the benefit of the parties before it or familiarity with the record will always be required to second guess District Court judgments.</text>

            <text syncTime="2929.673" offset="11858496">I can't be assured that the promotions will be on a nondiscriminatory basis, and therefore you don't do them until you have a validated plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="2936.227" offset="11884723">Of course, that would require the District Court to decide promotions from where, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.280" offset="11904890">The District Court here did by its 1979 consent decree enjoin promotions to corporal other than the ten made pursuant to the side agreement until such time as the defendant lived up to its obligations under the decree, so an order similar to the one that Your Honor is mentioning was entered in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.313" offset="12001020">The defendant put forward a procedure that would have guaranteed that every promotion go to a white person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.935" offset="12039577">It tried to justify this result by pointing to the results of its unvalidated hiring tests, and so I think the record is clear that there is no reason to believe that the type of order that Your Honor is suggesting would have worked in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.284" offset="12128916">The District Court's order had a limited impact on white troopers in two other important respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.223" offset="12168726">Because the District Court's order only applies in the absence of procedures for determining merit, it cannot be meaningfully said that the one for one requirement disrupts legitimate expectations based on merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.338" offset="12257125">Secondly, although the government has much to say about the role of seniority in promotions in general it does not contest the fact that seniority played a trivial role here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.015" offset="12319819">At bottom the government's claim rests on the argument that persons have a right to be considered for promotion on the basis of merit rather than on the basis of the color of one's skin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.125" offset="12384289">This argument, of course, in the context of this case merely restates the question, because the one for one requirement only applies in the absence of procedures for determining merit, the government's argument is simply a reiteration of that, that the promotion order here, like any race-conscious remedy, draws a distinction on the basis of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.675" offset="12486480">This Court has made it clear that such distinctions can sometimes be drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.179" offset="12516573">It was properly drawn in this case.</text>
