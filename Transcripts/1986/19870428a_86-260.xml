            <text syncTime="81.635" offset="470868">In 1984 Congress enacted 23 USC Section 158.</text>

            <text syncTime="98.330" offset="537637">The Act prohibits or mandates that the Secretary of Transportation shall not distribute 5 percent of a state's highway funds if it is not in compliance for Fiscal Year 1987, and it further mandates that the Secretary will withhold 10 percent of those funds for each and every year thereafter that the state has failed to comply.</text>

            <text syncTime="220.276" offset="1025395">For the past 48 years South Dakota has allowed persons younger than age 21 to consume low point beer, ever since South Dakota has adopted an approach that not only recognizes the social concerns over alcohol but has gradually introduced its young people to alcoholic beverages.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.343" offset="1125705">Twice since 1939 we have raised our minimum drinking age for low point beer from 18 to 19, and since the repeal of state prohibition in 1934 we have required all persons to be at least 21 years old before they would be allowed to consume alcoholic beverages other than low point beer.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.439" offset="1218074">South Dakota has likewise enacted and strictly enforced drinking driver statutes, and over the course of the last few years through the strict enforcement of those statutes we have effectuated a 30 percent reduction in the number of drinking-related fatalities on our highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.587" offset="1298636">In September of 1984 we filed a complaint in District Court, seeking a declaration that Section 158 was unconstitutional and further requesting an injunction prohibiting the Secretary of Transportation from enforcing the provisions of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.215" offset="1369166">The District Court dismissed and the Court of Appeals affirmed on the basis that South Dakota's complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.689" offset="1415037">Just by procedural... or just by a little bit of history, as this Court is aware, in 1933 this nation adopted the Twenty-First Amendment, thereby repealing 16 years of national prohibition and reserving to the states the power of choice as to whether or not to allow the importation of alcoholic beverages within their own states.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.090" offset="1516601">This Court has also recognized that a state has the absolute power to prohibit totally the sale of alcohol within its own borders pursuant to the Twenty-First Amendment, and this Court has equally recognized that a state has broad power under the Twenty-First Amendment to regulate the times, places, and circumstances under which alcohol may be sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.872" offset="1611792">As this Court stated in New York State Liquor Authority versus Balianca,</text>
            <text syncTime="371.491" offset="1630286">"It is equally well recognized that a state has broad power under the Twenty-First Amendment to regulate the times, places, and circumstances under which liquor may be sold. "</text>
            <text syncTime="384.501" offset="1682322">Put another way, this Court stated in California Liquor Dealers v. Midcal that the Twenty-First Amendment grants the states virtually complete control over whether to permit importation or sale of liquor and how to structure the liquor distribution system.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.878" offset="1759749">In resolving conflicts between state alcohol regulations and Federal policies, the Court has first sought to determine whether the state regulation that was involved implicates what this Court has generally characterized as a Section 2 core power.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.459" offset="1842087">The Court has suggested that when a state has attempted to directly regulate a Section 2 core power under the Twenty-First Amendment that it will prevail irrespective of its conflict with a contrary Federal policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.687" offset="1915021">The state would submit to the Court, recognizing that this Court has never formally offered a clear delineation of what constitutes a Section 2 core power, that the ability of a state to determine for its own inhabitants or for its own... the people found within its borders, the age at which a person will be allowed to consume an alcoholic beverage is central to the power reserved to the states under the Twenty-First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.776" offset="2051380">This Court, as I indicated earlier, recognized that a state has the absolute power of prohibition--</text>

            <text syncTime="538.334" offset="2297663">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in direct response to Justice Blackmun's question concerning the ability of the states to still have a choice even in the face of Section 158, I would submit to the Court that that is erroneous or that assumption is in error for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.414" offset="2377911">One, it presupposes that the Federal Government has the ability to regulate in the face of the Twenty-First Amendment the age at which a state such as South Dakota sets its minimum drinking age, and secondly, it is in direct contradiction to the legislative history that surrounds the original amendment in its debate over what was then contained as a Section 3 to the amendment, which would have given Congress concurrent power to regulate or prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquors where those liquors were to be drunk on the premises sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.372" offset="2537780">At that time, unlike the inconsistencies that were present in the debate over Section 2, there was no inconsistency in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.561" offset="2574561">It was the intent of Congress by deletion of Section 3 to remove the Federal Government from the area of alcohol regulation within a state from which it had in the opinion of Congress and in the opinion of this Court had trespassed.</text>

            <text syncTime="676.241" offset="2849264">I recognize, however, this Court's decisions in regards to the commerce clause in the face of the Tenth Amendment, and that the Tenth Amendment does not in and of itself operate as a limitation on Congress's power.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.834" offset="2907570">I think the distinction here is that in the face of the Twenty-First Amendment Congress intended and the states upon ratification of the Amendment assumed that they were going to be given the power to first off determine whether they would permit the sale of alcohol at all, and if they chose to, to enforce the regulations surrounding the sale of that alcohol.</text>

            <text syncTime="1479.999" offset="6064311">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I propose to argue two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.485" offset="6086254">First, that Section 2 of the Twenty-First Amendment does not reach this case at all because it does not say that Congress may not in the valid exercise of its own powers bar or encourage states to bar sales of alcoholic beverages that a state might prefer to permit, and second, that Section 158 is a judicious and proper use of the Federal spending power that does not violate either the Tenth Amendment or, if it is applicable at all, the Twenty-First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.861" offset="6239749">Section 2 of the Twenty-First Amendment prohibits transportation or importation of alcoholic beverages for delivery or use in violation of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.085" offset="6288650">It thus broadly confirms state power to restrict those activities, notwithstanding obstacles to state regulation that would otherwise be imposed by the commerce clause and sometimes other provisions of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.214" offset="6357091">Section 2 may also in some situations prevent Congress from legislating to require or permit activities that violate state law although in every actual case... I think of Crisp and Midcal and 324 Liquor... the Federal statute prevailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.793" offset="6439429">But Section 2 speaks only of activities in violation of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.797" offset="6463462">I suggest that the words simply cannot be read to prohibit Congress from imposing restrictions of its own or encouraging states to impose additional restrictions on alcohol transactions.</text>

I don't suggest that it is politically likely... to adopt the statute that was envisioned in Clark Distilling, that statute would not involve any transportation, importation, delivery, or use of alcoholic beverages in violation of state law and therefore would not be prohibited by Section 2 of the Twenty-First Amendment.</text>
