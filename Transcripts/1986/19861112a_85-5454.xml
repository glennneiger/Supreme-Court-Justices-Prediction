            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="76.750" offset="448330">You say the Court's holding could be based on a legal error, on a narrow constitutional ground, or on a broad constitutional ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.404" offset="474870">Is there some non-constitutional ground on which we could reverse the Supreme Court of Mississippi here?</text>

            <text syncTime="89.724" offset="500157">That's in essence what I meant with the legal error.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.093" offset="517711">That ground... if the Court will recall, the basis that the Mississippi Supreme Court had for finding this error harmless was that the Mississippi Supreme Court said the trial judge had erred in previous rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.769" offset="572359">The Mississippi Supreme Court also went on to find that the trial judge had made his previous Witherspoon rulings based on the trial judge's belief that the jurors weren't being sincere with him when they said that they had scruples that would prevent their being seated in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.933" offset="649055">In finding that the trial judge didn't believe them and then going on to say, well, they shouldn't have been excused, the Mississippi Supreme Court misunderstood Witt.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.824" offset="696598">I think to make sense Witt has to be read to mean that jurors should only be excused if they honestly maintain scruples that prevent or substantially impair them.</text>

            <text syncTime="152.731" offset="752186">Well, then if that is your example of legal error, which I believe was one of the things, that itself would be a constitutional ground, wouldn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="165.022" offset="801401">I think what Mississippi did is misunderstand Witt in that one respect, and I think without going into a very broad analysis of Davis this Court can say: You misunderstood Witt; if the trial court did not believe those earlier jurors, he wasn't wrong, and therefore we don't even get to this offsetting penalties concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.852" offset="884679">This Court also must recognize, in reaching its conclusion, the clear distinction between the jury function of fact finding in the guilt-innocence phase and the discretionary function involved in determining whether a particular community, a particular community, believes that the appropriate sentence in a particular case is death.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.718" offset="976108">The voir dire in this case was an alternating type voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.955" offset="993140">It didn't alternate on each particular juror, but alternated on the panels.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.824" offset="1008604">To start with, twelve jurors were seated, they were questioned by the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.276" offset="1026368">He exercised some peremptory challenges, one juror was excused for cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="227.298" offset="1050505">The prosecutor stayed on his feet, questioned again until he was satisfied with the twelve in the box.</text>

            <text syncTime="328.461" offset="1455089">The tenth juror was Mrs. Bounds, who was excused over complaints by the defense counsel that she was qualified to sit.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.817" offset="1484555">Mrs. Bounds' voir dire begins at 529 and 530 of the trial record, which is just a little bit before what you have in your joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.173" offset="1517992">It starts with the judge asking Mrs. Bounds two questions:</text>

            <text syncTime="658.743" offset="2776258">She at the end very clearly said, I could reach a verdict and I could impose the death penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="689.595" offset="2899661">Mr. Stegall, the defense lawyer at trial, never asked Mrs. Bounds any questions at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="733.624" offset="3075830">That is, you erred against the state by denying their motions, therefore it's okay to err against the defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1112.319" offset="4590515">There is some discussion by the Respondent and the amici that this case is governed by Lockhart and that because of Lockhart jurors with scruples don't comprise a recognized group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.066" offset="4681525">Just very briefly, I think Lockhart makes it very clear that there is a special context for capital sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.637" offset="4707857">The jury's function in capital sentencing is not the very strictly channeled fact finding of guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.825" offset="4736591">I think it's discretionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.192" offset="4742025">It involves representation of that community's beliefs, perhaps moral outrage, perhaps mercy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.598" offset="4771700">It's based on the weighing of factors that an appellate court can't go back and say this weighing was appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.137" offset="4809839">How can we compare age of a defendant versus the way the crime was committed?</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.441" offset="4831050">It simply isn't... it isn't something that can be replicated or even viewed critically by an appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.297" offset="4866472">This court in the Bobby Caldwell case talked about the appellate court's inability to glean from the record the intangibles of a jury's decision to sentence to death or not to sentence to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.537" offset="4915478">I think those comments are quite appropriate here in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.476" offset="4951213">The only other point I would touch on is, there is some argument by the amici and the Respondent that this Court has already used a harmless error standard in death penalty cases in the context of Zant versus Stephens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.402" offset="5018923">That case in part is completely distinguishable from this case; in part, it supports Petitioner's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.924" offset="5052986">Very briefly, you have to look to the metaphor used by the Georgia Supreme Court, which involved the pyramid and the narrowing effect of the jury selection, of the jury selection of who is eligible and then who deserves the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.768" offset="5112337">The function of aggravating factors in Georgia was simply to see which defendants were death eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.040" offset="5141489">Therefore, the finding of one or ten aggravating factors was no different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.027" offset="5165417">Any one beyond the first was a redundancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.229" offset="5178165">In a case like this, in this instance, where Mississippi requires a unanimous verdict, a decision to improperly excuse one juror cannot be considered a redundancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.870" offset="5232813">She could have been the juror that saved Mr. Gray's life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.024" offset="5249427">A failure to reach a unanimous verdict results in a life sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.761" offset="5276281">The other point, just to go back to Mr. Justice Scalia's question about 100 percent versus very likely versus the harmless error, which is a reasonable possibility that it couldn't affect this verdict, I would submit that it's the prosecutor, the state, the Respondent, who must establish harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt in this kind of an error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.447" offset="5399057">We're not dealing with something like defective assistance of counsel, where the prosecutor can't control what happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.053" offset="5429463">Clearly, this prosecutor did control what happened.</text>

            <text syncTime="1411.980" offset="5789221">In this case the Mississippi Supreme Court held that the force and effect of the trial court's ruling in this case was to correct an error that he had committed in refusing to dismiss other jurors for cause after they had unequivocally stated that they could not vote to impose the death penalty in any circumstance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1446.367" offset="5926730">And I think that is a finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.833" offset="5932581">It says the court is of the opinion... and that's on page 26 of the joint appendix:</text>

            <text syncTime="1465.428" offset="6003008">So I think the trial court is clearly recognizing his error there, that he has made a mess, as he said himself, and created this situation that we have a juror who, he says in his findings of fact, also that she can't make up her mind.</text>

            <text syncTime="1736.237" offset="7086253">So the state was forced to use peremptories in those five cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.440" offset="7107047">There are three jurors there that they used peremptories on that are in the joint appendix, and of course those are clearly jurors that that was the proper use of a peremptory, for the use of a peremptory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.062" offset="7153545">So we have a trial record, of course, that is very confusing, and this confusion, we submit, is cleared up by the Mississippi Supreme Court in holding the trial court was correct in correcting the errors there from forcing them to use peremptory challenges.</text>

            <text syncTime="2812.362" offset="11390710">Looking at the Mississippi Supreme Court opinion that deals with this issue, maybe I'll confuse it more, but I'll take my try.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.301" offset="11426446">Justice Dan Lee at 47 starts discussing the problem with the excusal, and he goes through this dissertation about the twelve angry men and how jurors are often reluctant to serve, and really capsulizes the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.144" offset="11489871">He then talks about how voir dire should have been done by the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.048" offset="11509515">And then on page 49 he discusses that it is abundantly clear from the record that the trial court refused to strike because he believed them insincere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.439" offset="11555073">After that, there is never a finding that the trial court was wrong in believing them insincere.</text>

            <text syncTime="2935.927" offset="11884947">This trial judge did not correct prior rulings because he didn't change them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.597" offset="11915667">I would also argue that his excusal of Mrs. Schleh on cause grounds showed that he knew how to... he knew what Witherspoon was about and could apply it when he thought the jurors were sincere and could refuse to apply it when the jurors were insincere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.773" offset="11972405">Additionally, there are a number of places in the record where the trial judge and the prosecutor talk about jurors using this as an excuse to get off the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.398" offset="12014828">The prosecutor asked Mr. Lassabe:</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.981" offset="12025172">"Do you believe that or are you just telling me that to get off the jury? "</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.902" offset="12044921">I think it was a clear problem, a problem that could have been corrected as soon as it raised its head by stopping, excusing everyone else, and going to an individual voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.109" offset="12085672">But once we got to Mrs. Bounds, I think Justice Blackmun is absolutely correct, the only way to fix the problem is to throw everyone out and start over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.096" offset="12117646">Just as a matter of record, this wasn't a special venire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.298" offset="12130498">This was the regular venire that was summoned here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.333" offset="12142619">The prosecutor... the judge had talked the defense lawyer out of a special venire because you had to tell the jurors that they were being summoned for a capital case, State versus David Gray, and they all agreed that they didn't want jurors looking out for the David Gray publicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.176" offset="12201969">So this was just the regular venire of a couple hundred people.</text>
