            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="146896">We will hear argument now in Number 85-2121, Arizona versus William Carl Mauro.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.517" offset="184930">Mr. Roberts, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jack_roberts" startTime="12.228" stopTime="272.859">
            <label>Mr. Jack Roberts</label>
            <text syncTime="12.228" offset="195797">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.261" offset="207918">The Arizona Supreme Court has said that permitting William Carl Mauro's wife, at her insistence and against the advice of a detective, to speak with him with an officer present constituted the functional equivalent of custodial interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.752" offset="273851">We maintain that in reaching that conclusion, the Arizona Supreme Court misapplied this Court's reasoning, analysis and concerns in both the Miranda and Rhode Island versus Innis decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.839" offset="318155">When we hearken back to Innis, it explained in detail what Miranda meant and that encompasses this Court's definition of custodial interrogation and the functional equivalent of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.999" offset="370818">We find that the Court's concerns, as voiced in Innis, were that the combination of interrogation and custody might work a compulsion upon the will of the accused that might subject him to the will of his examiner and undermine his privilege against compulsory self-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.359" offset="444274">However, this Court also said in Innis an important thing that was ignored by the Arizona Supreme Court in its analysis here, and that was that interrogation as conceived in Miranda and as clarified in Innis had to involve a degree of compulsion, and that must be police compulsion, above that which is necessarily inherent in custody itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.397" offset="544480">Now, the only thing, Your Honors, that happened in this case was that Linda Mauro insisted upon seeing her husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.000" offset="574886">The police acquiesced in that request, and that an officer was present for valid reasons, the trial court found, and the officer overheard incriminating statements and tape recorded them with a tape recorder that was in full view, of which Mr. Mauro was aware, and the trial court also specifically made that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.203" offset="647611">We submit that simply is not the functional equivalent of custodial interrogation under this Court's cases under Miranda or under Rhode Island versus Innis.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.849" offset="690243">That requires an added degree of compulsion above that which is inherent in custody itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.305" offset="712081">That simply is not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.165" offset="719500">This Court also said in Innis that "interrogation" means words or actions on the part of the police, that police should know are reasonably likely to provoke an incriminating response.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.587" offset="793165">But one has to read that in conjunction with the other requirement and the other part of the definition of interrogation, and that is, it has to reflect compulsion above and beyond that which is inherent in custody itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.045" offset="839036">That simply... that test is not made here, and this Court, reversing the Rhode Island Supreme Court in Innis, noted that where two patrolmen were talking in a patrol car in the presence of the defendant and expressed their concern about some child at a school for the handicapped finding the shotgun that Innis had concealed, this Court said that the Rhode Island Supreme Court correctly found that there was some degree of subtle compulsion but that was not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.683" offset="949587">And there, we have police doing the talking right in the defendant's presence and the defendant, of course, in the back of the patrol car was a captive audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.948" offset="982605">So, we submit that the standard of Innis is simply not met in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.941" offset="1002563">Very simply, there was no interrogation within the meaning of Innis, which clarified Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.763" offset="1021894">This Court said in Innis also that not all statements obtained after one has been arrested are necessarily barred from use and that totally volunteered statements do not violate the Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.924" offset="1086573">We have cited to this Court the Seventh Circuit's decision in United States ex rel. Church versus DeRobertis.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.418" offset="1116561">There, Kelly Church, the older brother of Michael Church, asked the police to please place him in the cell with his brother Michael, and he told the police he was going to try to persuade Michael to confess to get their younger brother, Casey, out of trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.150" offset="1179464">Police, knowing Kelly was going to try to persuade Michael to confess, did place him in Michael's cell.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.346" offset="1208199">The Seventh Circuit said that is not the equivalent of custodial interrogation by the police under Rhode Island versus Innis.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="272.859" offset="1238292">Mr. Roberts, are you asking that we cut back on Rhode Island against Innis?</text>

            <text syncTime="279.393" offset="1264414">I am simply saying that the standard you enunciated there does not apply to the facts of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="283.756" offset="1281864">You don't think this is just a fact bound application of Innis?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jack_roberts" startTime="286.938" stopTime="352.951">
            <label>Mr. Jack Roberts</label>
            <text syncTime="286.938" offset="1294612">No, Your Honor, because whether or not it was interrogation is a question of law, and I am submitting that as a question of law the Arizona Supreme Court was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.474" offset="1328780">But what I am saying was, the Seventh Circuit rejected a similar attack by Michael Church in the case we have cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.170" offset="1375487">The approach used there was a "but-for" test, and I submit to you with all respect, that is exactly what the Arizona Supreme Court has applied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.126" offset="1411327">Michael Church says,</text>
            <text syncTime="318.269" offset="1419895">"But for the police putting my older brother in the cell with me and knowing when they put him there that he was going to try to persuade me to confess, I would not have confessed. "</text>
            <text syncTime="327.295" offset="1456049">Well, Kelly Church was successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.186" offset="1463572">His brother later asked for a pencil and paper and wrote out a confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.919" offset="1478514">Here the Arizona Supreme Court has said, and I do not think I oversimplify, the police simply cannot let the defendant's wife talk to him even at her request and against their advice and stand there and listen.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.577" offset="1525116">That is the holding of the Arizona Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.039" offset="1535043">Church rejected a similar claim and we ask this Court to do the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="360.635" offset="1589378">I think it would be critical, perhaps in a Sixth Amendment context, Your Honor, but respondent has conceded at page 9 of her answering brief and the Arizona Supreme Court's opinion makes it abundantly clear that they decided this on purely Fifth Amendment grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.216" offset="1643712">Let me put it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.988" offset="1654788">I don't think under the circumstances of this case it would make any difference, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.030" offset="1670984">I don't think there would have been a Sixth Amendment or a Fifth Amendment violation because there was no interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.174" offset="1687494">There was no compulsion by police.</text>

            <text syncTime="400.012" offset="1746844">Well, if the right to counsel had been invoked, Your Honor, I would be taking precisely the same position because what was it police did?</text>
            <text syncTime="407.188" offset="1775578">She wanted to talk to her husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.069" offset="1783102">They allowed her to.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.318" offset="1788117">They had a policeman stationed there for valid reasons, the trial court found after the suppression hearing even though the Arizona Supreme Court did not mention those valid reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.785" offset="1825943">The line of cases this Court has decided under the Sixth Amendment, Massiah, Henry, Olton versus Maine, cases like that have been concerned with surreptitious questioning by an informant or agent of the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.495" offset="1880800">No one disputes here... it is conceded, plainly conceded, that Linda Mauro was not an agent or informant of the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.957" offset="1906713">Yet it was at her request, her idea to see her husband and certainly nothing was done surreptitiously.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.153" offset="1927507">The testimony of Detective Manson at trial and at the suppression hearing was that they were in a small room, Captain Latham's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.967" offset="1958749">It has a few chairs, bookshelves, and Captain Latham's desk but no one was seated at the desk.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.360" offset="1980274">They were seated in chairs in the middle of the room and Detective Manson, who had told Linda Mauro she might see her husband but he was going to be present and he was going to record it, sat within three to four feet of Mr. Mauro with a tape recorder on top of his knee.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.212" offset="2047670">He had his legs crossed and the tape recorder was on top of his knee.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.744" offset="2057805">The trial court specifically found Mauro knew the police were listening, the man was only three feet from him, and that he was also being recorded.</text>

            <text syncTime="526.925" offset="2254560">As a matter of fact, this Court recently decided a case, not precisely on point but similar in some respects, the name of the case, I am sorry...

            <text syncTime="545.718" offset="2329688">Now, the police had told Lee, now just listen, don't try to stimulate conversation about what he has been charged with, just listen.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.242" offset="2359781">And this Court upheld the admission of statements that Wilson made to Lee on that basis, and of course that was surreptitious.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.158" offset="2395516">I mean, Wilson didn't know that Lee was a government informant and he certainly didn't know he was being recorded, and we don't even have circumstances like that here.</text>

            <text syncTime="629.955" offset="2666667">The Arizona Supreme Court further held, and we submit most erroneously, that the State could not even use this brief tape in rebuttal, and in so doing it relied upon this Court's holding in Wainwright versus Greenfield.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.153" offset="2719435">We submit that was grievous error because this tape was used only in rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.517" offset="2744930">The trial court's findings, which I urge you to scrutinize, are at pages 216 through 220 of the joint appendices, and he made very complete and specific findings on all of these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.066" offset="2795085">The trial court held that... well, first let me set the stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.308" offset="2808042">Let me tell you what defense counsel had done in building the insanity defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.350" offset="2824238">First of all, this tape was not needed and certainly was not used to prove that Mr. Mauro committed the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.564" offset="2849107">He admitted that to numerous people at a Circle-K shortly after he had done it.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.438" offset="2864571">It wasn't needed to prove the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.829" offset="2874184">All it was needed for was to show his mental state to rebut his insanity defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.681" offset="2889544">What defense counsel had done was to put on the stand Bruce Griffin, a defense attorney, who say Mr. Mauro the day of the murder, November 23rd, 1982, but he saw him later in the day after Mauro had talked with his wife, later in the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.630" offset="2953387">Everything the defense counsel presented on the day of the murder, so far as the conversations, or later in the day after the tape between Mauro and his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.256" offset="2987869">Mr. Griffin described Mr. Mauro, and I summarize but fairly, as a salivating or slobbering catatonic madman.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.571" offset="3021097">That was the gist of his description.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.105" offset="3031232">Then, relying upon their psychiatrist, the defense psychiatrist, Dean Gerstenburger, Mr. Gerstenburger also observed Mauro later in the day, even later than Mr. Griffin observed him.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.880" offset="3082328">Gerstenburger got in a good many hearsay statements from Mr. Mauro in his response.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.677" offset="3113570">But more important than that, Gerstenburger relied upon a tape recording, Exhibit 172, which was admitted at defense counsel's request, a tape recording between another defense attorney, Donald Bayliss, and Mr. Mauro.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.818" offset="3174070">Now, Your Honors, what is so important to realize about this, and I know you have either heard the tape or you will, is when you hear Mr. Bayliss asking Mr. Mauro questions, and this is on the day of the murder but later than the conversation between Mauro and his wife, when you hear Bayliss asking him questions what you hear in response from Mauro, and that's why defense counsel wanted it before the jury, is unintelligible animal-like sounds more similar to grunting and moans than anything else, thus portraying him to the jury as an incoherent, irrational person sounding more like an animal than anything else.</text>

            <text syncTime="864.607" offset="3605299">But what I am saying is, if the Court disagrees with that, our position is that it was not fundamentally unfair to allow the prosecutor to use this brief exchange between Mauro and his wife to show several things.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.966" offset="3654723">That is the reason we present that argument also.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.027" offset="3662978">The trial court found it was probative, the most probative and relevant thing that the prosecutor could present in rebuttal for the following reasons, and please let me apprise you of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.736" offset="3705818">Number one, it showed more plainly than anything else that prosecution could present Mauro's state of mind closest to the time he committed the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.279" offset="3743957">The tape between Mauro and his wife was the closest thing to the time he committed the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.113" offset="3763288">Defense counsel, in a lengthy cross examination of Linda Mauro who was on the stand at least three days, had also through that examination and through eight pages he devoted in closing argument, attempted to portray her to the jury as being at least partially, if not wholly responsible for the child's brutal murder by suffocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.347" offset="3844267">Having done that, the trial court concluded, it was legitimate and not fundamentally unfair to allow the prosecutor to let the jury hear the tape where they could hear Mauro's voice, judge for themselves his thinking, his intimations, his pauses, and hear his wife's voice because of the accusations and implications that defense counsel had been making against her.</text>

            <text syncTime="1238.276" offset="5099921">Now, at the time of his arrest Nichols had invoked his Miranda rights, right to remain silent, the right to have counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.339" offset="5124163">He invoked that, but a half-hour later he made a statement saying that he did what he did because of duress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.285" offset="5151957">Well, Nichols didn't even take the stand as Mauro did not take the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.087" offset="5171183">But his defense attorney was able to get in that testimony though another witness, through a police officer who said that,</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.682" offset="5197619">"Yes, he told me he did what he did because of duress. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.054" offset="5207023">Now, the Eleventh Circuit said there is nothing in Greenfield... or Doyle versus Ohio, that prohibits this use of it because what this man did was rely on his Miranda rights, but then he argued... his defense attorney argued and got in evidence that something he did post-Miranda warning, when he made his statement about duress, proved his innocence, and they said, when you are going to use post-Miranda statements like that, and specifically rely on their proximity in time to your arrest for your defense, then we don't believe Greenfield or Doyle prohibits the prosecution from impeaching you with even the defendant's own prior silence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.031" offset="5366997">This Court has said, and even if the Court should disagree about there being a Fifth Amendment violation, this Court has said in cases such as Harris versus New York and Oregon versus Haas, that even where a Fifth Amendment violation has occurred, and we submit one did not here, that that does not mean the State is forever prohibited from using the evidence in any fashion thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.196" offset="5475667">The Court will well recall that those cases involved absence of Miranda warnings, or proper Miranda warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.190" offset="5499595">Defendants who took the stand and then were impeached with prior inconsistent statements because they were voluntary... and let me point out here, there has never been any question that Mauro's brief comments to his wife were voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.190" offset="5551631">The trial court so specifically found, and I point out, Dr. Gerstenburger, the defense psychiatrist, himself said that the comments were voluntary and that they showed that at that moment that Mauro made them, he was much more in touch with reality than he was at the times later in the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.290" offset="5619967">Why was that important?</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.391" offset="5624460">Dr. Gerstenburger testified that Mauro fluctuated in and out, in and out of reality for three weeks prior to the day he committed the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.805" offset="5654031">So, as the trial court noted, it was extremely probative and relevant for the jury to hear this short tape between him and his wife to see how much in touch with reality he was, with reality he was, at the time closest to the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.145" offset="5711396">But in any case, in Harris versus New York and in other cases, this Court has said as long as the statements are voluntary, and they were here, and the trial court made a separate finding they were voluntary, knowing and intelligent, he made a separate finding on all three prongs, that they may be used in impeachment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2918.670" offset="11821541">You are saying that he had invoked his right to counsel, and under Edwards the police cannot initiate interrogation, and so that if the police officer had walked in unannounced with the wife and said to the man,</text>

            <text syncTime="2961.672" offset="11993531">The police officers testified that basically what they went in there to do was find out what was going on, and I think it's also important to remember that it was possible to get the husband and the wife together and take care of the problem of escape by allowing... and take care of the problem of her safety by allowing them, if that's what their motives were, to speak in the jail facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.852" offset="12186210">There was testimony that they could have... and then everybody knew that they were getting ready to take Bill Mauro over to the jail and there are facilities there that they could have allowed Bill and Linda to talk together, if that's what they had so desired to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.232" offset="12247755">The fact of the matter is, they wanted to find out what was going on.</text>

            <text syncTime="3031.539" offset="12273041">They wanted to find out if the two were going to concoct stories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.261" offset="12291849">And in doing that, their motive in going in there and listening and even taking a tape recorder in there was to accumulate incriminating evidence, to see what they could get.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.861" offset="12350259">I would submit that that, in and of itself, shows that the activity by the police department that was so condemned by the Arizona Supreme Court amounted to the functional equivalent of custodial interrogation under Rhode Island versus Innis, that the intent of the police officers by their own testimony was so clear, and what the Arizona Supreme Court was saying was, that activity is going to be condemned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.723" offset="12481707">We are not going to allow in the tape recording which was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.685" offset="12493619">I think that the Arizona Supreme Court also said that just because you invoke the insanity defense, we are not going to make an exception for you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.311" offset="12540117">We are not going to hold that your Miranda rights, even though they may have been violated, are going to... the fruits of the evidence drawn from that are not going to be allowed in through the back door, if you will, because you invoked the insanity defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.304" offset="12616081">I think for those reasons the Arizona Supreme Court was correct in finding that this was the functional equivalent of custodial interrogation and that the tape was correctly held to be suppressed by that Court.</text>
