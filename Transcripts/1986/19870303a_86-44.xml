            <text syncTime="38.453" offset="303228">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue in this case is whether lower courts can refuse to enforce agreements to arbitrate claims under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and RICO, notwithstanding the clear Congressional directive in the Arbitration Act that agreements to arbitrate shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.442" offset="415137">The parties in this case contracted to arbitrate all of their disputes with respect to the handling of respondent's securities accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.220" offset="446275">The Court of Appeals enforced that contract with respect to the parties' common law claims but refused to enforce that contract with respect to the claims pertaining to Section 10(b) and RICO, notwithstanding the fact that these claims arose from the same set of factual allegations pertaining to the common law claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.493" offset="531329">Petitioners are here today on appeal from the decision of the Second Circuit, and ask this Court to enforce the contract of the parties with respect to all of their disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.270" offset="574483">The parties' contracts should be enforced with respect to 10(b) claims because Congress did not intend to create an exception to the Federal Arbitration Act for claims under Section 10(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="119.140" offset="625892">Congress enacted the Exchange Act in 1934, just nine years after it passed the Arbitration Act in 1925.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.292" offset="662568">If Congress had intended to create an exception to the Arbitration Act, Section 10(b), it simply had to state within the statute itself that such an exception was to be created and it simply could have prohibited within the statute itself arbitration of 10(b) claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.253" offset="730382">This it did not do, and for this reason alone it is clear that the Arbitration Act contains no exception for 10(b) claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.172" offset="766013">Despite the Congressional silence in the Exchange Act, the Exchange Act does contain an antiwaiver provision of the type that this Court in Wilko v. Swann found in 1953 prohibited arbitration of Section 12-2 claims under the 1933 Securities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.306" offset="838634">Section 14 of that Act voided stipulations binding a person to waive compliance with a provision of the 1903 Securities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.145" offset="877922">The Wilko court held that because of the unique special &lt;twelve two&gt; [= 12-2] right created by Congress in the Securities Act, which was substantially different from common law fraud, and that it switched the burden of proof from the plaintiff buyer to the seller defendant in that case, as well as because of the Wilko court's concerns about the adequacy of the arbitral forum to enforce the special right and the adequacy of judicial review of the arbitrator's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.478" offset="991293">The Wilko court as a result of this analysis of Section 14 to prohibit waiver of judicial trial and review, notwithstanding the fact that nowhere in the statute or its legislative history did Congress indicate any evidence that it wanted to use that interpretation of an antiwaiver provision, which in fact was quite contrary to the interpretation of an antiwaiver provision at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.075" offset="1105710">Petitioners believe that the Wilko court's interpretation of a antiwaiver provision must be limited to Section 12-2 of the Securities Act for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.290" offset="1150536">First, Wilko's interpretation of an antiwaiver provision with respect to Congressional intent cannot be mechanically applied to Section 10(b) claims as Justice White pointed out in his concurring opinion in the Byrd case in 1985.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.892" offset="1216887">It simply cannot be said that for an implied, judicially implied cause of action such as 10(b) that Congress intended an antiwaiver provision to prohibit judicial trial and review of the cause of action that it itself did not create.</text>

            <text syncTime="443.102" offset="1921775">However, the courts that have examined that particular concept of applying the Wilko analysis in 12-2 to Section 10(b) claims since the concurring opinion in the Byrd case, the majority of those courts have ruled in favor of petitioner and have held that these 10(b) claims should be arbitrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.909" offset="1988962">The second reason that petitioners feel that the Wilko analysis is limited to Section 12(b) is that the Wilko courts paid such deference to the special right in Section 12(b), the switching of the burden of proof to the seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.199" offset="2046118">The Wilko court felt that arbitrators could not understand the legal interpretations of the statute without judicial instruction on the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.821" offset="2080599">Certainly they also felt that there was inadequate judicial review under the Arbitration Act with respect to Section 12-2.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.724" offset="2116230">However, as the Wilko court pointed out, their concerns were based on the fact that Section 12-2 is substantially different from common law fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.189" offset="2150085">As Justice White pointed out in his concurring opinion in Byrd, the 10(b) action, while different from common law fraud, is not that much different to create the type of concerns that the Wilko court had in 1953.</text>

            <text syncTime="966.751" offset="4016377">I understand the point you are making, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.063" offset="4021602">However, it has been our experience that arbitration proceedings are usually completed within one year of when they are instituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.826" offset="4044694">Finally, although obviously the Court is not required to do so to find in petitioner's favor in this case, we think the best approach in this case would be to acknowledge that Wilko should be decided differently today in light of these changes in arbitration as well as recent decisions of this Court which emphasize the examination of Congressional intent with whether or not Congress... with respect to whether Congress has created an exception to the Federal Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.643" offset="4155976">The Wilko court's antiwaiver analysis seems to be focused more on public policy concerns of the Wilko court than on an analysis of Congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.312" offset="4194637">Certainly nowhere in the Exchange Act or its legislative history did Congress ever state that it intended an antiwaiver provision to be applicable to a judicial forum selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.900" offset="4232985">The true meaning of the antiwaiver provision as developed in common law was to void waiver of substantive compliance with the statute, and certainly in arbitration proceedings an individual does not waive substantive compliance with the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.317" offset="4286588">The individual simply switches the forum where those rights will be adjudicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.127" offset="4301843">The parties' agreement should also be enforced with respect to the arbitration of RICO claims because again Congress did not intend to exempt RICO claims from the Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.638" offset="4355969">Once again, Congress could simply have prohibited arbitration of RICO claims within the statute itself, which it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.308" offset="4382614">Furthermore, there is nothing in the legislative history which evidences any Congressional intent to prohibit arbitration of RICO claims, nor is there an antiwaiver provision of the type which the Wilko court relied upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.943" offset="4429112">The Court of Appeals' concern with the public nature of RICO claims is also misplaced, because while RICO has an incidental public deterrent function, the legislative history indicates that its primary function is to compensate victims of organized crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.984" offset="4493269">By ruling that either 10(b) or RICO claims are not arbitrable, this Court would have to decide that Congress intended to repeal the Arbitration Act by implication when it enacted the Securities Act and RICO.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.245" offset="4546350">Such repeals by implication have always been disfavored by this Court, and are inapplicable here where the statutes can coexist without conflict since the statutory rights of the individuals can be enforced by arbitrators subject to review as limited by Congress in the Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.222" offset="4606222">In conclusion, the case before the Court today involves allegations that an investor's account was mishandled by his stockbroker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.343" offset="4646764">Petitioners feel that arbitrators are better equipped than juries to handle these primarily factual disputes and have done so for years, and there is no reason to burden the federal courts with these types of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.979" offset="4697233">Furthermore, the SRO arbitration forums in this case have experienced arbitrators, including former judges and securities attorneys, always have a majority of panelists from the public, and operate pursuant to rules approved by the SEC after public hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.301" offset="4758568">Petitioners feel that the continued SEC supervision and rulemaking authority ensure that statutory rights will be enforced through arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.719" offset="4792214">By enforcing contracts to arbitrate 10(b) and RICO claims the Court will allow these claims to be heard by the same arbitrators who hear the parties' state and common law claims arising from the same factual patterns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.402" offset="4839026">This will avoid the bifurcating proceedings and duplicative proceedings which otherwise result in the very type of delay which Congress hoped to avoid when it passed the Arbitration Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1189.395" offset="4906944">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the Securities and Exchange Commission agrees with petitioners that the arbitration agreement at issue in this case should be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.888" offset="4988968">Our argument is in three steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.948" offset="5001194">First, the agreement at issue is a valid contract, and the Federal Arbitration Act requires that it be enforced unless that Act is superseded by another federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.960" offset="5045184">Second, the antiwaiver provision of the Securities Exchange Act, which is alleged to be the superseding statute, only invalidates waivers of the substantive protections of the securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.439" offset="5099101">Third, there is no waiver of substantive protection where there is an adequate remedy for violations of the Act, and arbitration is an adequate remedy when it takes place in a forum that is subject to the SEC's regulatory oversight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.119" offset="5165870">The contract in this case provides for arbitration in such a forum, and should therefore be enforced.</text>

            <text syncTime="1518.715" offset="6224247">There has been... as far as I know that increase is commensurate with the general increase in litigation in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.524" offset="6263430">I believe there are extensive statistics in one of the amicus briefs that detail the increase in claims both in the federal courts and in arbitrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.146" offset="6301987">If one begins with the Arbitration Act and its command that Arbitration agreements be enforced the question then becomes whether there is some overriding federal statute, and the only statutory provision that is alleged to furnish that kind of overriding command is the antiwaiver provision of the Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.010" offset="6405432">Now, as I have suggested, that provision does not concern itself with all waivers of procedural rights or rights to particular forums, because any such reading would presumably invalidate settlements of lawsuits, post-dispute arbitration agreements, and even predispute arbitration agreements in the international context which this Court approved in Scherk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.453" offset="6499159">Rather, the concern of that provision is with, as its language concerning compliance suggests, is with the substantive protections of the Acts, of the securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.698" offset="6544195">If a customer waived any adequate remedy for violations of the Act that would be prohibited by the antiwaiver provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.571" offset="6575646">But where a customer agrees to arbitrate any future disputes and the arbitral forum is an adequate remedy for valid complaints, there has been no waiver of compliance with the duties under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.408" offset="6631026">That is precisely what we believe to be the case with agreements to arbitrate under a self-regulatory organization, and there are two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.780" offset="6668537">One of them is that this Court in numerous cases in recent years has come to a quite different assessment of the adequacy of arbitration in the commercial area generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.463" offset="6715244">In Mitsubishi, Southland, the Byrd case, this Court has said that there is in general no good reason to question the adequacy of arbitration as an effective remedy for resolving commercial disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.365" offset="6762787">But there is also a second point, and that second reason has to do with the limitation of our argument to arbitrations that take place under the SRO.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.876" offset="6800821">The SEC since 1975 has had a very broad authority to review the rules that govern arbitrations under SROs and to modify them where appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.965" offset="6849200">It is that authority which led to the Uniform Code of Arbitration, and that authority can be used in the future to effect further improvements as the need becomes apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.710" offset="6892250">That oversight authority, which did not exist at the time of Wilko, we think should lead to a different assessment of the adequacy of arbitration because it in effect provides a statutory basis for assuring the adequacy of that remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.845" offset="6956720">That difference means the factual underpinning of Wilko is no longer appropriate today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.419" offset="6999039">We think therefore that an agreement providing for SRO arbitration does not waive the protections of the securities laws, and that for such an agreement there is today no basis in the Exchange Act for overriding the command of the Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.443" offset="7063091">We therefore think that insofar as the judgment below concerns a securities law claim, that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1743.703" offset="7124217">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please this Court, I am here representing the respondents in this case, Eugene McMahon, Julia McMahon, and the four pension trusts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.198" offset="7174163">I am also here representing all of the other individual investors who have pre-dispute arbitration agreements in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.116" offset="7209795">The concerns that they have are the same concerns that are placed before this Court, and that is namely that the pre-dispute arbitration agreement be found to be unenforceable in two contexts, one, in connection with Section 10, and two, in connection with RICO claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.156" offset="7281997">We have heard earlier this morning and this afternoon about the fact that arbitration at the SROs is something that the government now considers to be okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.915" offset="7337063">They didn't before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.992" offset="7341347">Of course, the securities industry always felt that arbitration is beneficial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.522" offset="7367470">However, what is the reason that we have the securities industry coming into this Court and coming into almost every other District Court and Circuit Court in this country trying to get everything into arbitration?</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.797" offset="7424521">I think it is simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.766" offset="7432462">The reason is, they feel they have a leg up when they go to arbitration and the reason for that mainly is because they have a member of their industry sitting on each panel, Typically there are three members on an arbitration panel, We feel if one member is represented by the securities industry the public customer is at a disadvantage from the start.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.692" offset="7536116">Now, Mr. Krebsbach mentioned that there are peremptory challenges available in arbitration, I propose to you according to the Uniform Act there is one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.267" offset="7574464">Furthermore, Mr. Krebsbach stated that there were members of the public who sit as other members on the panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.013" offset="7609468">I present to you the people who sit who are not industry members are sophisticated businessmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.119" offset="7637889">I have looked at the panel list of the American Stock Exchange, which is included in one of the amicus briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.615" offset="7671848">And I note that there are a number of people who are securities litigators, but those people come from the large firms, the firms who typically represent the brokerage companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.409" offset="7715003">I think having the public customer believes that having an industry representative on the panel is very damaging.</text>

            <text syncTime="2155.817" offset="8772648">And I say, and it has been found by eight Circuit Courts, who have followed the Second Circuit reasoning here, that there is a great protective policy written into the federal securities laws, and I am not just talking about the '34 Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2173.623" offset="8843910">And in order to pursue that protective policy Congress created an antiwaiver provision in Section 29A of the '34 Act which we put forth is something that requires that this case and the claims in this case not be sent to arbitration, There is a grant of federal jurisdiction in Section 27.</text>

            <text syncTime="2262.167" offset="9198026">In 1975 the '34 Act was extensively revised, and in that revision there were several instances in which Congress amended Section 28, for example, which gave the rights of members of the securities industries to have arbitrations between themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.751" offset="9300322">So what Congress did there was, they carved out an exception to what they perceived to be the rule of nonarbitrability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.467" offset="9335221">Otherwise they wouldn't have had to pass that amendment to Section 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.777" offset="9352462">Furthermore, Congress enacted in 1975 the Municipal Rulemaking Board, and as part of that section which is Section 15... well, it is found within Section 15, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.751" offset="9456325">It is a subdivision of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.376" offset="9462908">That section specifically provided for an individual to bring an arbitration in connection with a municipal security dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.730" offset="9504286">However, Congress stated in particular that Section 29(a) should be abided by in all respects, which means you cannot enforce a pre-dispute arbitration agreement in connection with municipal securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.693" offset="9560188">Again, this is an exception that Congress would not have had to make if they didn't believe the unenforceability of the provisions of the '34 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.876" offset="9608880">Getting back to arbitration for a second, since the government has stepped in here and taken some of us for a loop and come forward on behalf of the securities industry, I would like to point out that this is a marked departure from their previous positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.756" offset="9704384">In 1979... actually our brief goes back to 1953 where they started criticizing the usage of the so-called pre-dispute arbitration provision that we find in the McMahon case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.671" offset="9784005">We have had an Exchange Act release that the government has promulgated in 1979, and it is Release 15984, which criticized the use of that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.914" offset="9845027">They found that the pre-dispute provision was something that was confusing, it was something that was not fully disclosing the situation to the public customer, and it was something that they frowned upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.018" offset="9901452">In 1983 they went a step further by promulgating Release 20397.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.313" offset="9930604">In that release they said, well, the security industry hasn't been listening to us, so we are not going to promulgate a rule, and they promulgated Rule 15C2-2 which made it a violation for the brokerage industries to contain a pre-dispute arbitration clause in their customer contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.413" offset="10015032">And the reasons that they came out with that is because they felt it was misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.473" offset="10039274">They felt that the public customer was not being protected as he should be under the 1934 Acts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2570.559" offset="10431633">Now, maybe the SEC continues to take the same view as to whether these particular forms give the customer enough notice about what he is letting himself in for.</text>

            <text syncTime="2602.233" offset="10558275">Additionally, of course, you lose your federal procedural protections to broad discovery, which is of extreme importance in a securities fraud case where the brokerage firm is in possession of all of the documents and the customer is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.506" offset="10635388">The right to Judicial review is severely limited in arbitration, and since the arbitrators are told not to give reasons for their awards, it is very unlikely that someone can go into court and say, well, they had manifest disregard for the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.778" offset="10720443">As a matter of fact, the president of the American Arbitration Association has been quoted as saying don't write reasons that can't be criticized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.759" offset="10760358">Again, I believe that if we look to the other rights that a customer is entitled to when he goes to court and examine what he loses when he goes to arbitration, in the context of the federal securities laws and the RICO statute we believe that a customer is not fully protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.795" offset="10876550">I am not suggesting that arbitration is inappropriate in every case, nor am I suggesting that you find that arbitration is no good at all for securities cases, because I find in the Uniform Act that arbitration will be something that a customer might want to utilize for a small claim of $2,500 or $5,000 where he can't hire a lawyer to help him, where there are simplified procedures under the Uniform Act in order to have this thing figured out by letters coming back and forth by the claimant and the brokerage firm has some purpose there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.514" offset="11031404">But for the big case, Justice Scalia, the 10(b) cases, it really has no useful purpose, and we believe the customer is behind the eight-ball when he goes into arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.868" offset="11080828">Now, this Court has balanced the tension between the Federal Arbitration Act and other federal statutes before.</text>

            <text syncTime="2762.169" offset="11198066">In those cases, this Court found that the claimant was entitled to a federal forum, despite the fact that he had gone through arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.335" offset="11238712">A point that was brought out, if I may refer to the form of customer agreements that we have in this case, which, as I said before, the SEC has found for some 30 years to be an improper notification to the customer, the customer who comes into the brokerage relationship is coming in thinking that the broker is going to make money for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.740" offset="11412374">Otherwise he wouldn't go there in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.270" offset="11422405">He is at a position where he is trusting the broker with his dollars or her dollars, as the case may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.705" offset="11448214">The customer, unsophisticated as he may be, isn't aware that he has to read the customer agreement with a fine tooth comb.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.467" offset="11487189">The agreement that we have in front of us is a multipage document.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.544" offset="11503594">Somewhere found on the second page in the middle of Paragraph 13, which starts, by the way, stating that this agreement shall innure to the benefit of your heirs and assigns, we find the sentence which states that all grievances are going to be decided in arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.489" offset="11571303">Well, if you were to uphold that, I think you have to say to the customer, you had better get a lawyer in order to open up a brokerage account, in order to review that agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3210.284" offset="12990483">I mean, in essence their argument is, because we have oversight authority it has to be right because Congress gave us this right in 1975, then the arbitration procedure is fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.167" offset="13054013">However, all of these rules, the Rule 15(c)(2)-2 and each of the releases came after Congress gave them the power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.007" offset="13093406">Additionally, they had the Uniform Code of Arbitration in front of them, and they still came out with these rules and these releases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.832" offset="13132694">Another issue I would like to address briefly which the securities industry has brought up in their amicus brief in support of certiorari is the table that they append in connection with the amount of cases that are before the District Courts, and I would like to point out that statistics can be read in many ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.569" offset="13251603">The way I read these statistics is that for each of the five years that the SIA has compiled the amount of cases brought under all of the securities laws, not just 10(b), but the '33 Act, the '34 Act, and the Commodities Act, taking all of those cases together, they amounted to less than 2 percent of the total cases in the federal docket.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.745" offset="13372394">Now, they did not go into the most recent figures of 1986, which I did, and was advised that in fact the amount of... the amount of cases under all the securities laws have decreased in 1986 to a point beyond the 1984 level, again, less than 2 percent of all the cases that are in this Court.</text>
