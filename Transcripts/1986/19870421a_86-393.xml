            <text syncTime="54.885" offset="364243">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in the 1950s the Army conducted tests regarding the effects of LSD, and respondent was one of the servicemen who participated in those tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.275" offset="413771">He alleges that he was secretly administered LSD on four occasions in February, 1958, at the Army's chemical warfare laboratories while he was supposedly testing gas masks, and that he did not know he had been given LSD until 1975, when the Army asked him to participate in a follow-up study.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.724" offset="503528">He alleges that he sustained mental injuries as a result of taking the drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.295" offset="525889">The procedural history of this case is noteworthy because it shows that respondent gave up on both of his claims during the course of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.817" offset="567894">Respondent's original complaint, which alleged a claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act, was dismissed by the District Court on the basis that respondent had been injured incident to military service and the Fifth Circuit in 1981 held that that claim was barred by this Court's decision in Feres.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.731" offset="647619">Respondent filed an amended complaint that contained an FTCA claim and a Bivens claim as well, but the District Court dismissed the FTCA claim and granted final judgment in favor of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="449.810" offset="1943920">We contend that the Court of Appeals should have dismissed respondent's Bivens claims and should not have resurrected the FTCA claim because this Court's decisions in Feres and Chappell compelled the conclusion that servicemen injured incident to military service may not pursue those sorts of claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.491" offset="2022601">We realize that under the result that we contend is mandated by this Court's decisions respondent is barred from challenging an Army program that was poorly conducted and that may have harmed him, but respondent is not without a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.733" offset="2083623">As we have explained in our briefs, if he was injured as a result of this program he may obtain veterans' benefits, and the Army is not vindicated by a decision holding that he may not pursue damage actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.076" offset="2136912">The Senate has studied the Army's LSD testing program and issued a critical report concerning that program that included instructions to the Army as to how to conduct future chemical weapons tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.217" offset="2193546">Concerning the final judgment entered in favor of the FTCA claim I would like to note only that the whole point of Rule 54B is to resolve a case as to certain issues or as to certain parties, and that this case was resolved in favor of the United States when respondent decided not to appeal that final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.307" offset="2325934">In addition I would like to note that the Eleventh Circuit's jurisdiction in this case was based on its acceptance for interlocutory appeal of the question certified, which was the Bivens question, and the FTCA question was clearly beyond the scope of that certified question.</text>

            <text syncTime="628.377" offset="2658212">In any event, as to the FTCA claim, it is clear that that claim is barred by Feres because respondent was administered LSD incident to his military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.602" offset="2707113">In its 1981 decision in this case, the Fifth Circuit noted that in 1958 respondent was a master sergeant in the Army who had volunteered to participate in an official Army chemical warfare program, that the program was conducted on an Army base by and for the benefit of the Army, that respondent received military pay during the month that he participated in the program, and that he was promised a letter of commendation for his participation.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.788" offset="2823828">I might add as well that in the second amended complaint, Paragraph 11, respondent says that he was on active duty during that month.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.942" offset="2856429">No court disagreed with the conclusion that respondent was participating in this program incident to his military service, not even the Eleventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.582" offset="2894986">It instead held that an FTCA claim is not necessarily barred because the injury on which the claim is based occurred incident to military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.223" offset="2941588">We argued in Johnson, the FTCA case involving a helicopter crash that was argued in this Court in February, that this Court held in Feres shortly after the FTCA was enacted that Congress did not intend to waive sovereign immunity for torts occurring incident to military service, and that there is no reason to revisit that construction of the statute which Congress has not seen fit to alter in 37 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.541" offset="3050780">I will not repeat that argument today but do want to note that this case represents a significant extension of the Eleventh Circuit's erroneous decision in Johnson which distinguished Feres on the basis that the tort feasor there was a civilian air traffic controller who is not in the military chain of command but was instead employed by the Department of Transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.288" offset="3137820">There is no question that the program under which respondent was administered LSD was an Army program.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.525" offset="3162793">It was developed and conducted by the Army Intelligence Board and the Army's chemical warfare laboratories where the tests were conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.750" offset="3203649">While respondent has named some civilian doctors in his second amended complaint they were obviously working for the Army in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.390" offset="3250251">The courts below also erred in refusing to dismiss respondent's Bivens claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.359" offset="3270104">The letter that counsel for respondent sent to the District Court after this Court issued its decision in Chappell v. Wallace explained that this Court</text>
            <text syncTime="790.400" offset="3306258">"held that the same principles which underlie the Feres doctrine and which require absolute immunity from an FTCA action also require immunity from a Bivens constitutional action against Federal officers. "</text>
            <text syncTime="804.041" offset="3360801">That is an accurate description of this Court's holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.029" offset="3376788">Except for the courts below, all of the other courts of Appeals that have considered the question have understood that this Court barred servicemen from bringing Bivens suits against their superiors and did not authorize any case by case inquiry of the sort mandated by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.490" offset="3450663">That is absolutely clear from this Court's opinion in Chappell which reversed the Ninth Circuit opinion that did not authorize the plaintiff to bring their Bivens action but instead remanded the case for application of certain tests similar to those set out in the Fifth Circuit's Mindes v. Seaman case to determine whether the plaintiffs there could proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.439" offset="3542405">This Court rejected that balancing approach, holding instead that enlisted military personnel may not maintain a suit to recover damages from a superior officer for alleged constitutional violations, a holding that the District Court here described as an overbroad statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.083" offset="3617010">The courts below relied on this Court's statement in Chappell that military personnel are not barred from all redress in civilian courts for constitutional wrongs.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.708" offset="3663508">The courts obviously misread that statement, which was followed by citations to three cases that did not involve claims for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.397" offset="3698199">As at least three other Courts of Appeals have concluded, this Court in Chappell clearly held that servicemen may not pursue Bivens actions while indicating by the statement relied on by the courts below that in some cases they may grant other sorts of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.692" offset="3771446">We do not think that courts should frequently grant other sorts of relief to military personnel, but we acknowledge that this Court has left open that possibility in extreme cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.064" offset="3816899">Proceeding to their case by case inquiry, the courts below concluded that the concerns underlying Feres and Chappell are not relevant here because respondent was not ordered to take LSD.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.557" offset="3874891">While we do not think that any case by case inquiry is warranted, it is nevertheless clear that the courts below erred in reaching their conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.913" offset="3912299">The concerns underlying Feres are not limited to cases involving direct orders, and it is not clear where the District Court got its contrary idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.221" offset="3949497">This Court's decision in Feres nor this Court's decision in Shearer nor most of the Feres cases in between involved any sort of direct order.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.029" offset="3996726">This Court's made clear that the rule of Feres is based on the principle that the military is under the control of the political branches and that the judiciary should generally not review military decisions since such litigation would undermine military discipline and effectiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.206" offset="4069451">This Court's decision in Shearer is particularly instructive.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.525" offset="4086797">The Court there concluded that a claim against the Army based on its alleged failure to discharge or supervise a serviceman who had previously been convicted of manslaughter would require the courts to review a decision of command and would call into question basic choices about the supervision and control of servicemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.689" offset="4167463">It could not be more clear that this case involves such questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.807" offset="4183868">The heart of respondent's claim is that the Army should not have been using servicemen to study the effects of LSD and that it made a number of mistakes in the way it conducted those tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.965" offset="4228485">Respondent is therefore challenging decisions of command and calling into question basic decisions made by the Army in the 1950s concerning the use of military personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.423" offset="4270385">His claims are therefore barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.125" offset="4285118">If there are no further questions, I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1065.727" offset="4407580">The plaintiff did not volunteer for LSD drug testing nor was he under orders to arrive at Edgewood Arsenal for LSD drug testing, nor was he even on his regular duty status for that one-month period of time that he was up at Edgewood Arsenal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1388.987" offset="5700641">I should mention that up until the drug testing he was in the Army for about seven years and had an unblemished record in the Army, and he had intended to make the military his career.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.212" offset="5741497">It was not until seven years after he retired from military service, which is 18 years after the drug testing, that he finally got a letter from Walter Reed Medical Center telling him for the first time that he had been an unwitting LSD subject back in the late 1950s, and the purpose of that letter was to solicit him to go back up to Walter Reed now to do follow-up studies of the long-range effects of LSD.</text>

            <text syncTime="1523.959" offset="6240540">The CIA's own records about their involvement in drug testing programs in general back in the fifties were unfortunately destroyed back in 1973 pursuant to orders of the director of the CIA who is also a defendant in this lawsuit, and we have not been able to engage in discovery to any great extent in this case because the District Judge entered several orders protecting the government from discovery until we disposed of the Feres issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.776" offset="6347747">What we are asking at this point is the opportunity to go back to District Court and to prove the allegations that we are making in our complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.164" offset="6373347">It is our position that this case falls outside of the typical Feres factual paradigm is the phrase that was used by the Eleventh Circuit in this case, and that this is not the type of claim that would require the judicial involvement into a sensitive military issues at the expense of military discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.511" offset="6446699">The very worst fact that we have to deal with in this case is that this program, whoever implemented the program, occurred on an Army base, and there is no dispute about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.849" offset="6484106">Edgewood Arsenal is an Army base.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.600" offset="6491107">But this Court held in the Shearer case that the site of the incident is not nearly as important as whether the case, taking the case in a complete perspective, whether that case requires a civilian court to second guess the wisdom of military decisions, and this Court said that Feres today is best explained by the military discipline rationale, and that can't be reduced to just a few bright lines rules as to whether an incident occurred on an Army base or off of an Army case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.953" offset="6608449">Now, the lower courts in this case, both the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals, have held that this is clearly not just your garden variety Feres type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.676" offset="6647319">The facts of this case read like they have been lifted out of a novel by George Orwell where even a person's own creative thought process is tinkered with by the government, and altered, and controlled by the government, and we believe that the Constitution of the United States if it guarantees anything surely guarantees the right of all Americans to control their own mind and to control their own intellectual thought process and the content of their own bloodstream.</text>

            <text syncTime="2743.465" offset="11118542">We have no meaningful remedies provided in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2754.254" offset="11161696">In fact, that Act expressly recognizes the possibility of double recovery because there is a provision in the Veterans' Act which provides a method for offsetting cumulative recoveries, and this Court held in the Brooks case and the Brown case that a veteran who receives VA benefits is still not necessarily precluded from suing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.652" offset="11239228">One important point in conclusion also is that in a Bivens action defendants are always entitled to raise a qualified immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.007" offset="11272664">If they say they acted in good faith and if they reasonably believed their conduct to be lawful, just like in a civil rights case, then they are immune, but if this Court gives these defendants under these kind of facts an absolute immunity for the act that they have done, no matter... the message will be that no matter what a serviceman does to a lower echelon servicemen, they need never fear of being brought into the civil justice system, and I think that after all the progress that has been made since Bivens in the last 15 years with Bivens and Carlson versus Green and United States versus Muniz and so on, to recognize an absolute immunity from liability in an egregious case like this would be a step in the wrong direction, and we ask this Court to affirm the Eleventh Circuit's decision.</text>
