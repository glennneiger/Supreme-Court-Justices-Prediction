            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="153820">We will hear arguments first this morning in No. 84-6811, Warren McCleskey versus Ralph Kemp.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.153" offset="190391">Mr. Boger, you may proceed when you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_charles_boger" startTime="12.276" stopTime="396.893">
            <label>Mr. John Charles Boger</label>
            <text syncTime="12.276" offset="202826">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.838" offset="221111">If the State of Georgia had criminal statutes that expressly imposed different penalties, harsher penalties, on black defendants simply because they were black, or on those who killed white victims, simply because those victims were white, the statutes would plainly violate the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.298" offset="302927">There was a time, of course, when the State of Georgia did have such statutes, before our nation's Civil War, when free blacks and slaves alike could be given a death sentence merely for the crime of assault on a Georgia white citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.870" offset="357262">With the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, such criminal statutes came explicitly no longer to be written.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.962" offset="385578">Yet the old habits of mind, the racial attitudes of that time have survived, as this Court well knows, into the current century.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.270" offset="422881">Today, we are before the Court with a substantial body of evidence indicating that during the last decade Georgia prosecutors and juries, in their administration of Georgia's post-Furman capital statutes, have continued to act as if some of those old statutes were still on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.263" offset="506787">A black defendant convicted in the State of Georgia of the murder of a white person goes to his sentencing hearing with as serious a handicap against him on racial grounds alone as if the prosecutor had hard evidence that he had been tried and convicted previously of another murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.378" offset="583273">The color of a defendant's skin, in other words, or that of his victim, is often as grave an aggravating circumstance, in fact, in Georgia, as those expressly designated by Georgia's legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.889" offset="641369">We've documented below the role that's been played by racial considerations in Georgia's capital sentencing system.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.042" offset="669895">Our evidence demonstrates that Georgia sentences the killers of its white citizens at a rate nearly eleven times that to which it sentences to death the killers of its black citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.504" offset="723812">And even after most of the legitimate sentencing considerations had been taken into account, a defendant remains over four times likely to receive a capital sentence if his victim chanced to be white.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.343" offset="783162">Now the sources of petitioner's evidence below are two meticulous studies.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.356" offset="803224">They were conducted by Professors David Baldus and George Woodworth.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.136" offset="818271">And they have two major strengths that I think the Court should focus on at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.400" offset="839378">The first strength is their comprehensiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.383" offset="855260">They provide us with a thorough picture of how the Georgia capital sentencing system operated during the 1973-1979 period covered by the studies.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.112" offset="902176">The second feature of these studies is the extraordinary openness of Professors Baldus and Woodworth.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.953" offset="929552">Their indefatigable willingness to entertain every criticism, to test every rival hypothesis, to seize upon every statistical means known to them to take their racial findings and shake them hard and see if by some statistical means or method, those findings would drop out of their analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.632" offset="1016279">In other words, Professor Baldus was not wedded at the outset to any assumptions about what he wanted to prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.285" offset="1046894">He was open to all comers.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.222" offset="1054627">He was open to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.737" offset="1060687">He was open to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.941" offset="1065493">Indeed, during our evidentiary hearing in 1983, he invited the District Judge, please sir, you designate for us those factors you think make a difference in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.797" offset="1108961">You tell us a statistical method.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.296" offset="1118992">We will with our computer here run that model.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.795" offset="1132994">We will see whether in the test before the court we're right that race plays a part, or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.790" offset="1160893">The judge accepted that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.759" offset="1168834">The data were run under his model.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.382" offset="1179283">And indeed, the racial effects, as Judge Forester saw the system in Georgia, actually increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.537" offset="1203942">It's because Professor Baldus was wedded to no prior assumptions; it's because he subjected his statistical analysis to so many varieties of review; that his studies provide, I believe, such a powerful indictment of the Georgia system.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.875" offset="1273219">Now, one would suppose that the State of Georgia, faced with this serious challenge to the administration of its capital statutes, would have come forth with some explanation for these racial disparities.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.620" offset="1320240">That's the conventional pattern in these equal protection cases or Eighth Amendment cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.541" offset="1339884">Some legitimate reason that might demonstrate that what appear to be racial disparities, racial discrimination, actually is something more benign operating in the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.490" offset="1383769">But Georgia did not take this step, either in the year of discovery that preceded our 1983 hearing, or during that hearing itself, or even in the three years that this case has wended its way up on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.515" offset="1435805">The state certainly has not offered any rational state interest that would justify racial discrimination in itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.528" offset="1463913">But neither has the state offered any legitimate sentencing considerations that if taken into account would diminish the apparent role of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.369" offset="1499231">It has not come forward, as you suggested last term, in the Bazemore case, would be appropriate, with other statistical models to make race go away.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.976" offset="1533712">Instead, Georgia's sole response has been narrowly technical and methodological.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.286" offset="1558894">It has launched an attack on our data sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.393" offset="1571329">It has questioned the value of modern statistical analysis in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.548" offset="1587942">And it has sought a technical legal rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.109" offset="1602153">It has sought to obtain in this one area, the area of capital sentencing, a standard of proof so high that it has no peer anywhere else in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.261" offset="1638829">Now, its first attack on petitioner's data sources has a kind of a keen irony to it, because of course, as you know from the briefs, Professor Baldus and his colleagues drew their information from Georgia's own official files, from its police reports, from its prosecutors' statements, from its trial transcripts, from its records in the Supreme Court of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.566" offset="1723988">These are the very record that Georgia uses to prosecute capital cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1754.055" offset="7169996">Presented to the Court today are three central issues regarding the Georgia death penalty scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.380" offset="7191312">Initially, we're concerned with the question of the application of the statistical analysis, both in this case in particular, and in the death penalty context as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.175" offset="7230496">Secondly, were the standards to be applied in evaluating the Eighth Amendment claim has been raised, and whether an Eighth Amendment claim has actually been substantiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.515" offset="7263828">And thirdly, the question of an alleged equal protection violation; and whether that claim has also been substantiated by the facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.730" offset="7296638">To begin with, I would like to point out to the Court a few facts that I think are pertinent for consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.540" offset="7319939">In this case, we have a situation in which Mr. McCleskey's case was characterized by this study as a mid-range case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.287" offset="7350868">These are the facts which constitute a mid-range case under the study in question: a police officer killing, involved during an armed robbery, with co-perpetrators, in broad daylight, in a store in which approximately seven people were hostage, all of whom were forced to lie on the floor, many of whom were tied up during the commission of this crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.873" offset="7433311">We have two shots fired at the police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.122" offset="7446267">The first hit him in the eye; the fatal shot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.714" offset="7456612">The second shot fired happened to bounce off a cigarette lighter which was in his pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.617" offset="7480227">The testimony at trial indicated that would have been directly over his heart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.914" offset="7493392">And there was also some indication, and the prosecutor argued, that there was at least an inference that could be drawn, that the police officer was already on the floor at the time the second shot was fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.238" offset="7530695">There is no question that the person committing this act intended that the killing be done.</text>

            <text syncTime="1857.126" offset="7582313">What we have is a situation in which the evidence was presented to show that Mr. McCleskey had three prior convictions for armed robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.452" offset="7611570">He was also connected to two other robberies during the course of the trial, one of which involved the stealing of the weapon which was identified, as being the murder weapon in this case; a second of which related to the arrest which led up to his confession or statements in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.256" offset="7674787">We also have the testimony of two victims from the furniture store robbery who identified Mr. McCleskey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.161" offset="7698401">We have the testimony of Mr. McCleskey's co-perpetrator, who places Mr. McCleskey as the only one of the four participants in the area of the store who could have fired the fatal shots.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.313" offset="7739048">And we finally have the testimony of another inmate who heard Mr. McCleskey bragging about the killing, and even stating to the effect that if 12 more police officers had come in, he would have done the same thing and shot his way out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.917" offset="7797458">These are facts that under this study constitute a mid-range case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.414" offset="7819400">Based on those factors alone, we would submit that the study itself certainly causes great questions to be raised about its validity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1971.803" offset="8041023">Those two facts alone don't make these cases factually similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.239" offset="8058682">As I've noted, all of the previous other facts which serve to make this case that much more aggravated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.956" offset="8081565">The mid-range case, and the mid-range analysis done in this case, does not compare factually similar cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.514" offset="8111867">And a reading of the testimony indicates, this is simply an aggravation level, using regression analyses, that comes up with a weight to be attached to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.057" offset="8150006">There is no way of knowing whether the cases in this so-called mid-range are factually similar at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.383" offset="8175293">As a matter of fact, it was never even asserted that they were factually similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.788" offset="8188876">It was simply asserted that once the regression analysis was conducted, based on one particular regression, that the aggravation level, if you will, that was derived from that regression was similar for these cases; no indication as to whether they had similar aggravating circumstances; similar mitigating circumstances; or anything of this sort.</text>
