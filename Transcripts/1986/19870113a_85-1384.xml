            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="156425">We will hear argument first this morning in No. 85-1384, William R. Turner v. Leonard Safley.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.289" offset="197489">Mr. Herschel, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="henry_thomas_herschel" startTime="13.891" stopTime="500.170">
            <label>Mr. Henry Thomas Herschel</label>
            <text syncTime="13.891" offset="211909">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.026" offset="224448">Initially, I'm going to go through a brief background of the case and the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.263" offset="249421">I will then proceed to the correspondence issue, and then discuss the marriage issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.333" offset="269692">At present, unless there's questions concerning the findings of facts and conclusions of law, I'll leave those for the argument on the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.606" offset="298845">The issue in this case is prisons; specifically, about the level of deference that is going to be given to prison officials to act upon... to act upon legitimate security... their legitimate security interests concerning the regulation of inmate-to-inmate correspondence and inmate marriages.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.801" offset="375540">This is a class action that was brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1983, which challenged the Missouri Department of Corrections regulations that... regulations concerning the inmate-to-inmate correspondence and inmate marriage problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.410" offset="434054">The District Court and... the District Court found that those regulations were far more restrictive than necessary... for necessariness, and held them unconstitutional--</text>
            <text syncTime="78.949" offset="472193">This holding was affirmed by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.484" offset="490270">The visit... the challenges to the Missouri visitation regulation, and a damage issue, were found in favor of the defendants, and were not appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.674" offset="527050">The Renz Correctional Center is a complex prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.776" offset="539485">What I mean to... what I mean to say when I say a complex prison is that it's a co-correctional, multilevel security institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.065" offset="572608">At the Renz Correctional Center, at the time of this trial, we had male and female inmates; we had female maximum security inmates and medium security inmates; and male minimum security inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.138" offset="624957">The... the Renz Correctional Center was also used to hide inmates within the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.942" offset="648154">For example, if somebody was concerned about their life or something along those lines, the Renz Center would be used to hide them, because the minimum security men were located there.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.715" offset="687233">At the present time, we have undergone some changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.536" offset="702489">The Renz Correctional Center medium security women have been moved to another institution, along with a number of the maximum security.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.456" offset="734149">Eventually there will be a maximum security unit for women at another location, and we will move the rest of the women who are now housed at Renz to that institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.247" offset="777408">However, Renz will always be a place where we will have some women for medical care and for special security problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.186" offset="813143">But they'll never have the number of women that it had at the time of this trial, which was approximately 250.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.507" offset="838430">The regulations at issue are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.411" offset="857969">The correspondence issue in effect at the... at that time did not permit correspondence between inmates in different institutions, whether it was in-state or out-of-state, unless the adjustment classification team, which was a team of case workers who reviewed their files before they permitted anyone to correspond, to correspond with any other inmate in another institution, unless it was in their best interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.876" offset="963922">In addition, they were permitted to correspond with relatives who are also incarcerated within... within the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.315" offset="997672">The marriage regulation did not prohibit... did not permit the marriage of... the marriage of inmates unless the superintendent determined there was a compelling reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.356" offset="1041767">In other words, the burden was on the inmate to come forward to the superintendent and present him with a compelling reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.010" offset="1072383">The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals... and I believe the evidence would sustain that... is that basically it was a rather narrow interpretation; it was only going to be on the basis that there was a child involved, or through a previous relationship before they were incarcerated that the prison official or the superintendent would permit the marriage while it was... while they were in... in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.177" offset="1181052">The appellant... the appellants in this case request... or the petitioner in this case requests the court permit deference to the prison officials, and that the court require that inmates prove that the prison officials have exaggerated their response to the penological interest before they determine that the regulation is overbroad or that it's unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.275" offset="1273525">The respondents, on the other hand, would burden the prison official to demonstrate a pattern of security concerns before the regulation could be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.648" offset="1310933">Then there would be a determination of whether the exercise of the right involved, the inmate exercise, is in someway inherently dangerous, or presumptively dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.189" offset="1349176">And then the court would pick between competing reasonable alternatives, or least restrictive alternatives, to determine which alternative achieved this goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.878" offset="1391912">There is no debate, even... I don't believe there's any debate among the parties... that even a core right that the respondents have argued deserves a strict scrutiny, can be restricted in some manner by the fact of incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.923" offset="1456069">The question is, to what extent can we restrict the rights of inmates while they are incarcerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.743" offset="1479370">This Court, in previous First Amendment cases and prison cases, has used an analysis... I'm using, to be precise, Procunier v. Martinez... has used an analysis which presented the least restrictive alternative... which presented the rational relation test.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.122" offset="1552827">By this examination, the Court required that the decision of the correctional official be demonstrated to be an exaggeration, an exaggerated response to a legitimate penological interest demonstrated by substantial evidence on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.766" offset="1631403">In determining whether the response has been exaggerated, this Court has examined a number of... a number of factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.022" offset="1660451">They first examined... identified the penological interest involved, whether it was a security interest, rehabilitation of inmates, whether it was deterrence of crime or the maintenance of internal order, the Court would always identify.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.914" offset="1712069">In the present case, the petitioners presented the... the security interest as the predominant interest in upholding of the... in the upholding of our regulation between inmate-and-inmate correspondence.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.743" offset="1787302">We also had some rehabilitation interest, but predominantly it was a security interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.295" offset="1805587">We decided that this was an important issue, because we feel that the control of communication between inmates in institutions is critical to our control of not only inmate... inmate violence, but inmate gang control and various other... various other security interests that we would have in isolating inmates between institutions in Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.477" offset="1898270">For example, in Missouri, we do have 13 institutions, and we have the ability to move them around.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.298" offset="1917601">The second interest, and the most interest that this Court has examined, is whether the... the regulation itself was content-neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.987" offset="1952291">And in the present case, this regulation is content-neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.539" offset="1966502">Once the regulation is approved... once the inmate is approved, and this was a prior approval, the inmate was then permitted to correspond.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.045" offset="2000565">We did not in any way censor any of his correspondence, or in any way try to... try to confine him to what he could write about the institution in anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.934" offset="2044138">Finally, the regulation that Court has always... has examined as a relevant factor, whether alternative means of communication between... alternative ways of achieving the communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.343" offset="2097741">In this present situation, as to that individual inmate, if an inmate is prohibited from corresponding with another inmate, there will be no alternative means of communicating with that particular inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.235" offset="2145284">However, there will be alternative means of communication.</text>

            <text syncTime="2847.290" offset="11545499">But in Jones, there was a specific discussion of the First Amendment rights to inmates to solicit one another for membership in a prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.229" offset="11581339">And what this Court said was, we're not going... we don't have... the State... excuse me, the prison officials do not have to allow mass mailings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.817" offset="11611641">But the Court recognized that's because there can still be individual mailings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.387" offset="11633898">That channel of communication is not cut off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.073" offset="11644660">And we view that as authority for the position we're arguing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.357" offset="11661796">When Leonard Safley, one of the named plaintiffs, wanted to write a letter to his fiancee, P.J. Watson, it didn't do any good to tell him he might be able to write to somebody else, because he had a particular target of that correspondence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.034" offset="11712474">And Jones recognizes that that existence of no other alternative is what's important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.388" offset="11741940">The Court did use a least restrictive analysis in Jones as regards to the First Amendment issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.675" offset="11767122">And I'd also point out that the Court said, First Amendment rights are barely at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.631" offset="11794916">Well, back in Pell, this Court held that the inmates do have some First Amendment rights which are not inconsistent with incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.219" offset="11829294">And the State's conceded that they let at least 25 percent of the inmates write.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.021" offset="11844445">So it's clear that the mere fact of correspondence is not inconsistent with incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.492" offset="11866387">It's what in the letter itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.309" offset="11873597">And the only way you determine what's in the letter is by reading it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3631.993" offset="14684373">Leonard Safley, one of the plaintiffs in this case, was in the Kansas City honor center, and had the opportunity to come down and visit his wife in Renz Correctional Center, and he did that on a regular basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.586" offset="14734737">Now, admittedly, their marriage at that time may have been limited to letters, sitting together in the visiting room, and holding hands and an occasional kiss when the guard wasn't looking, but that does not mean that that marriage was any less important or sacred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.845" offset="14791788">There are many people who marry, perhaps in their 60's or 70's, who may not have a sexual relationship, but still have care for the person that they've chosen to spend the rest of their life with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.653" offset="14839018">And it may be, as the District Court recognized, that these marriages may not all work out.</text>

            <text syncTime="3689.965" offset="14916236">We had expert testimony that the important thing about the marriage decision is that the inmate is standing up and saying, hey, while I may be incarcerated, I've got a right to look forward to a better life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.422" offset="14962107">I've got a right to plan on something after this institution.</text>

            <text syncTime="3767.465" offset="15226257">Even when he was gone, however, they wouldn't let the two inmates correspond.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.936" offset="15248095">And so Mr. Safley didn't now until he came to Judge Sacks' courtroom about... in 1982... whether she would actually consent to marry him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.326" offset="15289682">And that's when, in the courtroom, is when we found out her answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3788.212" offset="15309222">I think that the prison administration in the State of Missouri can balance the interests of the inmates in correspondence and marriage with their own security needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.122" offset="15368885">As I've suggested, they have been able to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="3808.026" offset="15388529">But if this Court takes away that prodding by granting too much deference to prison administrators, then we're going to have a series of cases, I would suggest, around the country where--</text>
