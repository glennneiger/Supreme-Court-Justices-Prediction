            <text syncTime="1.316" offset="149052">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1.649" offset="150411">At issue in this case is the standard for municipal liability under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="4.099" offset="160128">The facts center on the fatal shooting of a fugitive who had abducted a woman, who had avoided police at two roadblocks during a chase through the streets of the City of Springfield.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.957" offset="207567">There are three reasons why the First Circuit's opinion... decision should be reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.312" offset="233062">First, there is no unconstitutional policy in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.180" offset="248527">Second, gross negligence is an insufficient standard of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.168" offset="268484">And third, the evidence is insufficient to support the jury verdict against the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.786" offset="290950">With regard to the first reason, since Monell interpreted Section 1983 to impose policy based municipal liability, an unconstitutional policy has been prevalent in cases where this Court has approve municipal liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.085" offset="376109">The First Circuit has expanded municipal liability beyond the limits of this Court's decision by imposing liability without the requirement of an unconstitutional policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.209" offset="424592">The explicit requirement of an unconstitutional policy would draw a line which determines causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.482" offset="465657">For example, when a municipal employee acts pursuant to an unconstitutional policy, a constitutional deprivation results, and the city would be responsible for that deprivation.</text>

            <text syncTime="176.228" offset="848716">Now there's no written policy that says, it's okay not to feed the prisoners.</text>

            <text syncTime="191.488" offset="909738">But in terms of whether the Constitution imposes affirmative obligations upon a city, I don't believe that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.130" offset="960311">It's our position that the Constitution is a charter of prohibitions, which... which states that the city should not permit its officers, or instruct them, to violate the Constitution, or instruct them in conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="2000.166" offset="8144403">And what Mr. Pikula said regarding the question... I believe it was from Mr. Marshall, from Mr. Justice Marshall, and Justice Stevens also asked, regarding the effect of no training.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.474" offset="8197692">And his answer was to the effect that the inquiry seems to collapse into one of causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.913" offset="8227472">In other words, if there's no training at all, and it causes a constitutional violation, then why do we need to bifurcate the inquiry into whether the policy itself is unconstitutional or the resulting activity of the police is unconstitutional, when the statute itself, as interpreted by Monell, says that if A causes B to inflict a tort on C, then B's tort becomes A's tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.099" offset="8344187">I mean, that language is right in Monell, and it comes right from the statute, which says that any person who causes... who subjects or causes to be subjected to a constitutional violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2093.609" offset="8518163">And if you take that part of the restatement of agency... or general agency law that holds that a principal is responsible for the torts that occur due to his negligent training, supervision or selection of agents, then you're back to the language of the statute again directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.005" offset="8603844">Because that is talking about causation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2150.846" offset="8747204">As to the question of gross negligence, while we're on the subject of the language of the statute and Monell, I would also just invite your attention to the fact that if you should choose to reach the question of what level of culpability, what the mental state has to be under Section 1983, there's no reason to go beyond simple negligence, Davidson and Daniels notwithstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.596" offset="8850127">Those cases weren't dealing with municipal liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.865" offset="8863188">Those were dealing with the simple negligence of public officials or government officials dealing directly with the person injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.471" offset="8901640">But the language of Section 6 is worth another look.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.042" offset="8919926">That is the language, of course, which in Justice Brennan's opinion in Monell was central, it was the lynchpin to the argument about respondeat superior.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.182" offset="8964543">And footnote 57 of that case says: We look to the language of Section 6 to find the contours of municipal liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="2440.002" offset="9903802">The fact is that every circuit that has considered the question has found that failure to train is a basis of claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.472" offset="9929715">And the majority of them have found gross negligence to be a sufficient basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.559" offset="9949986">But to get back to the language of the statute if I may just for a moment, Section 6 is... of the statute, which is now 42 U.S.C. 1986, is written now in the language of simple negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.069" offset="10016024">That's the statute which imposes liability on anyone having power to prevent constitutional deprivations, who neglects or refuses to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.377" offset="10061268">And the measure of damages there is the damages which reasonable diligence could have prevented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.633" offset="10090316">Now that seems to be the language of simple negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.250" offset="10104736">If the Court is going to impose gross negligence, I think it will have to do it outside that part of the statutory history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.058" offset="10147995">The... there is also statutory history in the Congressional Globe, which is cited in the brief of one of the amicus curiae, regarding the fact that this statute will impose liability for the defaults of the municipality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.037" offset="10227929">Again, language of simple negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.472" offset="10237647">So there's really no reason to go beyond a gross negligence standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.542" offset="10257918">Finally, I would just like to come back again to the Tuttle issue, or the Tuttle nonissue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.100" offset="10304207">The basis of the decision in Tuttle seemed to be that the single incident of outrageous brutality on the part of the police officers was not a logical basis on which an inference of failure to train could be drawn, that single thing... that single shooting, because you could just as easily infer that the man who did the shooting was deranged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.418" offset="10409428">"One bad apple", was the phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.151" offset="10416429">In this case, you have three shootings in three separate places, the third one being presumably the fatal bullet, followed by a beating inside the man's car, which was justified again on the basis that he had failed to surrender.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.498" offset="10489781">He was unconscious and therefore he had failed to surrender, and there's an officer who testifies to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.116" offset="10512246">Another beating when he was pulled from the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.818" offset="10523008">And then man is transported to the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.639" offset="10538368">And whoever fired the fatal shot withholds the information that the man has been shot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.524" offset="10557908">And we know that Theodore Perry has shot him from eight feet away... and ballistics shows that it's his bullet... couldn't have not known that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.029" offset="10587897">The inference that arises from that kind of a broad sampling is different, by far, than one bad apple kind of analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.635" offset="10630319">We're talking about a whole collection of people who've engaged in this conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.473" offset="10649650">And on top of that, we have testimony that these men have not been trained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.210" offset="10672638">Now, there were some questions about, whether no training at all can be a basis for liability.</text>
