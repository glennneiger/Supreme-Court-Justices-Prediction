            <text syncTime="15.176" offset="209818">Mr. Habicht, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. F. Henry Habicht, II</label>
            <text syncTime="19.728" offset="228104">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case concerns the Ninth Circuit's entry of a preliminary injunction against oil and gas exploration activities in two areas of the outer continental shelf lying between 25 and 350 miles from the coast of Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.856" offset="300620">The Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court's denial of a preliminary injunction here.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.593" offset="323503">The Court of Appeals did not overrule the express District Court findings of no irreparable harm, and that the balance of harms counseled against entry of a preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.301" offset="366344">Rather, the Ninth Circuit ruled that these findings did not, in the words of the Court,</text>
            <text syncTime="59.205" offset="385988">"excuse the District Court's duty to enter an injunction. "</text>
            <text syncTime="63.256" offset="402184">Based upon the Ninth Circuit rule that absent unusual circumstances an injunction must issue when the Court finds a procedural violation of an environmental or a conservation statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.214" offset="454011">The environmental statute said to be violated here is Section 810 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, or ANILCA, which provides for a consideration of impacts on subsistence activities in certain federal decisions concerning the use of public lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.545" offset="527363">The Ninth Circuit ruled that even though the Secretary of Interior had analyzed subsistence impacts at length in the environmental impact statement for these lease sales, Section 810 of ANILCA, which by its terms applies to public lands in Alaska, requires the Secretary separately to comply with that provision before leasing outer continental shelf tracts lying as much as 350 miles offshore.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.843" offset="628509">Today we will argue two points developed in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.862" offset="644600">First, that the Ninth Circuit rule automatically requiring injunctions for certain statutory violations is without basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.301" offset="678350">Second, that in ANILCA Congress never intended the terms "public lands in Alaska" to govern activities on the outer continental shelf.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="141.942" offset="716907">Mr. Habicht, are you going to at some time in your argument get to the geographical location of these lands?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="f_henry_habicht_ii" startTime="148.612" stopTime="610.430">
            <label>Mr. F. Henry Habicht, II</label>
            <text syncTime="148.612" offset="743656">These lands... I would be happy to, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.214" offset="757972">These lands are located in the Bering Sea southwest of Nome, Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.202" offset="777929">The Norton Basin area, which is Sale 57, lies about 25 miles from the coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.956" offset="804992">The Navarin Basin, which is the area covered by Sale 83 in this case, lies as much as 350 miles from the coast of Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.545" offset="839369">It is due west, at the western end of the Bering Sea, lying adjacent to the border with the Soviet Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.734" offset="872074">Even assuming that Section 810 applies to these leased sales, the Ninth Circuit requirement of a preliminary injunction here is flatly contrary to this Court's decision in Weinberger versus Romaro Barcelo, which we submit is controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.993" offset="933096">This Court in Weinberger thoroughly reviewed the history and the principles of equity jurisprudence, and said clearly that while violations of the law will not be ignored, the extraordinary remedy of an injunction requires a particularized inquiry into the circumstances of each case, including at a minimum a finding of irreparable harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.824" offset="1016479">The Ninth Circuit rejected the Weinberger inquiry here and the District Court's express findings in favor of a generalized rule that a procedural violation of an environmental statute alone can warrant injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.866" offset="1072590">This notion of a duty to enter an injunction without findings of irreparable harm on its face conflicts with the decision of this Court in Weinberger.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.189" offset="1109893">And there are no alternative grounds for sustaining the Ninth Circuit decision here.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.176" offset="1129851">Given the teaching of Weinberger and a host of other decisions of this Court concerning equity Jurisprudence, the District Court's findings here can only be reversed on one of two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.699" offset="1171960">First, that it was an abuse of discretion which is the traditional standard of review of a denial of a preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.353" offset="1198605">Or, second, that Congress removed, clearly removed the District Court's discretion, In this case in ANILCA by specifically requiring injunctive relief in all cases without regard to the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.529" offset="1255238">First, there can be no finding of an abuse of discretion on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.599" offset="1271539">The Ninth Circuit did not overrule the express findings of the District Court concerning irreparable harm or balance of harms.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.920" offset="1296825">It simply ruled that these findings were irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.055" offset="1309364">Second, the Ninth Circuit said that Weinberger was Inapplicable and therefore did not attempt to determine as Weinberger dictates whether in Section 810 Congress specifically intended to curtail District Court discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.799" offset="1368401">Here there is no express language that has been cited nor legislative history to support that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.218" offset="1394001">In fact, in the Senate report to ANILCA which served as the conference reports, cited in our brief at Page 23, the report says that a proposed action may proceed even in the face of findings of potential harm to subsistence resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.747" offset="1460143">This kind of language hardly meets this Court's requirement of either express intent, express statements, or a necessary and inescapable inference that Congress intended to withdraw traditional equitable discretion from the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.757" offset="1520225">This language and the context of Section 810 is strikingly similar to that of the Clean Water Act reviewed by this Court in Weinberger.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.362" offset="1558572">The Clean Water Act also in quite mandatory terms prohibited the discharge of pollutants without a permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.433" offset="1586889">The Court in Weinberger ruled that an injunction was not required based upon findings of no irreparable harm to water quality in that case and that the compliance proposals were fully consistent with the goals of the Clean Water Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.193" offset="1637985">This is precisely such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.745" offset="1652091">Respondents have argued that TVA versus Hill requires a different result here.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.965" offset="1672989">But in fact this Court in TVA versus Hill engaged in precisely the sort of inquiry outlined in Weinberger.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.952" offset="1697021">The Court expressly found that there would be... that a critical habitat of the small guider, an endangered species in that case, would be destroyed by the closing of the Teleco Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.508" offset="1739235">Secondly, the Court ruled at Page 193 of 437 United States Reports, that the finding that the very object of the substantive protections of the Endangered Species Act was going to be extirpated in the words of the Court, didn't necessarily dictate the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.453" offset="1811020">The Court then engaged in an inquiry into the legislative history of the Endangered Species Act and other evidence of Congressional intent to find that Congress explicitly, beyond doubt in the words of the Court, struck the balance in that case in favor of saving this endangered species which was in fact going to be extirpated.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.683" offset="1891895">Here, as we have already noted, the District Court found that there would be no harm from exploration activities to subsistence resources in the outer continental shelf off Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.257" offset="1938184">Finally, the factual and statutory context here demonstrates why it is important to examine all the elements in the traditional preliminary injunction test.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.847" offset="1972561">The fact, for example, the fact that this action is proceeding under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978 is not irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.036" offset="2005266">First of all, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments bear on the determination of the public interest in an equitable proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.189" offset="2033896">As this Court recognized in Secretary of Interior versus California, Congress intended to promote the expedited exploration of the resources of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, the United States Outer Continental Shelf of which two-thirds lies offshore Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.453" offset="2118951">Second, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act bears directly on the remedial calculus here, because as this Court also recognized in Secretary of Interior versus California, Congress explicitly segmented the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act process into discrete stages so that information about resources on the Outer Continental Shelf could be developed without undue risk to environmental or human resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.503" offset="2223127">Congress made clear that development may never occur on the Outer Continental Shelf without a separate approval and separate environmental analysis before any development plans are approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.561" offset="2263356">Therefore this structure is indeed directly relevant to determining the necessity and the appropriate scope of an equitable remedy in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.084" offset="2305465">The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, is not dispositive with regard to the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.488" offset="2327095">The proper relief in a given case is going to depend on the nature of the harm and the facts and the circumstances before the District Court, Here, as we have noted, subsistence evaluations were made by the Secretary both before the lease sales and then under Section 810 after each of the lease sales here.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.116" offset="2397625">The District Court expressly found no harm to subsistence resources from the exploration stage, and also noted that production and development could not occur until there would be further environmental review and further approvals, and also noted that under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act the Secretary of the Interior has the authority to shape and control the outer continental shelf leasing process, including cancelling leases if significant harm to the environment or social harm is presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.135" offset="2517684">Given all of these circumstances and the ample protection for subsistence here the goals, the statutory goals of Congress in Section 810 of ANILCA can be met without shutting down the lease sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.693" offset="2571914">Turning to the second point, turning to the second major area of the Ninth Circuit--</text>

            <text syncTime="656.491" offset="2775147">In that case the Court found in favor of the Secretary on the NEPA issue and then proceeded to note that the preliminary injunction in any event, even if NEPA had applied in those circumstances, would have been inappropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1250.687" offset="5151872">It is important to understand ANILCA's role in the entire scheme of things within Alaska land legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.941" offset="5180920">There are three key Acts, the Statehood Act of 1958, the 1971 Claims Settlement Act, and then ANILCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.297" offset="5214357">All three use the term "public lands".</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.166" offset="5229821">In all three it is absolutely clear that that term pertains exclusively to lands within Alaska and cannot extend to the OCS.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.206" offset="5274021">The Statehood Act gave Alaska the right to select about 100 million acres of public lands in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.544" offset="5299307">It has always been recognized that those lands selected by the states had to be exclusively on shore lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.514" offset="5323235">The '71 Claims Settlement Act dealt with complications that arose in the course of Alaska's selection of its lands arising from native claims and arising from conservationist concerns to preserve certain federal lands and parks and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.624" offset="5379660">That was done in Section 17(d)(2) of the Claims Settlement Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.243" offset="5398154">That Act directed the United States to withdraw 80 million acres of public lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.129" offset="5417694">It also gave the state and the natives a right to select from the public lands lands in satisfaction of the state's Statehood Act rights and lands in satisfaction of the native claims rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.954" offset="5468998">Again, it is perfectly clear that public lands there did not extend to the OCS.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.589" offset="5487493">ANILCA completed that process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.208" offset="5497942">It put about 120 million acres of public lands, again, lands within the state, in parks, refuges, and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.880" offset="5532633">It did that in Titles 2 through 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.349" offset="5546530">It is perfectly clear those public lands are lands within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.784" offset="5560323">It is also clear that whenever that phrase was used in other provisions of the statute it pertained exclusively to lands within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.223" offset="5594073">For example, Section 906 of the statute, which is 43 USC 1635(b), extends the state's land selection rights to public lands for an additional ten years, and it also gives the state of Alaska 75,000 acres of additional lands, again, public lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.653" offset="5679754">Perfectly clear these public lands are lands within the state, not the OCS.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.041" offset="5697309">Title 8, the subsistence provision, uses the same term "public lands".</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.645" offset="5723745">The subsistence protection of the statute pertains exclusively to public lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.181" offset="5741926">The legislative history was very clear that what the natives wanted was extension of subsistence protection, not just to those 120 million acres of lands within parks and refuges but also to all remaining public lands in Alaska, on shore lands, not the OCS.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.976" offset="5821025">The specific definition formulated by Congress regarding the meaning of public lands reinforces the natural conclusions that one draws when one understands ANILCA's role in the legislative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.653" offset="5871807">Public lands are lands situated in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.522" offset="5883301">They are lands to which the United States asserts title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.723" offset="5896048">The OCS qualifies under neither score.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.375" offset="5910677">Now, the respondent's entire argument really in this case is that because under Section 4(b) of the Claims Settlement Act their claims to lands on the OCS were extinguished, then the subsistence provisions should read in pari materia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.339" offset="5994478">They, too, they say, should be extended to the OCS.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.974" offset="6009106">That argument misunderstands and overlooks obvious and decisive dissimilarities between the two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.747" offset="6044110">First, the Native Claims Settlement Act when it extinguished lands did not limit its application to public lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.752" offset="6076189">It extinguished the native claims to all lands, whether state-owned, federally owned, or privately held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.156" offset="6097818">The term 4(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.108" offset="6113596">Second, that statute was specifically written... by that statute I mean Section 4(b) of the Claims Settlement Act, specifically included submerged lands underneath all water areas, both inland and offshore, and that specific reference in the statute was in response to testimony offered to Congress during the Claims Settlement Act which said we should extinguish offshore claims as well as onshore claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.009" offset="6221221">ANILCA, by sharp contrast, has nothing in it whatever on its face or in its legislative history that suggests in any way that it should extend to the OCS.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.999" offset="6265106">There is no need or no point in remanding this case to the Ninth Circuit for further consideration in the light of this Court's proper construction of Section 810.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.005" offset="6305230">This Court can in this case render a construction of Section 810 of ANILCA that makes it perfectly clear that while it extends only to lands in Alaska, as the statute indicates, there is every reason to believe the other statute might extend elsewhere.</text>

            <text syncTime="1592.806" offset="6520375">They say that this was Indian law and should be liberally construed in their favor, the subsistence provision of ANILCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.578" offset="6555483">Well, it is Indian law in a sense, but it is Indian law in a special sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.364" offset="6570634">Section 810 is only one section in a massive statute that uses the same term, "public lands", throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.136" offset="6597697">You can't adopt an expansive construction of it for Title 8 and wreak havoc throughout the rest of the statute by a principle of resolving ambiguities in favor of native Americans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.492" offset="6635105">Secondly, that principle only takes you so far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.028" offset="6649315">It cannot take you to the point of overlooking the plain language and clear legislative history of the statute as you would have to do to adopt their reading of the statute here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.549" offset="6683379">Finally, they argue that ANILCA is a general subsistence protection measure, and it should be liberally construed to protect them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.203" offset="6710024">It is not a general subsistence protection measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.739" offset="6720159">It is a very special statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.524" offset="6727265">It is limited to the disposition of federal public lands in Alaska, and that is all it applies to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.178" offset="6749834">There are other statutes that protect subsistence on the OCS as elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.380" offset="6762687">NEPA protects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.447" offset="6766971">The Endangered Species Act protects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.432" offset="6774912">All those statutes were complied with in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.284" offset="6786301">No one has argued to the contrary in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.701" offset="6795914">So the general subsistence protection is provided elsewhere, not in ANILCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.355" offset="6810543">We will rest on the arguments that we have regarding the Ninth Circuit's two other mistakes pertaining to ANILCA by virtue of what we have said in our briefs, because if the Court agrees with us on the basic question of ANILCA's application to the OCS it need not reach those questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1688.720" offset="6904061">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the facts which give rise to this case concern the use of ice areas which lie off the coast of Alaska by Alaskan natives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.396" offset="6970726">Obviously, in most areas of the world, you know, water is water and land is land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.967" offset="6992982">Because of the arctic conditions Alaskan natives have traditionally ranged far out in the ice areas off the coast to do their hunting and fishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.774" offset="7036241">They have set up camps on the ice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.809" offset="7048362">They have built roads on the ice and engaged in those kinds of activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.445" offset="7066961">Because we have these unusual or somewhat unusual circumstances it sort of gives rise to what you have identified at least preliminarily here as a basic issue in the case, and that is whether various statutes which can affect the hunting and fishing rights of Alaskan natives in fact apply to these ice areas lying off the coast of Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.377" offset="7158703">The first statute is the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, and that statute was passed in 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.749" offset="7192140">It was passed for the purpose of extinguishing native claims to the interior regions of Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.053" offset="7217426">After oil was discovered in Alaska the oil industry needed to extinguish native claims so that they could build a pipeline through basically the interior areas of Alaska and then into the water ice-free ports so that they could then transport the oil to the lower 48.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.884" offset="7300705">The focus of the Claims Settlement Act, it was always considered to be a land claims settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.538" offset="7327350">The outer continental shelf is not mentioned in that statute, and really, given the history and the context it is unsurprising that that wasn't didn't come up, since the issue really was, they needed to extinguish the claims in the interior so that they could build the pipeline into the port of Valdez.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.951" offset="7401015">As a consequence, as you look at the Claims Settlement Act, it does not seem to affect the outer continental shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.307" offset="7438422">The statute uses the terms 16 OSC 3102, and that defines public lands as all federal lands and interests therein located in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.099" offset="7501534">Just from the plain language it would not seem that the Claims Settlement Act was intended to apply to areas lying outside the territorial boundaries of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.474" offset="7543016">It simply says in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.207" offset="7550017">That plain language is also outtressed by the legislative history of the Claims Settlement Act, and the legislative history indicates constant references both in committee reports and by testimony that says that this Claims Act is supposed to apply to the lands comprising the state of Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.288" offset="7626295">There are some references that say specifically that this Act applies to 375 million acres of land in Alaska, and 375 million acres are the interior land areas, the offshore areas, and the submerged lands in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.249" offset="7694109">It does not include the outer continental shelf.</text>

            <text syncTime="1899.973" offset="7749070">This case is here on an appeal not from a final judgment but from the grant of a preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.127" offset="7773625">If this Court were to construe the Conservation Act and the Claims Settlement Act and find that the plain language suggested that neither applied to the outer continental shelf, then remanded to the Court of Appeals, obviously the Court of Appeals, following the remand, would be free to reconsider its decision concerning the extinguishment of aboriginal title.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald S. Cooper</label>
            <text syncTime="1936.682" offset="7895878">Well, alternatively, what we would suggest is that it that... what I would say is that all the arguments concerning the geographic scope of the Claims Settlement Act have already been presented to the Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.490" offset="7943108">The oil companies and the government have argued that they have relied heavily on the Claims Settlement Act as suggesting that their position that the Acts are totally different, and we have relied on it heavily to show that the Acts have to be construed consistently, and I am not... if you did grant the cross-petition and entertain arguments I don't think that those arguments would differ from what you already have before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.073" offset="8057420">And given that the case is here on a request for certiorari from a grant of preliminary injunction, the Court of Appeals would be free to go back and to reconsider its decision with respect to the geographic application of the Claims Settlement Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.019" offset="8121263">When we get to the Conservation Act, I mean, the Conservation Act was passed about ten years after the Claims Settlement Act, and it has a somewhat different purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.326" offset="8174448">It is... what happened was, of course, that as part of the agreement which produced the Claims Settlement Act Congress chose not to place statutory protections for subsistence hunting and fishing rights in the Claims Settlement Act, but it did tell Alaska natives that it would protect those uses by directing interior to take all measures necessary to protect them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.727" offset="8280087">And in fact, in the final committee report which dropped out the subsistence protections there was an explicit direction both to the Secretary and to the state of Alaska that they should act to protect these uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.784" offset="8328257">The protections for subsistence hunting and fishing did materialize.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.205" offset="8349991">When Congress came back in 1980 and passed the Conservation Act it first included a small section which would nave protected the subsistence hunting and fishing rights on the conservation units, the (d)(2) lands which were created by the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.483" offset="8419059">Alaska natives came back and said that is not sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.435" offset="8434941">I mean, what has happened is, you have extinguished aboriginal title to land and interests in Alaska, and we basically want these statutory protections to be congruent with those, with that extinguishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.277" offset="8486246">And the Alaska natives' proposal went directly to the Claims Settlement Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.146" offset="8505785">The Conservation Act in their proposed definition uses the term "public lands", and it defines public lands as federal lands, waters, and interests therein situated in Alaska, so the term "public lands" in the Claims Settlement Act is defined as federal lands and interests therein located in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.059" offset="8589377">The term in the Conservation Act is federal lands, waters, and interests therein situated in Alaska, and I suggest to you that other than the fact that in the Conservation Act you add the term "waters" and it is located instead of situated, I mean, those terms are identical in the two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.521" offset="8659281">Interior basically urges this Court to accept its position, which is, those two phrases should be construed totally inconsistently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.995" offset="8709123">When they get to the Claims Settlement Act, they suggest that it is ambiguous, that the term "in Alaska", that if you say</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.983" offset="8737126">"in Alaska, including submerged lands. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.268" offset="8750187">Which of course would have referred to the oil port facilities which are, which the pipeline runs through submerged lands of the Port of Valdiz, that you should construe that broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.075" offset="8793446">You should construe the term "in Alaska" as extending out to the outer continental shelf, and then when they get to the Conservation Act they want this Court to take the totally opposite viewpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.150" offset="8845795">They want to have that construed as narrowly as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.018" offset="8861260">They say that the term "in Alaska" is clear and unambiguous, and that it doesn't include the outer continental shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.606" offset="8887591">Our position in this case has been that you actually can't do that, that obviously the two statutes are historically intertwined, that they are very linked, anti that whatever construction that you want to give to one you really have to give to the other, and there really isn't any room given the close fit between the statutes to engage in this inconsistent interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.423" offset="8994902">We have pointed out that the legislative history also supports that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.910" offset="9016845">Once again, it just... Section 810 of the Conservation Act comes virtually word for word from a draft of the Claims Settlement Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.368" offset="9058641">It was one of the provisions that was removed from the Claims Settlement Act in 1970 and it appears again almost virtually word for word in the Conservation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.556" offset="9099392">And again, to reemphasize, that the definition of public lands in the two statutes are virtually identical, again, with the Conservation Act, if anything, having a slightly broader application because it includes waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.583" offset="9163444">Just for a second, I would like to talk about what the policy ramifications of a consistent construction between the statutes would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.958" offset="9205031">In the briefs and so forth I think Interior has suggested that applying both statutes to the outer continental shelf would result in Section 810 applying to OCS leasing and that somehow that would be a horrible result which would somehow compromise the nation's interest in developing its oil resources, and it's a somewhat odd argument in that the vast majority of oil which has come from Alaska has come from onshore oil development.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.797" offset="9344316">I don't know precisely what the figures are, but my guess would be 80 or 90 percent of the oil produced which has come from Alaska has been from onshore development.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.653" offset="9383813">And so it wouldn't seem that it would be such a terrible compromise or somehow endanger the national interest to apply the protections of the Conservation Act which obviously Congress intended to apply to onshore development and which everyone in this case concedes apply to onshore development to development on the outer continental shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.150" offset="9469808">Certainly OCS leasing is more risky in the sense that is poses more dangers, and to this point in time it has also not produced nearly as much oil as the onshore development.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.778" offset="9532293">Alternatively, it neither statute applies, there doesn't seem to be or there wouldn't seem to be a tremendous compromise of the national interest in oil development in that case either.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.752" offset="9584120">Obviously, if the Claims Settlement Act does not apply to the outer continental shelf, our position is that we have aboriginal hunting and fishing rights in that area and that we have aboriginal title to those lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.012" offset="9645247">Now, those claims would in all probability preclude oil and gas leasing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2883.743" offset="11684156">The reason for that is essentially twofold, and one is that we have cited several statutes to the Court where the United States, where Congress has essentially enacted statutes which explicitly provide that the outer continental shelf... actually, what they do is, they use the term "federal lands" and then they say "federal lands but not including", and federal lands they defined as lands to which the United States holds title, but then they go on to say,</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.131" offset="11805678">"and this does not include federal lands on the outer continental shelf. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.483" offset="11827098">And we have given the Court... we have cited two cases which have seemed to suggest that in a practical sense that Congress often treats the outer continental shelf as though in fact it does have title to that area, although obviously in international arenas and for formal purposes it would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.563" offset="11907451">The second thing that I think is also fairly persuasive here is that we are not... for purposes of this case we don't have to show that Section 810 applies, that, in other words, the United States holds title to the outer continental shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.708" offset="11975996">All we have to show is that they are leasing an interest to which they hold title, and title merely denotes the ability to sell, and we have pointed out that the United States does assert that it holds... that it does have the authority to sell leasehold interests to the mineral resources of the outer continental shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.640" offset="12067738">So, our point is, for purposes of this case it is not even really necessary to decide that Congress decided that it held title.</text>

            <text syncTime="3167.191" offset="12817975">Your Honor, without getting into my personal feelings about the way the Court of Appeals wrote its decision, what I would say is that I think its decision is fully consistent with Romero-Barcello, and by that what I say is that it seemed to me, and of course you would have a much better idea than I would, that Romero-Barcello says... it relies on TVA v. Hill and it says what has to happen is that analytically we have to look at the statute to see whether an injunction is an appropriate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.431" offset="12962902">In TVA v. Hill, given the statutory language and so forth that an injunction was the appropriate remedy, and then it looked at the Clean Water Act, and under the Clean Water Act the normal violation, the normal remedy for a violation of the Clean Water Act would essentially be an order which the Environmental Protection Agency would obtain which would require compliance at a future date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.800" offset="13080349">And this Court's decision in Romaro Barcello basically says, well, if that is the normal remedy for a violation of the Clean Water Act, then surely that should be... the Court should have that remedy available for a violation of the Clean Water Act by the government, so we think that if you apply that framework, which is to actually look at the language of Section 810, Section 810 sets out with some specificity the timing that certain studies and that certain findings and hearings and so forth have to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.742" offset="13236143">It requires that some of the things be done before the decision to lease is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.598" offset="13263519">In the second sentence it says that other things have to be done before the lease is issued... excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.668" offset="13291836">It says, effected, but in the leasing context that would be issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.387" offset="13306674">And our position is is that given that statutory language, that if the Interior has failed to follow that, that obviously the only way to remedy that would be a preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.230" offset="13362053">Interestingly, we were not the ones in the Court of Appeals who argued for an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.367" offset="13386608">what our position was was that since it was impossible to comply, since Congress had obviously determined that the timing of compliance was extremely important, our position was that it was extremely important, that our proper remedy was an order voiding the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.162" offset="13457766">The government and the oil companies came back and they said, oh, no, the proper remedy is not to void the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.266" offset="13482216">It is to issue, to enjoin activity until such time as interior complies with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.672" offset="13511892">So in some senses we are in a little bit of an odd... then we went back on the remand and we sent it to the District Court and we said, look, your remand order says, decide whether to void the sale or whether to enjoin further exploration and development until Interior complies, and pending that decision, we think you should issue a preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.204" offset="13605932">Of course, now we are here defending the issuance of the preliminary injunction, but that was not the remedy that we requested.</text>

            <text syncTime="3518.370" offset="14222631">I guess finally I would note that counsel says there would be no great disruption if the Claims Settlement Act were extended to the OCS.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.226" offset="14266099">Well, in fact, of course, there have been over $4 billion worth of leases that have been purchased over time in connection with offshore oil and gas activities in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.617" offset="14307581">That would be disrupted both by such an application of that statute and by the application of ANILCA, for that matter, to this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.473" offset="14339033">ANILCA is clear that it does not apply to the OCS.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.358" offset="14354602">This Court should so hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.758" offset="14360244">It is also clear that the Ninth Circuit totally disregarded this Court's opinion in Weinberger versus Romaro Barcello and this Court should so hold so as to cure that or remove that so-called Ninth Circuit rule that ignores that precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.435" offset="14410922">Thank you very much.</text>
