            <label>Mr. William P. Sutter</label>
            <text syncTime="71.003" offset="434316">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="73.518" offset="444347">The Court has postponed consideration of jurisdiction in this case to this hearing, so I will briefly talk about that before I get into the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.764" offset="481337">The contention is made by the appellees that the constitutional issue was not properly raised in the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.558" offset="512475">And that's been briefed heavily by both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.946" offset="530029">What the appellants said in their trial brief, and what was dealt with by the court, both the trial court and the Court of Appeals in California, was the question of whether application of the Unruh Act to Rotary would violate Rotarians constitutional right to freedom of expression, freedom of association.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.907" offset="617905">The Court of Appeals held that the Unruh Act did apply, and that it did not violate the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.903" offset="653849">That, I submit, makes this an appealable case.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.151" offset="670881">I refer the Court to the Pruneyard case, decided only a few years ago, when the Court said, and I'm quoting:</text>
            <text syncTime="138.008" offset="702333">"The California Supreme Court rejected appellant's claim that recognition of such a right violated appellant's right to exclude others, which is a fundamental component of their Federally protected property rights. "</text>
            <text syncTime="150.580" offset="752592">"Appeal is thus the proper method of relief. "</text>
            <text syncTime="153.580" offset="764609">That could be precisely applied to this case if you changed instead of,</text>
            <text syncTime="158.001" offset="782267">"which is a fundamental component of their Federally protected property rights. "</text>
            <text syncTime="163.219" offset="803165">to</text>
            <text syncTime="163.625" offset="804733">"their Federally protected First Amendment rights. "</text>
            <text syncTime="166.187" offset="814973">In either case, the California Supreme Court held that the application of the law did not violate their constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.073" offset="858545">Appeal, it seems to me, is the proper procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.229" offset="871188">However, if it isn't the proper procedure, it is of course within the power of this Court to treat the jurisdictional statement as a petition for certiorari, and to grant certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.677" offset="920925">And in that event, I would hope that this case, which has attracted nationwide attention, which is the first of cases arising on the same issue in six, or eight, or ten other jurisdictions, all involving male-only organizations, such as the Kiwannis, the Lions, the Boy Scouts, that the Court would see fit to take this case on certiorari, if it isn't a direct appeal, and utilize this opportunity hopefully to re-express its devotion and adherence to the First Amendment; but in any event, to put to rest a very serious question involving the rights of male-only or sex-only... there are female-only organizations as well that are interested, and they filed amicus briefs in this case... their rights to exclude members of another sex from what might be termed a private club, a social organization, or a service club as in the case of Rotary.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.152" offset="1170865">Turning to the merits, the case involves the right of individual Rotarians, joined together in local Rotary Clubs, which are social clubs, in which all the courts have found that fellowship, camaraderie, the desire to do good for society, both in the community and in the world at large, are predominant motives and purposes.</text>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="282.421" offset="1279952">But it really doesn't involve the local clubs, does it?</text>
            <text syncTime="285.045" offset="1290401">It... it involves the international affiliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.138" offset="1306806">This particular local club wanted to admit women?</text>

            <label>Mr. William P. Sutter</label>
            <text syncTime="291.964" offset="1318091">That is... this particular club did, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.964" offset="1326137">But I think it inherently must involve the local club.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.948" offset="1342019">The Court of Appeals felt that it must involve the local club, because it said that in deciding the case against International, it must look at and decide whether the local club was itself subject to the Unruh Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.974" offset="1390189">And I submit that's necessary for the following reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.973" offset="1402205">If a local Rotary Club is regarded as a truly private club, and if it is the decision of this Court that a truly private club is not subject to Unruh Act type... because of its First Amendment intimate or expressive associational rights, then a local Rotary club couldn't be found to violate the Unruh Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.478" offset="1500217">What has happened here is that all local Rotary Clubs, which have voluntarily adopted the rule that women may not be members, have joined together in an international confederation known as Rotary International.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="349.599" stopTime="384.181">
            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="349.599" offset="1548700">No, no, no, it doesn't follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.661" offset="1556955">You can find that a local club has constitutional protection with regard to its local association of the 46 members, one with another, without necessarily being drawn to the conclusion that it has constitutional protection with regard to all of its associations, including its decision to affiliate with an international of, what, a million... a million people.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.087" offset="1670640">Those are two quite different questions, aren't they?</text>
            <text syncTime="381.868" offset="1677745">And we don't have to answer them both the same way.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_p_sutter" startTime="384.181" stopTime="464.400">
            <label>Mr. William P. Sutter</label>
            <text syncTime="384.181" offset="1686940">I think we have to decide what the Unruh Act applies to.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.415" offset="1699897">And the California Court of Appeal, reading the Unruh Act, which says that every person has the right to obtain goods and advantages, held that membership in the local club was a good or an advantage; and therefore, it was subject to the Unruh Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.000" offset="1778264">Now it can only reach that decision if the local club, which is the only organization which makes available membership, which is the good or advantage that the Court is talking about, is itself subject to the Unruh Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.573" offset="1836569">Now if the club is not subject to the Unruh Act, then I submit that the International, which does not do business in California, is not registered there, cannot be held to violate the Unruh Act, because it says to a club which can legally discriminate against women, we want you to legally discriminate against women.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.035" offset="1910444">If the local club is subject to the Unruh Act, then so is International for compelling it to violate that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.578" offset="1948582">But I think it is necessary, it is essential, to the decision in this case that the Court find that a local club is subject to the Unruh Act and that the members don't have First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.556" offset="2004484">Now if they don't--</text>

            <text syncTime="464.400" offset="2007828">Why... now you say, jurisdiction over the International is only achieved through the local club?</text>

            <text syncTime="473.367" offset="2043773">--No, I'm not saying that precisely.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.617" offset="2052759">I'm saying that if the local clubs... every local club in California is entitled to exclude women, and it's only the local club that women or anyone else can belong to, because there are no individual members of International, if it is only the local club to which they can belong, and if each of those clubs independently can exclude women, then the fact that the International says, great, we want you to exclude women; you must exclude women if you are to call yourself Rotary... now you can admit women; you can be a local service club; you can do any of those things on your own... but it is only local clubs which have voluntarily agreed not to admit women that can call themselves Rotary because they have made that agreement among themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.691" offset="2257036">Now, I don't think that their making that agreement can cause the International to be violative of the Unruh Act if they are not violative of the Unruh Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.547" offset="2292458">Now if they are, then it is.</text>

            <text syncTime="537.531" offset="2300400">Yes, but you may be mixing up the statutory and the constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.483" offset="2316177">Maybe they violate the Unruh Act by what they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.497" offset="2328298">But your answer would be, well, they have a constitutional right to associate, so the Unruh Act cannot prevent them from making them that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.214" offset="2355152">And it may well be the International violates the Unruh Act by cancelling their franchises.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.870" offset="2377722">But does it necessarily follow they have a constitutional right to cancel their franchise?</text>

            <text syncTime="1179.856" offset="4869699">And why is that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.699" offset="4877013">Because if a local club, which has discretion as to whom to admit, and which has selective grounds for admission, votes a woman down, how can she sue and demonstrate that she was excluded because she was a woman?</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.801" offset="4953500">That's the only case that could bring directly the right of the local club into issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.142" offset="4982862">There are none of those cases around the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.189" offset="4991012">The cases around the country are all cases where the local club, Kiwannis or somebody, did admit a woman, and the enforcement of the aggregation's rules, the association's rules, has then caused that club to be either suspended or to have to remove the woman from membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.401" offset="5063841">And I submit that in every one of those cases, the issue is, is the enforcement of the rule adopted by an aggregation of local clubs, is that enforcement legal?</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.974" offset="5118176">And the question of whether it is legal turns on whether the local clubs actually have the right by themselves to make such a rule, and then to band together and say, all of us are going to abide by the same rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.655" offset="5176899">At that point, it turns into a trademark, service mark, type of case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1285.330" offset="5291629">But in deciding that, it did not look at the International.</text>

            <text syncTime="1878.446" offset="7664070">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.959" offset="7686117">Duarte, which is a local Rotary Club, and the State of California, agree that it's absolutely essential for women to be able to participate in the Rotary International organization, and in the Rotary Clubs of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.062" offset="7738466">Rotary is a service and business organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.170" offset="7750901">To be selected to be a member of Rotary, one has to be a leader in the professional, crafts or business communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.355" offset="7775665">And the point of Rotary is to render service to those communities to alter business practices for the better.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.025" offset="7806385">The harm to women by its being excluded is enormous, because the communication to us is that we're second class citizens, that we aren't business leaders; that one could have a club that is a true cross-section of the business community and exclude us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.519" offset="7864377">And California has a strong, important interest in the ending of discrimination against women and other minorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.876" offset="7893738">This Court has reserved the question of jurisdiction until this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.859" offset="7909725">The jurisdictional question, either by appeal or certiorari, depends upon the existence of a substantial Federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.700" offset="7937102">It is our view, both the State of California and myself on behalf of Duarte, that there... that there is no substantial Federal question, because this case is governed by, and the outcome is the same as, the Jaycees case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.695" offset="7989033">However, there are a couple of distinctions that arguably could be drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.444" offset="8004080">First, the State of California... or actually, second, the State of California will be discussing the differences in the California statute; its version of a public accommodations law, and how it differs from that at issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1984.111" offset="8086731">Well, we have challenged... as we believe they started out, this case was not appropriate for appeal, although by the time they worked it to this Court, there may be grounds for appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.452" offset="8124034">Many commentators, members of this Court as well as others, have suggested that the distinctions between appeal and certiorari have made life difficult for all of us, and have urged that this Court no longer have a mandatory jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.415" offset="8171890">If it's here either under appeal or certiorari, it's because there is a substantial Federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.897" offset="8193833">We do continue to suggest that appeal is inappropriate, but on the certiorari side, the question would be whether or not there is this issue of national significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.190" offset="8231031">And that gets me immediately to the procedural posture of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.346" offset="8243675">The procedural posture is that a local club admitted women, and the international expelled it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.437" offset="8268021">The California Court of Appeals held and enjoined the International from expelling a local that wanted to admit women.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.950" offset="8298009">It is true that in passing the California Court of Appeals did discuss that the local Duarte might be subject... or was subject to the Unruh Act, but that wasn't essential to its holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.681" offset="8345030">There are two reasons why the Court ought not to reach beyond the holding in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.851" offset="8361644">The first is the practical point that not only is it that that's not the case here, that's not even the case coming down the pike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.913" offset="8389960">To my knowledge, there are no cases pending... and I think here I agree with my adversary... not only in terms of Rotary but in terms of similar clubs like Kiwannis and Lions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2401.996" offset="9758254">The California Court of Appeals said, we enjoin you from expelling Duarte while you're... implicitly... while you're here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.588" offset="9784586">And if you choose to leave, of course, I do not believe the State of California could do anything about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.414" offset="9807887">But to return again to this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.411" offset="9815933">Practically, there's no case coming down the pike that involves an individual knocking on a door and a local saying no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.159" offset="9846862">And jurisprudentially, there's a real reason to pause, which goes to the question of, what are the nature of the rights here at the stake?</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.641" offset="9872775">International says that essentially, under the Jaycees' rubric, it has two kinds of rights: expressive freedoms and associational freedoms of intimacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.497" offset="9908197">The Court in the Jaycees opinion explained the two kinds of rights that are available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.309" offset="9931498">On the expressive side this Court discussed the ability of a group to come together to advocate political, social, religious interests, and to come together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.806" offset="9973503">And the question in the test was, would the inclusion of any of these out-group members in any way impair or impede the original members coming together and advocating their rights?</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.832" offset="10021569">If anything, the Rotary International presents an easier example than did the Jaycees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.518" offset="10044347">Rotary is avowedly apolitical and a religious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.828" offset="10057617">Unlike the Jaycees, where there was both the creed and the organization did from time to time take political positions, Rotary is forbidden, the International and the local clubs, from taking any kinds of positions on any political or controversial matters whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.229" offset="10123133">Further, Rotary says, we have three expressed purposes: humanitarian service, worldwide peace, and improving the ethical standards in the business communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.866" offset="10161689">And in order to do that, we're going to take a cross-section of business leaders from a community to do service in the business world.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.943" offset="10190006">There is absolutely nothing about the admission of women that will distort, capture the agenda, or in anyway co-opt Rotary from doing what it wanted to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.283" offset="10231384">In fact, Duarte admitted women because it said, in our community a third of the business leaders are women, and the only way we can be a cross section and influence our community for the good is to include women.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.373" offset="10279763">Moreover, Rotary International permits the inclusion of women in many of its activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.511" offset="10304318">It runs programs for 14 to 18-year-olds, and for 18 to 28-year-olds; women and men, girls and boys, are full participants in those organizations as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.647" offset="10340889">Rotary invites women as speakers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.614" offset="10352697">Women are invited as guests, as... awards have been given to women.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.223" offset="10371191">So it's... so that there's not a hint or a whisper that including women will in any way do any kind of harm to the expressive interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.690" offset="10405046">On the intimacy side, the International is an association of clubs; not an association of members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.203" offset="10435035">In the Jaycees' case, the members were members of the national organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.327" offset="10451544">In the International Rotary, clubs are members of the International organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.450" offset="10468053">There is unquestionably some difference in the way one became a Jaycee and the way one becomes a Rotarian.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.510" offset="10500341">Jaycees between the ages of 18 and 35, submitting an application and paying some dues, if you were male, you became a Jaycee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.336" offset="10531583">To become a Rotarian, there is some selectivity, and that's not disputed, although there is a dispute about how selective it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.645" offset="10560840">But the Court of Appeals and Rotary of Duarte, as well as Seattle and San Francisco and the other clubs that have admitted women, have presented arguments that it is, in fact, quite easy to become a Rotarian.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.561" offset="10608488">But it's undisputed that there's some degree of selectivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.186" offset="10619041">There's selectivity in businesses as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.919" offset="10629908">The fact of selectivity alone is not a trump card that prevents a state from imposing its statute, constitutionally, in an organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.493" offset="10668256">Just as a business is subject to Title VII, so may organizations that have some degree of selectivity be subject to states' antidiscrimination laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.692" offset="10709007">One has to not just say selectivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.005" offset="10718306">One has to say selectivity for what.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.112" offset="10726666">This Court has defined the right of intimate association, in the constitutional sense, as a term of art; a constitutional term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.485" offset="10756236">It is a very limited right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.562" offset="10768462">Parental decisions vis-a-vis children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.420" offset="10779955">Decisions about marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.061" offset="10786538">Family relations and family-type associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.277" offset="10799391">This Court has never extended that right beyond to the kind of large collections that a Rotary Club by definition is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.289" offset="10835440">A local Rotary Club cannot start unless there are at least 20 members fitting 20 different business classifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.427" offset="10863965">And then there have to be another 20 potential classifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.208" offset="10879116">We know from the record that the clubs range in size from 20 to over 900 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.220" offset="10899178">Furthermore, every local Rotary Club must, as a matter of international practice, admit any of the other roughly one million Rotary... Rotarians from around the world to their meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.950" offset="10946094">And further, local Rotary Club members are encouraged to invite students, members of the media, salespersons, employees, various guests to come and come to the meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.633" offset="10996772">So the meetings are not collections of intimates who spend unending numbers of hours one with another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.599" offset="11020700">The meetings are collections of loosely-knit group of people who've come together for the betterment of all of us, for the community and for the business and professional life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.393" offset="11055809">That's not the kind of intimacy that this Court has announced is protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.314" offset="11075557">Really, what Rotary International is saying here is, develop a new constitutional right on behalf of us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.874" offset="11101784">And precisely because it's this expansion of a right that would function to stop a legitimate state statute, it would be tremendously important to have an example of a real, live club that might prompt such a right; a seven-person poker club; a children's club.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.915" offset="11169911">There may be examples of collections of people that this Court might want to think about developing some form of a new right, but surely not on this record, with Rotary telling us that the heart of Rotary is not even its clubs, but rather, its service to the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.628" offset="11236785">Mr. Pigman, the general secretary of Rotary, testified that, after he explained what a Rotary meeting was like in terms of that time, he went on to testify: But you know the heart of Rotary isn't really the clubs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.686" offset="11284955">To really understand Rotary, you've got to go out into the community, because Rotary is engaged in service activities in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.199" offset="11311077">And in those service activities, Rotary joins together with many other groups in the community; with groups that admit women as well as with groups that don't, in doing better for the professional and business world.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.571" offset="11356530">I do want to just also, I guess, reinforce the notion that the fact that there be some chemistry or some... Mr. Pigman testified that it might feel different in terms of the Rotary International rubric, is something that is... it may be true, but it is not that from which new constitutional rights emerge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.827" offset="11441585">Presumably innkeepers 20 years ago, when faced with public accommodation laws, said, it's going to feel different to have blacks in inns or swimming pools or parks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.840" offset="11477634">But this Court did not say, that's a trump; that's the barrier that prevents constitutionally a law from being applied to groups of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.945" offset="11513996">In sum, it is... it is completely constitutional for a State such as California to exercise its sovereign right to limit the... a businesslike organization, such as Rotary International, and indeed, if any Rotary Club followed the rules of... a local Rotary Club as well, and require it, as a businesslike organization, to follow the California statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.418" offset="11627890">The Deputy Attorney General from the State of California will discuss more of the California's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.885" offset="11649833">Thank you.</text>
