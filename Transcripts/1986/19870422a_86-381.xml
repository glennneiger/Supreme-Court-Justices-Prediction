            <text syncTime="35.137" offset="291843">On March 9th, 1984, real parties in interest, Gerard and Richard Smolin took Richard Smolin's two minor children from his school bus stop in Slidell, Louisiana, St. Tammany Parish, and removed them to the State of California.</text>

            <text syncTime="68.643" offset="425799">At the time of the abduction, the children had been living with their mother, in her custody for three years in the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.182" offset="463937">Three days after the abduction, the St. Tammany Parish prosecutor filed simple kidnapping charges against Gerard and Richard Smolin.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.889" offset="510853">And their extradition from the state of California was sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.508" offset="525273">Two months later, in June of 1984, the Louisiana Governor sent a requisition to the Governor of California, requesting the extradition of the Smolin's.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.899" offset="570831">After two more months, in August of 1984, the California Governor granted the extradition request and issued his warrant for the rendition of the Smolin's.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.426" offset="628927">However, the courts of California have now blocked the extradition on the basis that the Smolin's are not actually charged with a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.931" offset="670932">They reached this conclusion only after the habeas corpus courts in California took judicial notice of some other California court records containing a decree which gave Richard Smolin custody of the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.660" offset="737910">Essentially, the habeas corpus court found that since, in light of that decree giving Mr. Smolin custody, he could not be found guilty in the state of Louisiana; therefore, he and his father Gerard were not actually charged with a crime in Louisiana.</text>

            <text syncTime="197.843" offset="942605">The factual questions that may be inquired into in habeas corpus are Number 1: Whether the person before the court is, in fact, the person wanted by the demanding state.</text>

            <text syncTime="627.704" offset="2662089">This is subdivision G of 1738(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="633.174" offset="2683928">A court of a state shall not exercise jurisdiction in any proceeding for a custody determination commenced during the pendency of a proceeding in a court of another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.630" offset="2725724">Or such court of that other state is exercising jurisdiction consistent with the provisions of this section to make custody determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.053" offset="2755503">Just one ground as a possible means of attacking this particular decree that Mr. Smolin is relying upon would be that there were pending Texas proceedings regarding the custody of these children at the time he went in to the California court to get the custody decree modified in his favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.518" offset="2853306">He was aware of those Texas proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.287" offset="2864382">Those Texas proceedings were being held in order to receive a full faith and credit recognition of the original California order.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.213" offset="2916104">There was no notice to the California court when Mr. Simolin went in to get his modified decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.432" offset="2937002">The Texas proceedings were already pending; therefore, there would be a violation of this section of the Federal act.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.271" offset="2964378">The point is, in these custody disputes and I'd rather get back to the extradition issue, but in these custody disputes the key under both the Federal act and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act is communication where there might be problems with concurrent jurisdiction, where more than one court might have jurisdiction over the custody matters involving these particular children.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.386" offset="3060822">Communication did not occur in this case; therefore, we have a result of conflicting custody orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.576" offset="3093528">So, the point of all this is that it was not that cut and dried that he could not be charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.182" offset="3128009">This actually goes to the merits of the case in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.134" offset="3143787">And, of course, this is my base line position that those have to be delved into only where the charges are pending out in the asylum state.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.989" offset="3179209">That is not part of the summary executive proceeding that we call extradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.559" offset="3209511">This Court has on numerous occasions recognized that extradition is intended to be a summary executive proceeding in which the courts of the asylum state play an extremely limited role.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.985" offset="3263219">In Michigan v. Doran, this Court clearly stated that a court of an asylum state can do no more than decide those four issues that I enumerated a little bit earlier.</text>

            <label>Mr. Dennis P. Riordan</label>
            <text syncTime="1682.713" offset="6882119">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.515" offset="6897270">I'd like to begin by trying to clarify what's been at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.152" offset="6915869">I think it's gotten a little muddled because Mr. Jibson came here today looking to hit a single and he's been invited to hit a home run.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.840" offset="6950664">And I think his position in response to that has changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.376" offset="6964770">Before we got here the following things were clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.078" offset="6979608">One the California decree giving Richard Smolin sole custody of his child in 1981 was valid in '81, it's valid in '84.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.552" offset="7021508">The issue has been completely litigated by both parties in California, that's a matter of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.504" offset="7041257">He was the legal custodian of his children in 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.075" offset="7055572">What was clear before we came here today was that under federal law, that decree has to be respected in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.281" offset="7092352">It was clear, one, because that federal law holding by the California Supreme Court was never challenged by California before this Court, which it could have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.953" offset="7127043">It's also clear because the plain language of 28 U.S.C. 1738(a) makes it absolutely apparent that Louisiana will and must respect the 1981 California decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.261" offset="7180333">Furthermore, if you look at the case law in Louisiana interpreting 1738(a), and I can cite the Court to two cases, it's absolutely plain that they will hold that California was the only state that could modify the decree, that the '81 decree was valid.</text>

            <text syncTime="1783.244" offset="7284195">It's a Full Faith and Credit Act which is found in 28 U.S.C., which was passed by Congress to make sure that there could only be one valid custody decree at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.552" offset="7329440">And under the terms of that act, the only valid custody decree in 1984, when Richard Smolin picked up his children, was the California decree.</text>

            <text syncTime="3507.426" offset="14180940">First of all, we do deem this a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.680" offset="14197972">It is a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.780" offset="14202360">The charges are still pending in the state of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.000" offset="14219288">What brought this into the criminal justice system was Mr. Smolin's exercise of self-help, which is in itself, one of the things that the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act, by its very title is designed to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.860" offset="14278742">And, I don't want to get into the, to make this a custody case but this Court does not have to decide the question of who's entitled to custody here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.414" offset="14308940">Suffice it to say as it was stated earlier, the Louisiana prosecutor does dispute this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.770" offset="14338302">And, I've got some knowledge about him, but I'm not going to go outside the record either to tell you his reasons for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.341" offset="14368604">But the point is, what's being attempted here is simply to come in through the back door with what you cannot come in through the front door with and that is a defense to this charge in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.266" offset="14420326">This analogy to a judgment on the pleadings, I think, is inappropriate because that by definition is restricted to the pleadings and here they had to go outside the pleadings which in this case, are the extradition documents to bring in some extraneous evidence to show a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.812" offset="14490543">And, we're not to inquire into the prosecutor's motives in the state of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.382" offset="14516770">Communication has been had with authorities in both states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.369" offset="14536728">They are anxious to go forward with this case and if, in fact, there is an air tight defense for Mr. Smolin, then he is to bring that in the state of Louisiana where these charges are pending.</text>
