            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="144788">The first case for argument this morning is Number 85-129, Linda Wimberly, Petitioner, versus Labor and Industrial Relations Commission of Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.908" offset="196406">Ms. Levin, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="julie_s_levin" startTime="15.426" stopTime="230.464">
            <label>Ms. Julie S. Levin</label>
            <text syncTime="15.426" offset="206437">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.228" offset="217617">The issue in this case involves the question of whether Missouri is violating a federal statute, 26 United States Code 3304(a)(12) by denying unemployment compensation benefits to women like Mrs. Wimberly who have left their jobs because of their pregnancy and are then denied reinstatement in those jobs when they are able to return to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.493" offset="310718">The statute provides in part that no person shall be denied compensation under state law, solely on the basis of pregnancy or termination of pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.616" offset="355230">On August 23rd, 1980, Mrs. Wimberly, who was then seven months pregnant, went to her employer of three years, J. C. Penney Company, and asked her supervisor if she could have a maternity leave of absence because she was physically unable to continue working.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.358" offset="414163">At that time, her supervisor told her she could have a leave of absence but that the policy of the company was that it did not guarantee the reinstatement of an employee in the event that no positions were available when the employee was ready to return to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.552" offset="466930">Mrs. Wimberly took her leave of absence and on November 5th, 1980, she had her baby daughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.106" offset="493157">Three and a half weeks later she called her supervisor and told her that she was ready to return to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.426" offset="518444">At that time she was told that,</text>
            <text syncTime="95.795" offset="527952">"There are no jobs available and you'll have to quit. "</text>
            <text syncTime="98.497" offset="538715">Mrs. Wimberly then applied for unemployment compensation benefits with the State of Missouri and a deputy for the Division of Employment Security held that she was disqualified because she quit because of pregnancy, and under Missouri law that's deemed a voluntary quit without good cause attributable to the work or the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.160" offset="621366">After administrative appeals and lower court decisions, the Missouri Supreme Court held that the administrative decision was correct and that Section 3304(a)(12) is merely an antidiscrimination statute that requires pregnancy to be treated the same as disability, and the pregnancy cannot be disadvantaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.872" offset="696181">But, the Missouri Supreme Court misinterpreted the federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.490" offset="714675">It is not just an antidiscrimination statute, but rather it is a broad, comprehensive prohibition of pregnancy related disqualifications of eligible women.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.862" offset="752187">The language and the legislative history and the whole purpose behind this statute establishes that this was what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.285" offset="781862">The purpose of the statute was to provide economic security for eligible women who were forced to leave their jobs because of pregnancy and childbirth.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.474" offset="818643">Congress was aware of the prevalence of women in the work force.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.593" offset="835152">There are 21 million women of childbearing age in the work force.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.663" offset="851348">Eighty-five percent of these women will have at least one child during their working lives.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.151" offset="873291">Congress was aware of the tremendous hardship that these women and their families suffer when the women are denied reinstatement in their jobs after childbirth and also denied unemployment compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.756" offset="915714">Without a source of income to aid and support themselves and their families while they are actively seeking re-employment, and also to provide necessary expenses such as child care cost and transportation to facilitate their re-entry into the work force, women are at a tremendous disadvantage in competing in the employment process.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.151" offset="989379">Congress recognized this problem and in the interest of promoting childbirth, protecting the economic security of families, and also preventing family disintegration due to unemployment and lack of income, Congress enacted the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.429" offset="1050401">The statute is not an antidiscrimination statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="259.317" offset="1181954">The State Court's rationale was that the voluntary quit statute in Missouri is a neutral statute and therefore they can use that statute to disqualify benefits to Mrs. Wimberly and to women who leave their job because of pregnancy, as long as they do the same treatment to people who leave their job because of disability.</text>

            <text syncTime="1510.968" offset="6188582">In Missouri, applicants for unemployment compensation benefits are disqualified if they left their last places of employment for reasons which were not attributable to their work or to their employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1536.935" offset="6292445">In this case, if Mrs. Wimberly had left to recover from an automobile accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.689" offset="6319508">She would have been disqualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.724" offset="6327658">If she left work because her husband was transferred to a different city, she would be disqualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.778" offset="6351900">On the record of this case there is absolutely no suggestion whatsoever that Missouri does not apply this work related standard in an entirely nondiscriminatory way, neutrally applying to all non-work related separations from employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.922" offset="6428386">A temporary physical disability of any kind in Missouri, if not work related, is disqualified, just as any other good but not work related reason is disqualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.166" offset="6481363">This suggests the legislative intent for the program, the Unemployment Compensation program in the State of Missouri, be related to actual employment conditions, to the actual conduct of employers, to the actual economic realities that cause employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1606.614" offset="6571224">Does the federal standard enacted by Congress in 1976, providing that states may not deny unemployment compensation benefits solely by reason of pregnancy or termination of pregnancy, preclude the state from continuing to apply this neutral rule to pregnant applicants?</text>

            <text syncTime="1723.304" offset="7037980">I don't know the precise answer to that question, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.256" offset="7053758">I know at least two states after Turner and after this legislation was passed specifically enacted statutes which said on their face that pregnancy would be treated just like all other disabilities for purposes of unemployment compensation, and both of those states' programs have been approved by the Department of Labor since that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.252" offset="7133692">The states that changed in that way, I believe, were Tennessee and... well, actually I said states... Tennessee and the District of Columbia which is not a state, Mr. Justice Brennan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.179" offset="7197431">In the briefs filed on behalf of petitioner, it is suggested that unemployment compensation programs are insurance programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.969" offset="7236615">In a way they are, but it's employers who pay the premiums in the form of taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.623" offset="7259185">In Missouri those employers are insuring against the risk of paying unemployment compensation benefits to their former employees who left work because of the manner in which the employers conducted their business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.364" offset="7314146">They were not insuring against the risk that their former employees would be paid compensation benefits because they left work for personal reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.787" offset="7347897">The focus of the federal law, as pointed out in a soliloquy between my opposing counsel and Justice O'Connor, is the reason for the state's denial of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.479" offset="7402649">The benefits will not be denied solely by reason of pregnancy or termination of pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.467" offset="7434623">The focus of the federal law is on the reason for the denial, not upon the motivation of the applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.056" offset="7460955">The petitioner wants the Court to read this statute as providing that no one may be denied unemployment compensation benefits if she solely left her work only because she was pregnant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.399" offset="7526365">As pointed out in the soliloquy between Mr. Justice Scalia and opposing counsel, it is entirely inconsistent to assume, based upon that particular interpretation of law, that the state can require a pregnant woman to be physically able to work but cannot require her separation from employment to be work related.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.264" offset="7613823">In both cases, the reason she left work was because she was pregnant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.085" offset="7637124">The federal statute does not speak to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.787" offset="7647887">The federal statute speaks to the reason she was denied benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.839" offset="7664083">Mrs. Wimberly was denied benefits because the reason she left work was not work related.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.326" offset="7686026">All persons suffering a temporary physical disability with no guaranteed reinstatement are denied benefits in Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.796" offset="7715910">The plain language of the statute suggests an intent on the part of Congress to single out... to prohibit states from singling out pregnancy for specific treatment, for distinctive treatment, for treatment different than it treats other conditions that applicants may fall under.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.745" offset="7807756">We must impute, I think, to Congress the ability to use precision in its language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.749" offset="7831684">In effect, Congress said states may not, for the sole cause of pregnancy, deny benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1962.993" offset="7996674">Not only does the plain language of the statute suggest an intent that pregnancy specific disqualifications or findings of ineligibility... and clearly this law was designed both for problems of eligibility and disqualification, both are reasons for denying benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.108" offset="8089147">An applicant, in order to get benefits in any state must have worked for a specified period of time at a specified wage, must be able and available to work, must not be disqualified for state law reasons, or be denied on the basis of any of those reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.768" offset="8143795">So, eligibility and disqualification was both the subject of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.803" offset="8159991">Congress was acting in a specific context when it enacted this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.807" offset="8179949">I have already referred to the information provided to Congress by the Department of Labor about the 19 states that had pregnancy specific statutes on their books.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.246" offset="8217670">It was also replying to this Court's decision, 1975 decision in Turner versus Department of Employment Security.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.050" offset="8248912">In effect, all the information available to Congress, and the legislative history is clear that these are the things they were considering, were concerned with states that discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.374" offset="8290186">I submit it is illogical to assume that Congress intended to replace discriminatory state laws with a mandate, discriminatory state laws unfavorable to pregnant women, with a mandate that states have to prefer state women.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.152" offset="8361343">It did not intend to replace discrimination detrimental to women with discrimination favorable to women.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.925" offset="8400422">I think the only assumption is that when Congress acts to eradicate discrimination or distinctive treatment by sex or by pregnancy, it intends to legislate the quality of treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.833" offset="8444099">Two years after it enacted this particular standard, it enacted the amendments to Title 7, Pregnancy Discrimination Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.089" offset="8485059">Its language there specifically said that in the work place, the terms and conditions of employment, pregnant women are to be treated the same as others similarly situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.062" offset="8524974">It is entirely inconsistent that Congress intended to legislate equality of treatment for pregnant women in the workplace with preferential treatment for pregnant women once they left the workplace and applied for unemployment compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.839" offset="8584115">Both are employment related.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.756" offset="8591743">I think the assumption must be that when Congress acts so close in time, that they intended to act consistently, to in fact require the states to treat pregnant women the same way they treat other applicants for benefits, which in Missouri is what occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.618" offset="8655168">I have been representing the State of Missouri and its agencies, departments and officers for some 15 years, and for the first time in my experience the American Civil Liberties Union has entered a case supporting my position on the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2180.416" offset="8866447">I assure you that if the State of Missouri starts tomorrow preferring the applications of pregnant women as against others with other disabilities, we will at least be some years down the road applying to this Court for review under Title 7 of the Equal Protection Clause, because in effect there would be sex based discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2400.826" offset="9748027">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.753" offset="9799750">This is an appropriate case to defer to the Department of Labor's interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.705" offset="9819603">The Department has consistently stated that Section 3304(a)(12) bars states from singling out women for unfavorable treatment on the basis of pregnancy, but does not mandate preferential treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.880" offset="9872266">Congress has directed the Secretary to certify each year the states that are in compliance with the requirements of the federal Unemployment Tax Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.236" offset="9909673">Because of its central role in administering the statute, the Department participated in the proceedings that led to the enactment of Section 3304(a)(12).</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.342" offset="9946140">At a hearing on the unemployment compensation laws in 1975, a representative of the Department testified that some states treated inability to work because of pregnancy differently from any other kind of physical disability, and that that different treatment was undesirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.237" offset="10021686">Shortly after the enactment of Section 3304(a)(12), the Department sent the states instructions on its implementation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.509" offset="10054809">The Department first noted that any provision of state law specifically relating to pregnancy in the determination of entitlement to benefits must be deleted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.301" offset="10101934">The Department then explained that the statute, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.836" offset="10116040">"requires that the entitlement to benefits for pregnant claimants be determined on the same basis and under the same provisions applicable to all other claimants. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.493" offset="10158672">It does not mean that pregnant claimants are entitled to benefits without meeting the requirements of the law for the receipt of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.897" offset="10188347">It requires only that a pregnant claimant not be treated differently under the law from any other unemployed individual, and that the benefits be paid or denied not on the basis of pregnancy but on the basis of whether she meets the statute's condition for the receipt of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.692" offset="10255534">In a supplement to those instructions, also in 1976, the Department noted that some states denied benefits to claimants who must leave their jobs because of illness or injury, including pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.686" offset="10311436">The Department stated that the new law permits preferential treatment of pregnant claimants, but does not mandate preferential treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.374" offset="10346231">The Department specifically reaffirmed the views it expressed in 1976, in 1980 in a letter solicited during the litigation of Brown v. Porcher.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.015" offset="10392834">The letter addressed the validity of a South Carolina rule which was essentially indistinguishable from the statute at issue here, the rule at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.638" offset="10435257">The Department concluded that the South Carolina rule was not inconsistent with federal law because, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.394" offset="10466290">"It does not distinguish between pregnant claimants or any other unemployed individuals whose separation is due to illness. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.480" offset="10498682">unquote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.130" offset="10501294">The Department of Labor's 1976 statement regarding the statute and its submission to the Court in Porcher in 1980 accurately summarized the federal government's position in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.557" offset="10555002">The United States agrees with Missouri that it may enforce neutral rules in determining who will receive unemployment compensation benefits, even though women who left work because of pregnancy are denied benefits as a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.917" offset="10616442">The Department's interpretation of the statute it administers, which is based on its involvement in the proceedings leading to the enactment of the statute, which it announced shortly after the enactment of the provision and to which it has adhered through three administrations, is entitled to considerable deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.230" offset="10697630">Petitioner argues primarily that the Department of Labor's interpretation of Section 3304(a)(12) is not entitled to deference because it conflicts with the statute's unambiguous language which, in her view, is that a woman who leaves work solely because she is pregnant cannot be denied benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.214" offset="10801598">In our view the statute plainly invalidates only state laws that single out women for unfavorable treatment on the basis of pregnancy, for the reasons stated by Justice O'Connor earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.355" offset="10854156">The language of the statute makes that clear because it focuses on the state's basis for the denial of benefits, not on the claimant's reason for leaving work, and prohibits denials based solely on pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.714" offset="10915596">But assuming that it is not clear on the face of the statute that it only invalidates rules that single out pregnant women for unfavorable treatment, it is nevertheless clear that the statute does not mean what petitioner says it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.624" offset="10975260">As Justice Scalia noted earlier, petitioner admits as she must that states are free to enforce a number of neutral rules that lead to the denial of benefits to women who left work because of pregnancy, such as rules that claimants must be available for work and able to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.419" offset="11046417">Thus, petitioner acknowledges that states may apply neutral rules that lead to the denial of benefits to women who left work because of pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.226" offset="11085601">We pointed this flaw in petitioner's argument out in our brief, and petitioner replies, as she did earlier today, that the language of Section 3304(a)(12) addresses only disqualification, not eligibility, so neutral eligibility rules that lead to the denial of benefits to women who left work because of pregnancy are permissible while neutral rules looking to disqualification are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.276" offset="11189882">There is simply no basis for petitioner's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.478" offset="11202630">Neither the word 3304(a)(12).</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.833" offset="11232096">Rather, the statute is addressed to the basis for the state's denial of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.820" offset="11259995">Moreover, as Justice Scalia pointed out, logically under petitioner's reading of the statute a state could pass a law that says, all women who leave work because of pregnancy are ineligible for benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.980" offset="11316628">That can't be what the statute means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.432" offset="11326450">Since the language of the statute does not mean what petitioner says it plainly means, this Court must conclude either that it plainly means what the Department of Labor in Missouri says it means, or conclude that the language of the statute does not plainly resolve the question presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.560" offset="11402937">If the Court concludes that the language plainly means that states may not single out women for unfavorable treatment on the basis of pregnancy, then the decision below should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.551" offset="11446927">If the Court concludes that the language of the statute does not resolve the issue, it is still clear that the opinion below should be affirmed because in that event the Department of Labor's consistent interpretation of the statute it administers, which it announced contemporaneously with the enactment of the statute, and which it based in part on its involvement in proceedings leading to the enactment, is entitled to considerable deference.</text>

            <text syncTime="2908.804" offset="11779936">The Solicitor General has stated that he does not understand how the eligibility provisions that we found can apply under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.981" offset="11840644">But on page 12 of his brief he acknowledges that the eligibility provisions do apply because of the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.236" offset="11877634">I just wanted to note that, in reference to the earlier point that we were making.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.973" offset="11896651">This Court should not defer to the Department of Labor interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.461" offset="11914623">First of all, the Unemployment Insurance Service, according to the Solicitor General, has been the entity or the unit that has been making these interpretations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.965" offset="11948582">There has been no cited statutory or regulatory authority for this unit to make interpretations of a federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.637" offset="11983273">Additionally, there has been no official interpretation of this statute by the Department of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.891" offset="12008350">There has been no regulation, no adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.944" offset="12024546">All we have are letters and memoranda, and under the... even if we had an official interpretation, under the Chevron standards the precise issue of this case has been dealt with in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.102" offset="12077105">The legislative history is very clear, that the statute was to abolish disqualifications of women who left their job on account of pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.790" offset="12111900">Mrs. Wimberly left her job on account of pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.142" offset="12125275">That's the only reason she was unemployed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.511" offset="12134783">And that was the basis of her denial for unemployment compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.296" offset="12149934">The construction and the interpretation of the Department of Labor is not a permissible interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.919" offset="12184416">It does not make sense that Congress would have told states to abolish their statutory disqualifications of women based on pregnancy, but that the states could go ahead and use their neutral statutes to continue the same prohibited practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.329" offset="12246065">The whole purpose of the statute was to get benefits to women who were leaving their jobs because of pregnancy, because it was such a burden and a hardship for these women and their families that Congress needed to address the issue, and Congress would not have intended that states use neutral statutes to continue these same practices they told the states to abolish.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.610" offset="12335195">Moreover, the Department of Labor has no special expertise or technical knowledge that's necessary to interpret this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.383" offset="12370303">In the Chevron case the EPA had knowledge, special knowledge necessary to interpret the Clean Air Act standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.739" offset="12403740">But no such knowledge is necessary in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.358" offset="12414189">The Commission has suggested that Title 7 will take care of the problems of discrimination and that this case... that a holding in this case is going to conflict with Title 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.169" offset="12493392">But as we stated earlier, Title 7 is not involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.223" offset="12509588">Congress could very easily have decided to give benefits to women in this situation over disability, and not to give benefits to women over disability in Title 7, because Title 7 is all-encompassing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.631" offset="12563296">It's a heavier burden on the employer in Title 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.416" offset="12578447">In 3304(a)(12) the burden is much greater on the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.720" offset="12595583">Unemployment is comparable to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.171" offset="12605405">It's the final act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.138" offset="12609271">Whereas in Title 7, problems that you have and you experience in employment are not as great as the final act of unemployment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.444" offset="12646470">The hardship to the woman and to the family when she's unemployed, especially right after having a baby, is so tremendous that Congress could very easily have decided to enact this statute here and continue having similar treatment under Title 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.839" offset="12716060">Additionally, the Solicitor General and the Commission have suggested that equal protection... I'm sorry, the Solicitor General did not suggest this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.845" offset="12756079">The Solicitor General agrees that there are no equal protection problems if this Court rules in our favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.367" offset="12782202">The Commission, however, still seems to see some equal protection problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.252" offset="12797771">But this Court, in the Michaelam case and in the Botzger case, this Court held that men and women are not always similarly situated and men and women are not similarly situated in matters of pregnancy and childbirth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.829" offset="12852001">A man can never experience the same burden that a woman has in having to leave your job because of pregnancy and being denied reinstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.601" offset="12887110">And when men and women are not similarly situated, Congress can enact statutes that distinguish between the two of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.022" offset="12920860">Mrs. Wimberly left her job only because of her pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.158" offset="12941340">She became unemployed only because of her pregnancy and only because... and she was denied reinstatement by the State of Missouri solely on the basis of her pregnancy.</text>
