            <text syncTime="86.039" offset="488333">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, and it involves a purely legal issue of the interpretation of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 23(c), specifically the permissible factors that federal courts can take into account in determining whether or not to release a successful habeas petitioner pending an appeal by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.558" offset="610377">Relying almost exclusively on the decision of the Third Circuit in Carter against Rafferty, the Third Circuit has held and the district court below have held that they will only take into account the possibility of flight in making this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.253" offset="685192">The state of New Jersey, Petitioner herein, is arguing that there are additional factors that are properly considered under 23(c), including the chances of success on appeal by the state as a factor that the court should take into account, as well as the dangerousness of the Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.218" offset="777038">Initially, I would note with respect to the factor of likelihood of success on appeal, that issue I don't think was considered by the Carter court.</text>

            <text syncTime="179.199" offset="860944">And I think the rationale of the Carter decision, which is something that we take issue with but I'll get into later, even if you apply the rationale of the Carter decision, which is the federal courts can only take into account what it perceives as a federal interest, if you apply that rationale you would see that the chances of state success on appeal is also a federal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.397" offset="957806">We have the state as a party in a federal action.</text>

            <text syncTime="211.151" offset="988839">There is an appeal to a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.170" offset="996885">So the outcome of that appeal is certainly an issue which the federal courts have an interest in, and should be an appropriate factor under 23(c) even if you accept the Carter analysis--</text>
            <text syncTime="227.346" offset="1053623">However, we don't think that the Carter court interpreted 23(c) properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.517" offset="1082253">We think that there are a number of reasons to reject the narrow interpretation that the Carter court adopted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.307" offset="1125407">The first one is, the Carter court held that the only interest, the only factor, is a probability of flight.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.281" offset="1169293">We think that the language of the rule, which is extremely broad and which says that a petitioner is presumed to be released... it doesn't specifically use the word of presumption of release, but the state would concede that the rule does contain a presumption of release.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.427" offset="1245884">The presumption of release is there when a petitioner is successful in district court, but it can be overcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.099" offset="1280575">He shall be released unless a court shall order otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.305" offset="1317459">In those instances... that's kind of broad language right there.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.526" offset="1338253">It's extremely broad language, and we don't think there's any reason to believe that it narrowly confines the federal courts to the probability of flight.</text>

            <text syncTime="2374.021" offset="9640281">I think that the existence of the rule does mean that a stay of one in a habeas, in a unique habeas situation, does not necessarily apply to the other, because the defendant's interest in custody, particularly in a short sentence case like this, particularly in a case where the appeal would be going on long after he was released under regular parole rules in New Jersey, would mean that he would have, if the release decision was held to be stayed as opposed to simply the judgment, he would have no remedy at all.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark H. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="3033.394" offset="12277812">--The federal court should do precisely what it did in Carter anyway, because the fact is the federal court has its own rules to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.833" offset="12315533">I do not think that what the state court does should affect what the federal court does, because all that proves is that under certain situations the state can handle the problem of its defendants any way it pleases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.975" offset="12364121">And I think that that should certainly not affect whether or not a federal court should grant it in similar situations, since we are talking about concurrent jurisdictions here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.199" offset="12408947">Your question raises the ultimate issue in this case, particularly as regards dangerousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.436" offset="12433920">The fact is that there is no roving commission in either the federal courts or the state courts to sweep dangerous people off the streets wherever they find them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.975" offset="12472059">Dangerousness and the determination of who shall be held because they're dangerous follows the forms of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.696" offset="12494942">The area of preventive pretrial detention or the area of detention of unconvicted defendants, whatever analogue you use, is a quintessentially state concern, and Carter pays deference to that state concern by allowing the states to act on this defendant, who is no longer subject to conviction, in any way they please as long as their decision is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.113" offset="12604656">And after all, this Court has not determined whether preventive detention is unconstitutional in any case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.065" offset="12624405">But the fact is that the Hobson's choice that their positing because they can't out a dangerous person away simply does not exist, or if it does exist it's because the polity, as I said, of the state of New Jersey, its Constitution and its voters, have determined that that's how they wish to run their affairs in the criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.411" offset="12705802">The Hobson's choice does not exist in any case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.530" offset="12718341">There is nothing about what the federal court would do in the release decision that would prevent this appeal from going forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.267" offset="12745299">And what would simply happen is he would be released on a sufficient surety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.488" offset="12762122">If the state instead, as I indicated earlier to Justice Scalia's question, decides that they wish to retry this person, then as Justice Scalia indicated earlier, by submitting the defendant once again to state processes on retrial, they cannot hold him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.998" offset="12820219">What avenue is that out of their Hobson's choice?</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.716" offset="12835056">The fact is that the state's right to appeal has ample protection in this Court, in the appellate court, regardless of what happens to this defendant in terms of his custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.757" offset="12879255">Their interests are protected in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.125" offset="12888659">Allowing the defendant to be held while the appeal goes on would do nothing more in a case like this one, where we've already passed the first anniversary of this appeal in the Third Circuit, than extinguish the defendant's rights to an effective remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.033" offset="12940277">And the Court should pay some concern to that, because certainly the state's interests that Petitioners put forth as a party litigant are amply protected without any regard to Rule 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.277" offset="12997329">In closing, Your Honors, we do feel that the Carter decision as we have described it serves the interests of every party properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.882" offset="13031706">It serves the interests of this Court, that this Court has shown in federalism and comity, by allowing the states to act within their proper sphere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.321" offset="13065456">It safeguards the rights of the defendant by allowing him to have an efficacious remedy while the appeal is pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.110" offset="13104640">And it would do substantial justice in a case of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.296" offset="13121358">If Your Honors intend to depart from Carter, I would submit it should do by finding an unmistakably federal interest or one that is related to the federal role in habeas cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.604" offset="13166602">Since the state has presented no such interest here, in our judgment, since no interest cognizable by the federal court could justify holding this defendant, whatever the test, we think that the decision of the Third Circuit en banc in refusing to grant a stay or to reconsider the Carter opinion should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.617" offset="13246641">If Your Honors have no further questions.</text>
