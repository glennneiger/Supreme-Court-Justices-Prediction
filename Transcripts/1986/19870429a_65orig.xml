            <text syncTime="112.221" offset="599649">The second issue is whether the Court should order New Mexico to pay in the future water in excess of its compact obligation to make up for a shortfall from 1950 to 1983 when New Mexico's obligation was unknown.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.981" offset="670702">As Justice White pointed out to the Court the master did recommend a 340,000 acre foot shortfall be determined here.</text>

            <text syncTime="146.662" offset="737471">What New Mexico does take exception to is that the master recommended that that entire amount of shortfall be presumed or inferred due to man's activities in New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.624" offset="793268">New Mexico also takes exception to the master's proposal for relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="175.852" offset="854186">That is required under the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.914" offset="862441">But then he went on to propose, to recommend that New Mexico also be required to pay water and to pay in water for shortfalls from 1950 to 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.595" offset="921164">He recommended that New Mexico be required to pay that amount of water in a maximum time period of 13 years when the shortfalls accrued over a 34-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.076" offset="967139">And finally, he recommended that the Court order New Mexico to pay water interest at Treasury bill rates if New Mexico falls too far short.</text>

            <text syncTime="462.194" offset="1999603">The first stage is the one that the Court is now approaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.162" offset="2015485">What is New Mexico's obligation?</text>
            <text syncTime="469.020" offset="2026875">That is the first stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.644" offset="2033353">The compacting parties have specifically considered whether at that stage they should provide for retroactive relief for debit-credit accounting, and they said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.531" offset="2076925">They said no for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.280" offset="2087897">The first reason is that they felt that they wanted to leave the compact flexible to accommodate change in the future, and so when they selected a method which required such complicated analysis, they said, we don't know enough about this river.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.288" offset="2151949">This is an extremely difficult river.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.226" offset="2159681">Let us leave it open in the future to change, to correction of the method, to replacement of the system to more accurately define the obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.096" offset="2199178">And if we tie it to a debit-credit system it would be impossible for the parties, it will make it very difficult for the parties to make the changes that are required that should happen in the future in this dynamic compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.340" offset="2256125">So that was the first reason that they said when we are arriving at New Mexico's obligation in the first instance, when we are trying to define man's activities, when we are coming to that point, in that instance there will not be retroactive relief, and they had a second reason which is related to the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.286" offset="2331985">That second reason is that New Mexico cannot know exactly what its obligation is until the obligation is determined in light of the man's activities finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.688" offset="2385588">It cannot know in advance exactly what that amount of water will be.</text>

            <text syncTime="700.460" offset="2952654">In other words, New Mexico cannot maintain all of the uses that it had on the river in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.989" offset="2978777">It is tied to depletions which had appeared on the river, and rivers, particularly this river, which is tied to two separate aquifer systems, don't show depletions right away.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.391" offset="3028409">It takes a while for the water to get there, and different rainfalls may cause different effects, and changing where a well is located may cause different effects.</text>

            <text syncTime="1505.313" offset="6172089">When New Mexico agreed to this compact at the outset of the negotiations in 1943 New Mexico made it plain that because this river was so variable, and because the calculations required were so extremely difficult to do correctly, New Mexico wanted to ensure that it would never be charged for any losses which were not found due, which were not shown due to man's activities in New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.799" offset="6301970">The problem here is that what the court, what the master heard evidence on was not man's activities in New Mexico.</text>
