            <text syncTime="60.867" offset="382398">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="64.599" offset="397236">I do not believe that a recitation of the facts is important in this case, that is the facts with respect to the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.362" offset="432344">In fact, the thrust of this particular petition lies on the premise that basically the facts don't matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.951" offset="470692">By that I mean it really does not matter whether this judgment that Alan and Cara Woods obtained was based on impressive theories of liability and damages or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.150" offset="527535">It really does not matter whether the rulings of Judge Clemon which were attacked on the appeal were soundly grounded in established law or whether they were based upon less substantial bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.391" offset="604439">And it really doesn't matter whether our appeal was substantial or frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.090" offset="635264">This petition is based upon the application of an Alabama statute that operates automatically in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.727" offset="685837">Essentially, there are three conditions for the application of the ten percent fee:</text>
            <text syncTime="143.131" offset="711437">First, the appeal must be taken by a defendant, and it's the defendant in a case involving either money or property.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.656" offset="757517">Second, the judgment must be superseded.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.529" offset="776952">I suppose a better word is stayed, because we have a procedure in Alabama where municipalities can stay a judgment without actually putting up a bond, and they are subject to this ruling just as much as private parties are who have to put a supersedeas bond up.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.304" offset="852080">And third, it has to be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.443" offset="860648">The affirmance has to be in toto.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.254" offset="875904">If there is an affirmance by modification in any way, then the affirmance penalty does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.737" offset="905788">We have brought this petition on the first question based on a claim that this statute violates both the equal protection clause and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.745" offset="973915">I frankly believe that each of them, each of the clauses, is applicable.</text>

            <text syncTime="217.571" offset="1009128">--wouldn't the first inquiry in point of logic be whether or not a federal court sitting in Alabama should apply this Alabama rule in this particular proceeding, which arose out of diversity jurisdiction, rather than whether the statute is unconstitutional?</text>
            <text syncTime="232.129" offset="1067433">That doesn't necessary mean you would have to argue it would be that way.</text>

            <text syncTime="235.190" offset="1079659">Well, I'm arguing the other way to try and induce you to go the other way, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.939" offset="1094601">And if I could explain my reasoning as to why I believe you should go to the constitutional question first, I'm aware of the rules of construction regarding constitutional questions, although we have constitutional questions both on the first question and the second question.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.366" offset="1188328">But this rule of construction is grounded on a policy of avoiding deciding questions you don't have to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.346" offset="1240259">Now, my pitch to you, so to speak, is that if you go to the question of federal-state relations first and if I'm fortunate enough to win, the question of the due process and equal protection is still there.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.681" offset="1321657">You've got three or four cases in the hopper right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.758" offset="1333882">We have some 40 or 50 appeals, by our count, where this penalty is applied in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.539" offset="1357079">Mississippi has a similar statute and I assume they have a similar number.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.614" offset="1373379">The question--</text>

            <text syncTime="310.598" offset="1381321">I mean, you're saying grasp the constitutional issues that you're likely to have to grasp sooner or later.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.579" offset="1405249">That's certainly not... that's just not the way we behaved in the past, anyway.</text>

            <text syncTime="325.077" offset="1439208">--Well, there's another side to it, too, that you don't have to reach the question of the federal-state relations question if you decide the constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.853" offset="1486333">That is to say that if you... and I'm optimistic enough to assume that I'm right on both questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.521" offset="1512978">If you decide that question, you're deciding a question you would never have to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.472" offset="1536801">And I'm saying that a mechanical application of the rule really runs counter to the policy of trying to decide as little as you have to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.827" offset="1586225">And frankly, I would hope that you would reach the question of due process and equal protection, and I think if you will and if you decide it, this little Alabama statute will be gone and you will never have to face the Hanna versus Plumer question.</text>

            <label>Mr. L. Vastine Stabler, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="403.295" offset="1752050">Well, I guess I'll take the coward's way out and follow your suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.465" offset="1772739">I think the question of the federal-state relations question really has to be looked at analytically two ways:</text>
            <text syncTime="419.225" offset="1815789">First, as to whether it's a matter that's controlled by the federal rules, in which case it comes under Hanna versus Plumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.269" offset="1847972">If not, then we have to dive further into the Erie policy considerations if it's not controlled by the federal rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.734" offset="1889873">As I see it... and we made a note of this in our reply brief... the difference between the parties is that they claim that there must be a direct conflict in the sense that there must be a word to be found in the federal rules of appellate procedure or a sentence which specifically prohibits an affirmance penalty for there to be a conflict between the state... the federal appellate procedure and the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.170" offset="2055593">We maintain that the scope of the rules is such that the subject matter is controlled.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.712" offset="2097703">I think the words that we lifted from Hanna versus Plumer are "the situation is covered", or words to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.912" offset="2142529">I think in the Walker case there was a reference to whether it is within the scope of the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.831" offset="2170219">And I think that it is quite clear that the federal rules of appellate procedure specifically cover really all of the rules of procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.046" offset="2223090">I think it's interesting--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="523.590" offset="2233226">Well, you know, I think you have a hard time, going back to the result that the Court reached in Cohen versus Beneficial Loan, if you say that so long as the federal rules are kind of internally consistent and seem to deal with all the things these people thought about there's no place for a state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.786" offset="2318072">Certainly that's not the approach the Court took in Cohen versus Beneficial Loan.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="l_vastine_stabler_jr" startTime="548.487" stopTime="720.371">
            <label>Mr. L. Vastine Stabler, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="548.487" offset="2332805">--Well, I've got two distinctions from what you've said, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.798" offset="2354121">The first is I think there is a very definite difference between the Rules of Civil Procedure and the Rules of Appellate Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.170" offset="2383587">We noted in our briefs both Rule 1 and the comment to Rule 1, which are to the effect that the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure are controlling with respect to appellate rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.490" offset="2456834">There is no comparable phrase in the Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.144" offset="2483479">If I may use the analogy, it's a little like a contract which says, this is the entire agreement between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.641" offset="2513468">It has that kind of provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.422" offset="2520573">I think the nature of the appellate rules are that they are contained, while there is much more interaction in civil rules with state substantive rules than is true in the appellate rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.695" offset="2589641">Secondly, though, Cohen was based upon a solid view that there was a state substantive policy that was being recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.628" offset="2649409">I brought to you perhaps the most graphic example of the substantive policy of the Code of Alabama or the Alabama legislature, dealing with the Alabama affirmance penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.575" offset="2701236">This is in title 12, which deals with courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.821" offset="2726209">It is in chapter 22, which deals with appellate proceedings; and it is in division 5, which deals with the disposition of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.238" offset="2787858">Now, if you are looking, as they did in Cohen, for a state policy which is a substantive policy, you will not find it.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.718" offset="2833729">This code is adopted by the Alabama legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.199" offset="2851701">They have organized this particular provision to come within a section of the code which serves a function quite the same as the function of the rules of appellate procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.865" offset="2910320">That is quite different from Cohen.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.630" offset="2925366">I was reading a comment by Justice Harlan in his concurring opinion in Hanna versus Plumer where he says at the end of the opinion that anyone practicing law at that time was aware of the substantive policies tied to the bonding statutes that were involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="720.371" offset="3020348">Of course, the substantive policy was to discourage strike suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.383" offset="3040410">Here you could say that there is a substantive policy in Alabama to discourage delay on the part of defendants against whom a judgment has been rendered and who supersede the judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="746.750" offset="3125882">I thought your most recent argument was that Alabama has no substantive policy; it's just a point of appellate procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.842" offset="3158274">But an awful lot of points of procedure are based on substantive policy, as I continue to think Cohen versus Beneficial Loan was.</text>

            <text syncTime="764.275" offset="3195995">I was responding to Cohen versus Beneficial Loan, which is a case that predates Hanna versus Plumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.304" offset="3224103">But I believe that the appropriate analysis in this particular case is to inquire first as to whether the Rules of Appellate Procedure are applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.485" offset="3280841">Now, you use the federal rule to set the amount of bond, not the state rule, the supersedeas bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.608" offset="3313337">You use the federal rule, not the state rule, to control the interest that is to be assessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.839" offset="3338206">You use the federal rule, not the state rule, when dealing with the question of whether there is a frivolous appeal under Rule 38.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.649" offset="3373523">Every incident of this appeal is controlled by the Rules of Appellate Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.739" offset="3397869">And I submit that the Rules of Appellate Procedure are in scope complete and designed to control the subject matter of this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.906" offset="3454503">Now, if I'm correct in that submission, Hanna versus Plumer itself recognizes that the substantive policies of the state are not necessarily to be controlling.</text>

            <text syncTime="1365.760" offset="5601977">I will address first the alleged conflict between the Alabama affirmance fee and Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.303" offset="5652132">As I understand what Mr. Stabler's been saying is that it must be an irreconcilable conflict between the rule and the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.282" offset="5708034">Of course, we recognize that the federal courts have rulemaking power.</text>

            <text syncTime="1417.865" offset="5810330">We say it does not, for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.879" offset="5822450">The first is, the federal rules do not have any provision awarding any affirmance fee for an unsuccessful appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.142" offset="5867486">Now, there is a difference between an unsuccessful appeal and an appeal taken for the purpose of delay or frivolously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.948" offset="5910640">We're not talking about the delay appeals necessarily, although that is one of the functions of the affirmance fee, is to prevent delay appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="1454.257" offset="5955884">But it goes further, and there is a reason that there is no conflict, one of the reasons, between the Alabama affirmance fee and Rule 38.</text>

            <text syncTime="1772.917" offset="7230555">Right now we know that we've got invoked all over this country... today in Alabama we are having an election of a governor, which you all know about, and one of the hottest issues in this election is tort reform.</text>

            <text syncTime="1946.912" offset="7926561">It's the ten percent, as I understand it, and as you say in your own brief, it's compensation for the stay of execution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1984.380" offset="8076400">And what I can say to you is is what the status of the cases at this time is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.331" offset="8100224">The Fifth Circuit, before there was a division between the Fifth and the Eleventh, in two cases upheld the Alabama affirmance fee in diversity cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.217" offset="8155708">Later, they did in a Mississippi case, that went up from Mississippi, hold that there was an irreconcilable conflict between the Mississippi statute and the Alabama and the federal rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.835" offset="8214222">They held that, and by so doing they stated that they were not applying the Fifth Circuit's Alabama affirmance fee any more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.160" offset="8247554">But the Eleventh Circuit had held prior to that that the Alabama affirmance fee was not in conflict with the rules and was not unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.187" offset="8295619">And then after... it was the Affholder case that's referred to in both briefs... the Fifth Circuit's ruling, then the Eleventh Circuit was asked to reconsider its previous holdings, because the Eleventh Circuit had changed its ruling on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.195" offset="8371688">And that was the case of Jackson versus Magnolia Brokerage Company, and then there was our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.911" offset="8398542">And they asked... the Eleventh Circuit then, a panel, adhering to their former rule, as they are required to do, refused to overrule their former position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.998" offset="8450891">And then a petition for an en banc reconsideration was filed, and it was overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.201" offset="8483701">And that case came to this Court by writ of... a petition for a writ of certiorari, which was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.070" offset="8511182">But in the petition for a writ of certiorari, they based their contentions solely on the fact that there was an irreconcilable conflict between the rule, the federal rule, and the affirmance fee statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.175" offset="8571577">I have made a list of some of the things here that I think justify a distinction between the... I mean, reasons why both rules can be held applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.508" offset="8660916">In the first place, our rule, our affirmance fee, is mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.101" offset="8679306">Rule 38 and affirmance the statute have different fields of operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.894" offset="8710444">Alabama in McAnnally versus Levco held directly that... and we do have a Rule 38 that's almost identical to the federal Rule 38, and in this case of McAnnally versus Levco, Inc., 456 Southern 2d 66, our court held that there was a field of operation for both the statute and the rule, and applied the damages, ten percent, and then applied damages for the wrongful taking of the delaying tactics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.238" offset="8863835">In that case, what they did, they filed an appeal and just never did... and filed a supersedeas bond, but never even prosecuted the appeal at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.000" offset="8902914">In that case, our court held that they were liable on both of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.467" offset="8920782">If there are no more questions on that, I will get to what I consider the crux of the case, on the due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="2229.423" offset="9056619">It's an old case, yes, but this statute's old, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.608" offset="9073337">This statute has been in force in Alabama for 166 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.183" offset="9099668">I haven't been around 166 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="2245.603" offset="9121298">But I cannot find any record anywhere that any Supreme Court Justice has ever held or said that there was no reason for not applying the affirmance fee statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.566" offset="9189112">In that period of time, of course, we've had many legislative sessions to meet, and to my knowledge no legislature as yet... maybe tomorrow after the election, but so far I don't think any legislative proposal has ever been made to change it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.026" offset="9262986">Well, that's got to indicate something.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.839" offset="9270196">It must indicate that it works pretty good to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.665" offset="9281585">I know that you can't get grandfathered constitutional rights, but if it's been working to the satisfaction of the people of Alabama for 166 years it sounds pretty good.</text>

            <text syncTime="2333.007" offset="9470921">But yet, in their petition for writ of certiorari at page 9 in a footnote they say this:</text>

            <text syncTime="2358.106" offset="9571335">And then they say this further:</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.387" offset="9580426">"We contend that modern principles of due process, discussed infra, called into question the continued validity of Stewart. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.600" offset="9621281">What he said in his petition was that it's been decided against him in Stewart, but this Court's going to have to overrule Stewart in order to rule in his favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.174" offset="9671541">Well, Stewart... I don't know what Justice Holmes decided, really had in mind, what was before him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.607" offset="9721278">But I do know this: In the syllabus... and I realize what the function of a syllabus is, but this is a 1916 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.821" offset="9754193">The syllabus of the case says:</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.634" offset="9761402">"Due process provision of the Fourteenth Amendment does not require a state to provide for suspension of judgments pending appeal, nor preventing its making it costly in case a judgment is upheld, nor is due process denied by adding ten percent, as is done under the statute of Kentucky, on the amount of judgment if the same is affirmed. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.124" offset="9859414">And in this case, he affirmed both the ten percent penalty and the interest provided by the law of Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.199" offset="9899642">And in his opinion he discussed one or two matters, and then he said:</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.225" offset="9939766">"The first of the other objections is that the Court of Appeals was not authorized to add ten percent damages on the amount of the judgment as it did. "</text>

            <text syncTime="2980.761" offset="12061954">--Yes, sir, I think it's fair, yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.416" offset="12072508">I think it's fair because where is the incentive for a losing plaintiff to take a losing appeal?</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.819" offset="12118170">In the first place, he's got to give a bond to make the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.582" offset="12137187">He's got to buy a copy of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.112" offset="12147322">He's got to employ or pay an attorney to take the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.328" offset="12168220">And then if he wins, all he's done is he's thrown it back into court to try his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.733" offset="12189850">And if he loses it, it's all for naught.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.372" offset="12200403">But the defendant has the benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.981" offset="12210852">If the defendant loses and still pays the penalty, he still has had the benefit of that money during that period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.931" offset="12242617">Now, there's where the quid pro quo comes into play, that the plaintiff... the defendant has got a quid pro quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.896" offset="12278457">They are keeping the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.738" offset="12285876">The plaintiff wants it, he needs it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.051" offset="12295071">Just look at the Eleventh Circuit case in here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.471" offset="12308759">Here is a man who is a machinist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.377" offset="12316387">According to the Eleventh Circuit's opinion which I referred to, he was permanently disabled, permanently rendered less able to work and make a living.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.247" offset="12363825">He had had two operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.152" offset="12371453">He needed his money when he got his judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.352" offset="12396321">Now, who is taking advantage of whom?</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.585" offset="12409174">The defendant comes to him after that, and we know what happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.850" offset="12426310">You know it happens, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.256" offset="12431953">He comes: Well, you've got a judgment for $300; I can appeal it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.769" offset="12445954">I need my money, I need my money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.612" offset="12457344">Well, we're going to appeal it unless you knock off something.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.094" offset="12483257">Well, say they don't put that in there, but they most likely would.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.591" offset="12509275">Who has got the upper hand on those dealings?</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.183" offset="12527665">Are they dealing on an equal basis?</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.682" offset="12537592">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.526" offset="12541040">The defendant has got the advantage because they have got the money and they are holding it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.977" offset="12566744">He's needing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.555" offset="12573118">He's going to have to wait for it, and under the economic conditions that we've had in the last several years.</text>

            <text syncTime="3123.081" offset="12631215">Yes, Your Honor, I do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.127" offset="12635394">I would like to comment on several points that were made during the last part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.999" offset="12658904">I suppose the first one is to deal with LEN versus Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.294" offset="12676041">I suppose that in our petition for certiorari we too relied upon the syllabus that it was a due process case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.057" offset="12707074">But we have since obtained a copy of the briefs, which I assume you have judicial notice of here, and it is quite clear from the briefs that that case was basically a case involving the scope of the Federal Employers Liability Act, somewhat like the Bombalis case which was decided about that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.907" offset="12794532">It was a state court case dealing with an FELA action, and the question was not the constitutionality of the statute, but whether, because it was an FELA statute, it was preempted by federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.167" offset="12859525">And I will cite you to the assignment number one that's in the plaintiff's... I mean, in the railroad's brief, which I believe is the total argument presented to Justice Holmes on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.722" offset="12921801">The opinion says the question is whether or not they are, I believe the word is, "authorized", what is authorized to apply the ten percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.953" offset="12962656">The holding in the case is that it is a state procedural matter, I might add, Your Honor, a procedural matter, and thus was not to be included within the Federal Employers Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.119" offset="13019394">He subsequently cited the Dickenson case, which we've cited in our reply brief, in which he cited it for that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.021" offset="13050950">There is not one mention of any constitutional issue other than the issue of preemption or supremacy clause under the FELA and that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.188" offset="13099642">And I do not believe that that case... I know it was not argued and it was not decided on any question dealing with due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.248" offset="13139871">I would also like to take issue with Mr. Haley's reference that this does not represent a windfall for the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.134" offset="13179473">By definition, a jury has determined what the damages in this case are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.351" offset="13200266">They were determined to be quite a bit, I might add, in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.833" offset="13222209">There is no finding of any sort of any additional damages to the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.096" offset="13251257">There has been no trial to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.861" offset="13258362">It is an arbitrary matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.564" offset="13265154">Mr. Haley said that there had been a question that there was the loss with respect to the use of money during the time between trial and appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.967" offset="13306741">The interest statutes are there under the state and the federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.511" offset="13332968">I might add, Justice Scalia, I do believe the interest statute is in a different situation, because the federal statute there is far more specific than the issue you have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.177" offset="13383541">And I might add--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="3315.160" offset="13399528">Still, interest on a voluntary loan is one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.002" offset="13414888">Interest on an involuntary loan is something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.314" offset="13428158">One person shouldn't have the right to get money from somebody else so long as he pays the going rate of interest if the other person doesn't want to loan it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.452" offset="13456684">And the statute here simply says, if you owe the money you owe it, if the other fellow doesn't want to lend it to you at 5.75 or whatever a rate is, pay ten percent if you keep it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.354" offset="13500256">It seems fair to me.</text>

            <text syncTime="3343.024" offset="13511019">In fact, the National Marine Cooks case probably would indicate that, if there were no protection, probably both as to the property protection of a bond and the protection of interest, that it may be unconstitutional to stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.377" offset="13584370">I'd not deciding that case, but certainly there's a suggestion that there's a constitutional issue if these provisions are not allowed.</text>
