            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="8.639" offset="126395">This is a petition for certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.122" offset="144367">The essential facts are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.974" offset="155756">A bullet was fired through the floor of Hicks' apartment, injuring a man in the room below.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.891" offset="183446">Police entered the apartment to search for the shooter, for other victims, and for weapons.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.609" offset="206329">They found and seized three weapons including a sawed-off riffle and saw in one of the rooms a stocking-cap mask.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.227" offset="240811">One of the policemen, Officer Nelson, noticed two sets of expensive stereo components which seemed out of place in what was otherwise an ill-appointed apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.834" offset="283234">Suspecting that these components were stolen he moved some of them in order to read and record their serial numbers and reported these numbers by phone to his headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.897" offset="327433">After learning that one of them, the turntable had been taken in an armed robbery he seized it.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.444" offset="357631">When Hicks was indicted for the robbery the State Trial Court granted his motion to suppress the evidence that had been seized as a consequence of the discovery of the turntable's serial number.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.118" offset="400367">The Arizona Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.500" offset="413846">In this Court the state has conceded that prior to disturbing the turntable, Officer Nelson did not have probable cause to believe it had been stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.885" offset="451358">We therefore do not consider that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.471" offset="461702">The state asserts however that Officer Nelson did have a reasonable suspicion and that this was sufficient to satisfy the Fourth Amendment, in light of the minimal intrusion on Hicks' privacy that the search produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.798" offset="515097">The reasons discussed in the filed opinion, we hold that probable cause is required for search of an object that lawfully comes within a police officer's plain view, just as it would be required for its seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.179" offset="564625">And we hold that the moving of stereo equipment to expose to view what had been concealed constituted a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.998" offset="599838">We reject the concept of some third category of police action between search and non search which can be justified on a basis less than probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.240" offset="640798">Justice Powell has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Justice O'Connor have joined; Justice O'Connor has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Justice Powell have joined.</text>
